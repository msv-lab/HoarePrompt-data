### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ap`) and processes each test case by reading the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) and 2x2 icons (`y`).

2. **Screen Calculation**:
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0**:
     - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons.
     - It then subtracts the space occupied by these 2x2 icons from the total available space, converting the 2x2 icons into equivalent 1x1 icon spaces (`y * 4`), and subtracts this from the total 1x1 icon spaces (`x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`).
     - If the remaining 1x1 icons (`x`) are positive, it calculates the additional screens needed for these icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - Finally, it adds the screens required for 2x2 icons and the screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons and prints the result.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0**:
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0**:
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens required for 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0**:
     - The program correctly prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where both `x` and `y` are 0.
   - It also handles cases where one of `x` or `y` is 0 correctly.

4. **Mathematical Correctness**:
   - The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the program correctly rounds up to the nearest integer, which is necessary for calculating the minimum number of screens required.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct number of screens for each test case as per the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the given cases and edge conditions. The logic for calculating the minimum number of screens is sound and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
