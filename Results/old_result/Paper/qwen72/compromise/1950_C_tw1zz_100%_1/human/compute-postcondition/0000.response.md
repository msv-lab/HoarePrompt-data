The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
