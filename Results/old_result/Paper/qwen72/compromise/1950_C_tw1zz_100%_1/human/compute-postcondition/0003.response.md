Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is from 00 to 23 and `mm` is from 00 to 59) and converts it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. The converted time is printed for each test case. The function does not modify the input variables `t` or `s`. **
