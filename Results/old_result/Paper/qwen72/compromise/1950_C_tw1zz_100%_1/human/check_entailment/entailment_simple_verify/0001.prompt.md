You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: The variable `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and the variable `s` remains a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where hh is an integer from 00 to 23 and mm is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in 24-hour format. The loop will print the converted time in 12-hour format for each iteration, but the variables `t` and `s` themselves are not modified by the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string `hh:mm` using `input().split(':')`, which splits the string into two parts: `h` (hours) and `m` (minutes).

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The function uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour `h` to the 12-hour format hour `h1` and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - For hours from `01` to `11`, the function correctly sets `h1` to the same hour and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour `12`, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hours from `13` to `23`, the function correctly subtracts `12` from the hour and sets `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour `00`, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`.
   - The `sep=''` argument ensures that there are no extra spaces between the components of the time string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles all edge cases, including `00:00`, `12:00`, and `23:59`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly converts a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement. The logic and output formatting are correct.
