Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is 12 during the AM period correctly. According to the problem description, the time "12:00" in 24-hour format should be "12:00 AM" in 12-hour format, but the program only sets the hour to "12" and the time to "PM" when the hour is "12". This means that for the input "12:00", the program will output "12:00 PM" instead of "12:00 AM".
