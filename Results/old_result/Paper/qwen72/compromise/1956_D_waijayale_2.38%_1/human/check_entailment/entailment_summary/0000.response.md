Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to modify the array `a` and the list `ops` by setting elements from index `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If `l` equals `r`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 if `a[l]` is not already 0 and appends the tuple `(l, l)` to `ops`.
   - The function ensures that the segment from `l` to `r` is set to the MEX of that segment, which is `r - l + 1` if `a[l]` is not already the MEX. This is a valid operation according to the problem description.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array `a` from index 0 to `n-1`.
   - It returns a tuple containing the sum of the modified array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - The function does not alter the input list `a` directly but relies on the recursive function to modify it.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function checks if the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of this sublist. If so, it calls `func_1` to update the sublist and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - If the sum is greater, it recursively processes the sublists before and after the maximum element in `a[l:r + 1]`.
   - The function ensures that the array `a` is modified to maximize the sum while keeping track of the operations in `ops`.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the results.
   - It correctly prints the sum `s` and the number of operations `m`.
   - It also prints the operations in the format required by the problem.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the MEX of a segment and updates the segment to the MEX value.
- The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` ensures that the array is processed in a way that maximizes the sum.
- The operations are tracked and printed correctly, adhering to the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the array while adhering to the constraints on the number of operations and the format of the output.

Correctness: **True**
