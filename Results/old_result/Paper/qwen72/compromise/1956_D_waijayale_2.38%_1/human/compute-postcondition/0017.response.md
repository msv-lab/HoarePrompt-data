Functionality: ** The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two parameters `l` and `r`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= l <= r < len(a), where `a` is a list of integers. It modifies the list `a` and the list `ops` in the following ways: If the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` is less than or equal to the square of the length of this sublist, it updates all elements in this sublist to the length of the sublist and appends the tuple `(l, r)` to the list `ops`. If the sum is greater, it recursively applies the same logic to the sublists before and after the maximum element in `a[l:r + 1]`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `a` will have been modified according to the rules described, and the list `ops` will contain tuples representing the ranges of sublists that were updated. **
