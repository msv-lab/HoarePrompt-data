The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`, and the loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other details about the function parameters and the conditions on `t` and `n` do not directly affect the loop head, but they are important for the context of the loop's execution.

Given that the function should take an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and the loop is iterating over the range of `t`, the state needs to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
