Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where n is even, and two strings of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    if b[-2] != '>':
        print('NO')
    elif n == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        no_path = True
        for k in range(0, n, 2):
            if b[k] != '>':
                no_path = False
        if not no_path:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                print(k)
                if a[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
        if no_path:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not `>`, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `no_path`. If the second-to-last character of `b` is `>`, and if `n` is 1, no changes are made to `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, or `no_path`. If `n` is not 1, `k` is the last even number less than `n` if `no_path` is initially True, and `k` remains the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is initially False, `k` is the last odd number less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index (1, 3, 5, ..., `k`) in `a` is not `>`, `no_path` remains False. Otherwise, `no_path` is True. Additionally, if `no_path` is initially False, then `no_path` is set to False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `no_path` is a boolean value. If `b[-2]` is not '>', all variables retain their initial values. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` == 1, all variables retain their initial values. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` > 1, and `no_path` is True, all variables retain their initial values. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` > 1, and `no_path` is False, `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n-1` if `n` is odd, or the last odd number less than `n` if `n` is even, and `no_path` remains False if any character at an odd index (from 1 to `k`) in string `a` is not '>', otherwise `no_path` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input strings. If `b[-2]` is not equal to `>`, the state of `no_path` remains unchanged. If `b[-2]` is equal to `>`, and `n` == 1, the state of `no_path` remains unchanged. If `b[-2]` is equal to `>`, and `n` > 1, `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` was True before the if-else block, it remains True. If `no_path` was False before the if-else block, it remains False if any character at an odd index (1, 3, 5, ..., `k-1`) in `a` is not `>`. Otherwise, `no_path` becomes True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
