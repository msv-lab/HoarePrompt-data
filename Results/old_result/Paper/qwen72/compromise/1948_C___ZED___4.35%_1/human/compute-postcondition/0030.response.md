The code snippet provided is:

```python
print(k)
```

Based on the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 4.
- `a` is an input string.
- `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character being `>`.
- `k` is 3.
- If the character at index 1 of `a` is not `>`, `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

The `print` statement only involves the variable `k`, which is explicitly defined as 3. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **3**
