The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The initial state describes the values of variables `i`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
