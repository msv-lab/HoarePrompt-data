You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where n is even, and two strings of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string, `b` is the last input string, and `no_path` is the final boolean value determined by the conditions in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It returns a list of boolean values, where each value indicates whether it is possible to make the arrows in both strings point in the same direction by swapping characters within the same string.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
