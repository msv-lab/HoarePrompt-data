Output State: **`i` is `t-1`, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string, `b` is the last input string, and `no_path` is the final boolean value determined by the conditions in the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, so after all iterations, `i` will be `t-1` (since the loop starts with `i` at 0 and increments `i` by 1 each time).
- `n`, `a`, and `b` will be the values of the last test case input.
- `no_path` will be the final boolean value determined by the conditions in the loop for the last test case. If the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>', `no_path` will be `False` (and the output will be 'NO'). If the second-to-last character of `b` is '>', and `n` is 1, `no_path` will be `True` (and the output will be 'YES'). If `n` is greater than 1, `no_path` will be determined by the conditions in the nested loops:
  - If all characters at even indices in `b` are '>', and all characters at odd indices in `a` (up to the last odd index less than `n-1`) are '>', then `no_path` will be `True` (and the output will be 'YES').
  - Otherwise, `no_path` will be `False` (and the output will be 'NO').
