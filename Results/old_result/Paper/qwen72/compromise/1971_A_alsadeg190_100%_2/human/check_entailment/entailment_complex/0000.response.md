Reasoning:  
The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers `x` and `y` for `t` test cases. However, there are a few issues in the implementation:

1. **Variable Naming Conflict**: The function reads an integer `x` which is used to determine the number of test cases. This `x` is then used in the loop, but it conflicts with the `x` that is read from the input for each test case. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs.

2. **Loop Variable Naming**: The loop variable `i` is not used within the loop, which is fine, but it is a common practice to use `_` for such variables to indicate that the value is not used.

3. **Function Signature**: The function `func` does not accept any parameters, which is not ideal for reusability. However, this is not a correctness issue for the given problem.

4. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `x` and then reads `x` pairs of integers. This is correct based on the problem description.

5. **Output**: The function correctly prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Given these points, the function will work correctly for the problem described, but it has some naming issues that could be improved for clarity. However, these issues do not affect the correctness of the program in terms of solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
