Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` initializes a list `nums` of `n` zeros.
   - The loop iterates `n` times, and in each iteration, it sets `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number that can be represented with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit in `k`.
   - The value of `k` is then reduced by `nums[i]` in each iteration.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining value of `k` to the last element of the sequence: `nums[-1] += k`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach sets each element of the sequence to the largest possible value that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k`. This ensures that the highest bit is set in as many elements as possible, which is a good strategy to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - However, the function `func_1` has a critical flaw. The value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is the largest number that can be represented with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit in `k`. This value is very large and can easily exceed `k` itself, especially when `n` is large. For example, if `k` is 5 and `n` is 2, the value `(1 << 5.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is 3 (binary `11`). Setting both elements to 3 would result in a total sum of 6, which exceeds `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 1, the function will set `nums[0]` to `k`, which is correct.
   - If `k` is 0, the function will set all elements to 0, which is also correct.
   - However, for larger `n` and `k`, the function can set elements to values that exceed `k`, leading to an incorrect sum.

5. **Verification:**
   - The function does not correctly handle the constraints and ensure that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k` for all cases.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence will not necessarily have the maximum number of 1s because the function can set elements to values that are too large, leading to an incorrect sum and potentially reducing the number of 1s in the OR result.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct as it prints each sequence on a new line, separated by spaces.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k` for all cases, and it can set elements to values that exceed `k`.

Final: **False**
