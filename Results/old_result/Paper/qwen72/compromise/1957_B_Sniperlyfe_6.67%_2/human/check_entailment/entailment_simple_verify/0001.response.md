Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.
   - The sequence should maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros.
   - The loop iterates `n` times, setting each `nums[i]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k`.
   - After setting `nums[i]`, the function subtracts this value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adds any remaining value of `k` to the last element of the sequence: `nums[-1] += k`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach sets each element of the sequence to the largest possible value that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k`. This ensures that the highest bit is set in as many elements as possible, which maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - However, the key issue is that the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit in `k`. This value is very large and can quickly exceed `k` when `n` is greater than 1.
   - For example, if `k = 5` and `n = 2`, the highest bit in `k` is 2 (since `5` in binary is `101`). The value `(1 << 2 - 1) - 1` is `3` (binary `11`). If we set both `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` to `3`, the total sum would be `6`, which exceeds `k`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 1, the function will set `nums[0]` to `k`, which is correct.
   - If `k` is 0, the function will set all elements to 0, which is also correct.
   - However, if `k` is less than the largest number that can be represented with the highest bit set in `k` and `n > 1`, the function will incorrectly set multiple elements to the same large value, causing the sum to exceed `k`.

5. **Verification:**
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where `k` is small and `n` is large. It will set multiple elements to the same large value, which is not feasible.
   - For example, in the test case `2 5`, the function will set both `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` to `3`, resulting in a sum of `6`, which is incorrect.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct as it prints each sequence on a new line, separated by spaces.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k` is small and `n` is large correctly. The sum of the sequence can exceed `k` in such cases.

Final: **False**
