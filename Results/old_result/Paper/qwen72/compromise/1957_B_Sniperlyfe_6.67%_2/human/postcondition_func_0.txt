The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of `n` integers. Each integer in the list, except the last one, is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The last integer in the list is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. After the function concludes, the value of `k` is reduced by `n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.
