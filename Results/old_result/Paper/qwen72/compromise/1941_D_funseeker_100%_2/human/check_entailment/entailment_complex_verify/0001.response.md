### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and strip any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_1()` reads a line of input and returns it as a string.
   - `func_2()` reads a line of input, converts it to an integer, and returns it.
   - `func_3()` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each part to an integer, and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_4()` processes each test case using the above functions to read and parse the input.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This set will keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.

3. **Processing Throws**:
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then iterates over the current set of possible positions `ans`.
   - For each position `q`:
     - If the direction is '0' (clockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
     - If the direction is '1' (counterclockwise) or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - After processing all possible positions for the current throw, it updates `ans` to `temp`.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the position `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is because in a circular arrangement, position `0` is equivalent to position `n`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of possible positions.
   - It then prints the sorted list of possible positions.

### Detailed Evaluation:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) are correctly implemented to read and process the input as described in the problem.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` ensures that any trailing newline characters are removed, which is appropriate for the input format.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`. This ensures that the initial position of the ball is correctly tracked.

3. **Processing Throws**:
   - The loop iterates `m` times, which is the number of throws.
   - For each throw, the program correctly reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - The program correctly updates the set of possible positions `ans` by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise movements if the direction is '0' or '?'.
   - The use of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` ensures that the positions wrap around correctly in a circular arrangement.
   - The handling of the '?' direction is correct, as it considers both possible directions.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where position `0` is equivalent to position `n` by removing `0` from the set and adding `n` to the set if `0` is present in `ans`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the number of possible positions and the sorted list of possible positions.

### Annotations and State Verification:

- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `func_1()`: No variables are used, and it returns a string.
  - `func_2()`: No variables are used, and it returns an integer.
  - `func_3()`: No variables are used, and it returns a list of integers.
  - `func_4()`: `n`, `m`, and `x` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 1000`, `1 <= m <= 1000`, and `1 <= x <= n`.

- **State of the program after the function call**:
  - `func_1()`: Returns a string representing the user's input.
  - `func_2()`: Returns an integer derived from the output of `func_1()`.
  - `func_3()`: Returns a list of integers derived from the output of `func_1()`.
  - `func_4()`: `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?', or just `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1'. If `0` is present in `ans`, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set. The function prints the length of `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The program is correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. It handles all the given constraints and edge cases appropriately. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
