Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `func_1` and `func_3` to read input from `stdin`. `func_1` reads a single line and strips any trailing newline characters, while `func_3` reads a line, splits it by spaces, and converts each part to an integer. This is a standard and correct way to handle input in Python.

2. **Test Case Loop**: The main loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **Initial Setup**: For each test case, `func_4` initializes `n`, `m`, and `x` using `func_3`. It then initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

4. **Throw Processing**: The program processes each throw by reading the distance `r` and the direction `c`. It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw. This is done by:
   - Adding `(q + r) % n` to `temp` if the throw is clockwise or the direction is unknown.
   - Adding `(q - r) % n` to `temp` if the throw is counterclockwise or the direction is unknown.
   - Updating `ans` to be the set `temp`.

   This logic correctly handles all three possible directions ('0', '1', '?') and ensures that all possible positions are considered.

5. **Handling Zero Position**: After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`, and `0` should be treated as `n`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is correct as per the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
