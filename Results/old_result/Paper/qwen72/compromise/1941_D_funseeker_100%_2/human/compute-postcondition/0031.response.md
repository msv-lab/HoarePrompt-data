Output State: **`ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, `q` is an element of `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space and is now an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `c` is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- `q` is an element of the set `ans`.
- `r` is an integer derived from the first element of the string returned by `func_1()`.
- `n` is a value returned by `func_3()`.
- The other variables (`m`, `x`, and `c`) are not affected by this code.
- The set `temp`, which was initially empty, now contains the value `(q + r) % n`.
