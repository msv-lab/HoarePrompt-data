Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all the values that were added to `temp` during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `temp`. `temp` is a set containing all the values that were added to it during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `ans`. `_` is incremented by 1, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`. `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`.**
