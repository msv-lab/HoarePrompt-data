The only objects in the loop head are the variable `q` and the set `ans`. The loop iterates over each element `q` in the set `ans`. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in `ans` to iterate over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', the value `(q - r) % n` has been added to `temp`.
- If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', the state of `ans` and `temp` remains unchanged.

At the start of the next iteration, `q` will be the next element in the set `ans`. The set `ans` must have at least one more element for the loop to execute again.

State: **`ans` is a set containing at least two unique values of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', the value `(q - r) % n` has been added to `temp`. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', the state of `ans` and `temp` remains unchanged.**
