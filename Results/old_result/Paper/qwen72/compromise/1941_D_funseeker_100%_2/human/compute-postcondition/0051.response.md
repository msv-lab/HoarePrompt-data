Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all the values that were added to `temp` during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `temp`. `_` is incremented by 1, `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`. `r` is the first value returned by `func_1().split()` converted to an integer, and `c` is the second value returned by `func_1().split()`. `temp` is now an empty set.**
