Output State: **`ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `q` is an element of `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space and is now an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, and `c` is either '1' or '?'.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds a new value to the set `temp`.
- The value added is `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is an element of `ans`, `r` is an integer, and `n` is a value returned by `func_3()`.
- Since `c` is either '1' or '?', and the initial state already mentions that `temp` contains `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', the updated `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
