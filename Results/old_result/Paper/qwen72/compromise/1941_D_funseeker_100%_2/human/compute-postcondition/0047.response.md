Output State: **`ans` is a set containing all the values that were added to `temp` during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `temp`. `temp` is a set containing all the values that were added to it during the loop iterations, which are the same as the final values in `ans`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `temp` to `ans`. This means that `ans` now contains the same set of values as `temp`. The initial conditions for `ans` and `temp` are no longer relevant after this assignment, as `ans` is now directly equal to `temp`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `ans` and confirms that `temp` remains unchanged.
