Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the next element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n`, and now also contains the value `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- Since `q` is the next element of `ans`, and `ans` contains at least 2 elements, `q` is a specific value.
- The value of `(q - r) % n` is calculated and added to `temp`.
- The conditions for `c` being '0' or '?' are still valid, and `temp` now contains both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.
- If `c` is not '0' or '?', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n`, and now it also contains `(q - r) % n`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged.
