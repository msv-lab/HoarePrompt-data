Output State: **`ans` is a set containing at least one unique value of `(q + r) % n` or `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. `q` is the next element of `ans`, `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is the first element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space and is now an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, and `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is neither '0' nor '?', the state of `ans` and `temp` remains unchanged. The value `(q - r) % n` has been added to `temp`.**

Explanation:
- The value `(q - r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `(q - r) % n` is not provided, but it is now included in the set `temp`.
