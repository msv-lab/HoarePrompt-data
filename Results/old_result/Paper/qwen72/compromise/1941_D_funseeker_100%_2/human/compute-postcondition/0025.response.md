The only object in the loop head is the variable `m`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `m`. If `m` is greater than 0, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` is decreased by 1, so `m` must be greater than 0 before the adjustment.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `ans` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`. `m` must be greater than 1, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. `temp` is a set containing the same values as the updated `ans`.**
