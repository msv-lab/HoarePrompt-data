Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space, `temp` is an empty set.**

The code initializes `temp` as an empty set, while the other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, and `c`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
