Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 1 element, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. `temp` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans` if `c` is '0' or '?'. If `c` is '1', `temp` contains all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The set `ans` must have at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
- The integer `r` and the character `c` (which is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space) also remain unchanged.
- The set `temp` is populated based on the conditions specified in the loop:
  - If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` will contain all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.
  - If `c` is '1', `temp` will contain all unique values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`.
- The loop will have iterated over all elements in `ans`, and `temp` will contain the results of the operations for each element in `ans` based on the value of `c`.
