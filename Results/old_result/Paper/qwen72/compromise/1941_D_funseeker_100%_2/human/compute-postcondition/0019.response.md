Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n` where `q` is the next element of `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the next element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.

```
temp.add((q + r) % n)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

1. **Identify the affected variables**: The code snippet affects the `temp` set by adding a new element to it.
2. **Check the initial state**:
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `m` must be greater than 0.
   - `r` is an integer.
   - `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space.
   - If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n` where `q` is the next element of `ans`.
   - If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the next element of `ans`.
   - Otherwise, `temp` remains an empty set.
3. **Calculate the result**:
   - The code snippet `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the `temp` set, where `q` is the next element of `ans`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and must have at least 2 elements, `m` must be greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second element of the string returned by `func_1()` split by a space. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the value `(q - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n` where `q` is the next element of `ans`. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`, where `q` is the next element of `ans`. Otherwise, `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n` where `q` is the next element of `ans`.**
