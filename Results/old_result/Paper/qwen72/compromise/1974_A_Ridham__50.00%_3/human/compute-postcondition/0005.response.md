Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two integers, `x` and `y`, where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. `x` represents the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon, and `y` represents the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters, so it currently does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
