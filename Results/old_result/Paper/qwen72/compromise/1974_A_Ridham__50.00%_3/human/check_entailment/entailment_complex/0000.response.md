Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it should take `x` and `y` as input parameters. However, the function reads `x` and `y` from the input inside the loop, so this is not a critical issue for the program's correctness.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to read the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

3. **Space Calculation**:
   - `space_x` is calculated as `x * 1`, which is correct since each 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.
   - `space_y` is calculated as `y * 4`, which is correct since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - `total_space` is the sum of `space_x` and `space_y`, which is correct.

4. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated as `y // 2` if `y` is even, or `y // 2 + 1` if `y` is odd. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons (8 cells), and if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons, an additional screen is needed for the last icon.

5. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons are calculated as `15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y`. This is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and the total number of cells used by 2x2 icons is `space_y`.

6. **Checking for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to fit all 1x1 icons (`space_x <= remaining_cells`), the number of screens required is `screen_require_for_y`.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the extra space required for 1x1 icons is calculated as `space_x - remaining_cells`. The number of additional screens needed is then calculated as `extra_space // 15 + 1` if `extra_space % 15 != 0`, which is correct.

7. **Output**:
   - The function appends the total number of screens required for each test case to the `result` list and then prints the results, one per line. This is correct and matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly handle the problem as described and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
