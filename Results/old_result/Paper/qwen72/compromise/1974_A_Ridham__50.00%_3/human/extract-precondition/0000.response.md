Precondition: **The function `func` is supposed to take two integers `x` and `y` as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99, representing the number of applications with a 1 x 1 icon and the number of applications with a 2 x 2 icon, respectively. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(x, y):`.**
