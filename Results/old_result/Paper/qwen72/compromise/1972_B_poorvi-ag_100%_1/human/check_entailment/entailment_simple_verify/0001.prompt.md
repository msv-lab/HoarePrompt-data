You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, where each character is either "U" or "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The variable `results` now contains a list of strings, where each string is either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the count of 'U' in the string `arr` for each test case is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` is equal to `t`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The variable `results` remains unchanged, containing the same list of strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no'. The loop has printed each element of `results` to the console, but the contents of `results` are not modified.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each either facing up ("U") or down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when no facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If there is an odd number of facing-up coins, the player who starts (Alice) can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains odd after her turn.
   - If there is an even number of facing-up coins, the player who starts (Alice) can only ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains even after her turn.
   - The game will eventually end when no facing-up coins are left, and the player who faces this situation loses.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob. Bob will then be forced to leave an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice, and this pattern will continue until Bob is left with no facing-up coins.
   - If the initial number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that the number of facing-up coins remains even. Eventually, Alice will be left with no facing-up coins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `arr`.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is odd, it appends 'yes' to the results list, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of 'U' coins is even, it appends 'no' to the results list, indicating Bob wins.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

5. **Verification of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the number of facing-up coins using `arr.count('U')`.
   - It correctly determines the winner based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation. It correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins, which aligns with the optimal play strategy.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
