#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, where each character is either "U" or "D" representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if arr.count('U') % 2 == 1:
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The variable `results` now contains a list of strings, where each string is either 'yes' or 'no' depending on whether the count of 'U' in the string `arr` for each test case is odd or even, respectively. The length of `results` is equal to `t`.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: The variable `results` remains unchanged, containing the same list of strings where each string is either 'yes' or 'no'. The loop has printed each element of `results` to the console, but the contents of `results` are not modified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of the number of coins and their states (either "U" or "D"). For each test case, the function checks if the number of coins facing up ("U") is odd. If it is, the function appends "yes" to a list; otherwise, it appends "no". After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of the list to the console. The function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes a list `results` containing "yes" or "no" for each test case, and this list is printed to the console.
