#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing your cow's index (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `ratings` is a list of integers of length `n` where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, with all ratings being distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive), and `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists. The values of `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive), and wins is greater than or equal to `k`)
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive), and `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists. The values of `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged. Additionally, `wins` is less than `k`.
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `win_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive) plus the number of elements from `a[k - 1]` to `a[k - 2]` (inclusive) that are also less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`. `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` starting from `win_with_swap` or `k - 1` if no such element exists. `wins`, `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)) (where `wins` is the value of `wins` and `win_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive) plus the number of elements from `a[k - 1]` to `a[k - 2]` (inclusive) that are also less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `max_wins` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of cows), `k` (an integer representing your cow's index, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `ratings` (a list of integers of length `n` where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, with all ratings being distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9). The function calculates the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by your cow (at index `k-1`) in a competition, either without swapping or by swapping your cow with another cow. It prints the result and does not return any value. The values of `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged after the function execution.
