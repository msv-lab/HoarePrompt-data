The function `win` is expected to take input parameters, but the provided function definition does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the number of cows `n`, the index of your cow `k`, and the list of Cowdeforces ratings `a`. Specifically, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
