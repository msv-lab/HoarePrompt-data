To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head: `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`.

### Initial State:
- `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive).
- `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists.
- `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.
- `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged.
- `wins` is less than `k`.

### Loop Head:
```
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
```

### Analysis:
1. **Range Condition**: The loop will execute if `win_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop will start with `i` set to `win_with_swap`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`win_with_swap`**: For the loop to execute, `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.
- **`i`**: `i` will be set to `win_with_swap` at the start of the loop.

### Final State:
- `wins` is less than `k` (unchanged).
- `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1` and must be less than `k - 1`.
- `i` is set to `win_with_swap`.

### State:
**`wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1` and must be less than `k - 1`, `i` is `win_with_swap`**
