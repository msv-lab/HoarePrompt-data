Postcondition: **`wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]` starting from the first element up to the element `a[k - 1]` (inclusive), and `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `a[k - 1]` or `n` if no such element exists. The values of `n`, `k`, and `ratings` remain unchanged. Additionally, `wins` is less than `k`.**
