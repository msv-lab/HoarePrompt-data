The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `a`.

- The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `n` is equal to `t`.
- After executing the code, the list `a` is populated with the integers from the input.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers from the input.**
