To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is equal to `t`.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` in `cnt` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

2. **Understanding `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is a frequency list where `cnt[i]` gives the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
   - For example, if `a = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, then `cnt` would be `[0, 1, 2, 3]` because:
     - `0` appears 0 times in `a`.
     - `1` appears 1 time in `a`.
     - `2` appears 2 times in `a`.
     - `3` appears 3 times in `a`.

3. **Calculating `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.
   - This means for each count `x` in `cnt`, we take the maximum of 0 and `x - 1`, and then sum these values.
   - For example, if `cnt = [0, 1, 2, 3]`:
     - `max(0, 0 - 1) = 0`
     - `max(0, 1 - 1) = 0`
     - `max(0, 2 - 1) = 1`
     - `max(0, 3 - 1) = 2`
     - Therefore, `ans = 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 3`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of max(0, x - 1) for all elements x in cnt)**
