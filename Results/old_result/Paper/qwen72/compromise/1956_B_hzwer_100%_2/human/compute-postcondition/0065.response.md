Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a sequence of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. It then counts how many times each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the sequence. The function calculates the sum of the maximum of 0 and the count of each integer minus 1. This sum is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
