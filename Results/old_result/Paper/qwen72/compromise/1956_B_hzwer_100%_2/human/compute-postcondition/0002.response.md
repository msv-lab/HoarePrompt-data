The code snippet assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `n`. Given the initial state, `int(input())` is equal to `t`, which is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). Therefore, `n` is assigned the value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`**.
