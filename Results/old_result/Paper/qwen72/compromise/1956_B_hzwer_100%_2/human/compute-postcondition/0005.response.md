Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `cnt` with `n + 1` elements, all set to zero. Since `n` is equal to `t`, the length of `cnt` is `t + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
