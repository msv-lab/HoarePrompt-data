Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least three elements, `cnt` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` except `cnt[x]` which is now 3, `x` is the third element in the list `a`.** 

Explanation: The value of `cnt[x]` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
