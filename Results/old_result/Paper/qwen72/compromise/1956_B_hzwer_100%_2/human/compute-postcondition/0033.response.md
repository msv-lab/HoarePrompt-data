Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1` where each element `cnt[x]` is the count of occurrences of `x` in `a`, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `ans`, which was the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
