The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`
- `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`

After executing the code snippet:
- The list `a` is updated with the new list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt` is a list of integers with length `n + 1`, and `ans` is the sum of `max(0, x - 1)` for all elements `x` in `cnt`.**
