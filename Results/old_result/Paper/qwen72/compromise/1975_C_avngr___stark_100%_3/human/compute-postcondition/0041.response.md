Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `temp` is a sorted list containing the elements from `a` starting at index 1 up to index 3 (or the end of the list if `a` has fewer than 3 elements after index 1), `max` is updated to the second element of `temp` if `temp[1]` is greater than the initial `max`, otherwise `max` remains 0.**
