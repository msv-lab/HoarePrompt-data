To determine what will be printed by the `print(min(a))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is `n - 3`.
   - `max` is the maximum value among the middle elements of all sorted sublists of length 3 from `a[0]` to `a[n-3]`.

2. **Task:**
   - The code snippet is `print(min(a))`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `min(a)` function will find the smallest element in the list `a`.
   - The list `a` is provided by the user, so its exact values are not known, but it is a list of integers.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(min(a))` statement will print the smallest integer in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **min(a) (where min(a) is the smallest integer in the list `a`)**
