You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        max = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of positive integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as input parameters. Additionally, it should handle multiple test cases, so the number of test cases `t` should also be an input parameter. Therefore, the correct function signature should be `def func(t, n, a):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 2:
            print(min(a))
            continue
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(n - 2):
            temp = a[i:i + 3]
            temp.sort()
            if temp[1] > max:
                max = temp[1]
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 3`, and `max` is the maximum of the middle elements of all possible sorted sublists of length 3 from the list `a` for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the program only considers subarrays of length 3, which is insufficient to find the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The expected output is `4`, as described in the problem statement. However, the program will output `3` because it only considers subarrays of length 3. The program will find the maximum median of subarrays of length 3, which is `3` in the subarray `[1, 2, 3]`.

### Why the Program is Incorrect:
- The program should consider all possible subarrays, not just those of length 3.
- The median of a subarray can be any element in the subarray, depending on the length and the values of the elements.
- The program needs to account for subarrays of all lengths from 2 to n to ensure it finds the maximum possible value that the array can be transformed into.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the maximum possible value that can be the median of any subarray.
2. Ensure that this value can be propagated to the entire array through the allowed operations.

The current implementation fails to meet these requirements, making it incorrect.
