Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works for every potential case:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by reading the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.

2. **Auxiliary String Construction**: For each encoded string `b`, the program constructs the auxiliary string `r` by first creating a set of distinct characters from `b` and then sorting them in alphabetical order. This step ensures that `r` contains all distinct characters from `b` in alphabetical order.

3. **Mapping Construction**: The program creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. This is done by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping `r[i]` to `r[-(i + 1)]`.

4. **Decoding**: The program decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character in the `mapping` dictionary. This step correctly reverses the encoding process described in the problem.

5. **Output**: The decoded strings are collected in the `results` list and printed at the end, each on a new line.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- Single-character strings.
- Strings with all distinct characters.
- Strings with repeated characters.
- The sum of the lengths of all strings in the input does not exceed the given limit.

Since the program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
