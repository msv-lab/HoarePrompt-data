Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to the specified algorithm. The algorithm involves creating an auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`. To decode, the program needs to reverse this process.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded string `b` itself.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function first creates the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then constructs a mapping dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping dictionary.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results of decoding each test case and prints them all at the end.

The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` correctly performs the decoding by creating a mapping of characters and replacing them as described. The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the decoded strings as expected.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the decoding algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
