The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character from the end of the sorted unique characters of `encoded` in reverse order, as defined by a mapping dictionary. The final state of the program is that the original `encoded` string is transformed into this new string, with the characters replaced according to the specified mapping.
