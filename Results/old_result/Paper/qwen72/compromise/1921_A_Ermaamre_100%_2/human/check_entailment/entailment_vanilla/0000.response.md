Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the input. This is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Reading Coordinates**: For each test case, the program reads four lines, each containing two integers `x_i` and `y_i`. These are the coordinates of the corners of the square. The program stores these coordinates in a list of lists `a`.

3. **Extracting X-coordinates**: The program then extracts the x-coordinates from the list `a` and stores them in a list `x`.

4. **Calculating Side Length**: The program calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx = max(x) - min(x)`). This is correct because the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, so the side length can be determined by the difference in either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates.

5. **Calculating Area**: The program calculates the area of the square by squaring the side length (`dx * dx`) and prints it. This is correct because the area of a square is the side length squared.

6. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times.

7. **Guaranteed Valid Input**: The problem guarantees that the input will always form a valid square with positive area and sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the program does not need to handle invalid inputs or edge cases.

Given the above steps, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
