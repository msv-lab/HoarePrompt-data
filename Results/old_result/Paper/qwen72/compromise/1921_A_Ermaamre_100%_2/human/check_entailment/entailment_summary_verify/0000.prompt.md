You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1 2
    
    4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 2
    
    -1 1
    
    1 -1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 -1
    
    45 11
    
    45 39
    
    17 11
    
    17 39

Output

    9
    4
    784

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a series of test cases from the user input. Each test case consists of four tuples representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. For each test case, the function calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. It then prints the area of the square, which is the side length squared. The function does not return any value; it only prints the areas of the squares for each test case. The variable `t` (number of test cases) remains unchanged, and the list of test cases is not stored or modified. The variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are overwritten in each iteration, and their final values will be those from the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input coordinates are not in the correct order. For example, if the input coordinates are:

```
3
1 2
1 5
4 5
4 2
```

The program will still output 9, which is correct for this case. However, if the input coordinates are:

```
3
1 2
4 5
1 5
4 2
```

The program will still output 9, but this is incorrect because the coordinates are not in the correct order. The correct area should be 9, but the program's logic assumes that the coordinates are in a specific order, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The program should first identify the correct pairs of coordinates that form the sides of the square before calculating the area.
