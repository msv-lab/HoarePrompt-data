Output State: **`s` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` is the first integer value from the input, `v` is the second integer value from the input, `f` is the third integer value from the input, `a` is equal to `2 * f`, `k < int(input())`, `n` is assigned an integer value from the input, `m` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `k` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated by adding `f` to its current value.
- Initially, `a` was equal to `f`.
- After executing `a += f`, `a` becomes `2 * f`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
