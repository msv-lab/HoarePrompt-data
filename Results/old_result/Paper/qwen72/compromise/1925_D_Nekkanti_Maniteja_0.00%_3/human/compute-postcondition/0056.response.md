Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new integer values from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is 0, `u`, `v`, and `f` are assigned new integer values from the input, `a` is `f`, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `m` must be greater than 0**

Explanation: The value of `a` is incremented by the value of `f`, so the new value of `a` is `f`. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `m` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
