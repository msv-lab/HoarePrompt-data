Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, for each test case, n, m, and k are integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
    s = 0
    a = 0
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
        a += f
    for i in range(k):
        s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
    print(s % M)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `u` and `v` are assigned integer values from the input, `f` is assigned an integer value from the input, `a` is increased by the sum of all `f` values from the input, `s` is updated to `s + c * (k-1) * c * m + c * a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is updated to `c * c * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`, `i` is `k-1`, `k` is a new integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is a new integer greater than or equal to 3, `u` is the last integer value from the input, `v` is the last integer value from the input, `f` is the last integer value from the input, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values from the input, `n` is assigned a new integer value from the input, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `M` is 1000000007, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is the input integer, `s` is the sum of `c * i * c * m + c * a` for all `i` from 0 to `k-1` modulo `M`, `i` is `k-1`, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over `m` iterations, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
