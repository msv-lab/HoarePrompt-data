Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over `m` iterations, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * 2 * c * m + c * a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- `i` is 2, so `c * i * c * m` becomes `c * 2 * c * m`.
- `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over `m` iterations, so `c * a` remains as `c * a`.
- Therefore, `s` is updated to `s + c * 2 * c * m + c * a`.
- All other variables (`M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, `c`) remain unchanged.
