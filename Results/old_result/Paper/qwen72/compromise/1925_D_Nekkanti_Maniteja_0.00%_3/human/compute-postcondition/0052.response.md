Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new integer values from the input, `s` is 0, `i` is `k`, `u` is the last integer value from the input, `v` is the last integer value from the input, `f` is the last integer value from the input, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values from the input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `s` is reset to 0.
- All other variables (`M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `f`, `a`, and `c`) retain their previous values or expressions as described in the initial state.
