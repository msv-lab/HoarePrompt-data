To determine what will be printed by the `print(s % M)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the formula step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `M` is a constant integer value: \( M = 1000000007 \).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `u` is an input integer.
   - `v` is an input integer.
   - `f` is an input integer.
   - `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided as input over `m` iterations.
   - `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( n \times (n - 1) \) modulo \( M \).

2. **Formula for `s`:**
   - `s` is the sum of \( c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \) modulo \( M \).

3. **Breaking Down the Formula:**
   - For each \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \), the term \( c \times i \times c \times m + c \times a \) is computed.
   - This term simplifies to \( c^2 \times i \times m + c \times a \).
   - The sum of these terms for all \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \) is then taken modulo \( M \).

4. **Summing the Terms:**
   - The sum of \( c^2 \times i \times m \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \) can be written as:
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} c^2 \times i \times m = c^2 \times m \times \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i
     \]
   - The sum of the first \( k-1 \) integers is:
     \[
     \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} i = \frac{(k-1) \times k}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum of \( c^2 \times i \times m \) is:
     \[
     c^2 \times m \times \frac{(k-1) \times k}{2}
     \]
   - The sum of \( c \times a \) for \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \) is:
     \[
     k \times c \times a
     \]

5. **Combining the Terms:**
   - The total sum \( s \) is:
     \[
     s = \left( c^2 \times m \times \frac{(k-1) \times k}{2} + k \times c \times a \right) \mod M
     \]

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(s % M)` statement will print the value of \( s \) modulo \( M \).

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `u`, `v`, and the `f` values over `m` iterations are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the given formula and the initial state, the print statement will output the calculated value of `s` modulo \( M \).

Output: **s % M (where s is the sum of \( c^2 \times i \times m + c \times a \) for all \( i \) from 0 to \( k-1 \) modulo \( M \), and \( c \) is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( n \times (n - 1) \) modulo \( M \))**
