Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new integer values from the input, `s` is `c * c * m * (k-1) * k // 2 + c * a * k`, `i` is `k`, `u` is the last integer value from the input, `v` is the last integer value from the input, `f` is the last integer value from the input, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values from the input, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `c` is updated to the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- The values of `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `f`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M` is calculated using the `pow` function with the third argument as `M`. This value is then assigned to `c`.
