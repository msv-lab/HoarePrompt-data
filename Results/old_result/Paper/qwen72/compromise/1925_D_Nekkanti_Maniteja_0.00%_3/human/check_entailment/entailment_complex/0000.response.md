### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Cases Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which are the number of children, the number of friend pairs, and the number of excursions, respectively.

2. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The function sets `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow and ensure the result fits within standard integer types.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(n \times (n - 1)\) modulo \(M\). This is correct because the probability of choosing any specific pair of children is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\), and the multiplicative inverse of \(n(n-1)\) modulo \(M\) is used to represent this probability in modular arithmetic.

3. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The function initializes `a` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs.
   - It reads `m` lines of input, each containing `u`, `v`, and `f`, and correctly accumulates the sum of `f` values in `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `s` to 0, which will store the final accumulated expected value.
   - It iterates `k` times, each time adding to `s` the value `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in the friendship value of a pair chosen in the i-th excursion, considering the probability of choosing any pair and the number of friend pairs.
     - `c * a` represents the expected contribution of the initial friendship values to the total sum.
   - However, there is a logical error in the expected value calculation. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be calculated as the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values for each excursion.

5. **Correct Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left( \frac{a + i \cdot m}{\binom{n}{2}} \right)
     \]
   - This can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k-1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - The function should calculate this value and then take the result modulo \(M\).

6. **Current Implementation**:
   - The current implementation incorrectly calculates the expected value by using `c * i * c * m + c * a` in each iteration, which does not correctly represent the expected increase in friendship values.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The function's current implementation does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all excursions. The expected value calculation should be adjusted to correctly reflect the mathematical formula for the expected value.
