### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the program's logic for updating the sum `s`. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair of friends increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions if they are chosen in a given excursion.
   - The expected value for each excursion should be calculated and then summed up.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program initializes `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
   - It initializes `a` as the sum of all initial friendship values.
   - It iterates over `k` excursions and updates `s` using the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the expected value for each excursion.
   - The term `c * i * c * m` is particularly problematic. It seems to be an attempt to account for the increase in friendship values, but it does not align with the problem's requirements.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the expected value for each excursion and sum these values.

4. **Correct Calculation**:
   - For each excursion, the expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated as follows:
     - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is `1 / (n * (n - 1) // 2)`.
     - The expected value for the first excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values multiplied by the probability of choosing a pair of friends.
     - For subsequent excursions, the expected value should account for the increased friendship values of pairs that were chosen in previous excursions.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     3 1 2
     1 2 1
     ```
   - **First Excursion**:
     - Probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) is `1 / 3`.
     - Expected friendship value for the first excursion is `1 * (1 / 3) = 1 / 3`.

   - **Second Excursion**:
     - If the pair (1, 2) was chosen in the first excursion, its friendship value becomes 2.
     - If the pair (1, 2) was not chosen in the first excursion, its friendship value remains 1.
     - Expected friendship value for the second excursion is `(1 * (2 / 3) + 2 * (1 / 3)) = 4 / 3`.

   - The total expected value for both excursions is:
     ```
     (1 / 3) + (4 / 3) = 5 / 3
     ```

   - The program's output for this input is incorrect because it uses the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, which does not correctly compute the expected value.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
