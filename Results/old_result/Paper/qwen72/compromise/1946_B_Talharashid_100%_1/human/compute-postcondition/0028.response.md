The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `int(input())` must still be greater than 0 after this increment.

State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space, `c` is the cumulative sum of the positive elements in `l` up to the last element processed, `maxi` is the maximum value between the previous `maxi` and the current `c`.**
