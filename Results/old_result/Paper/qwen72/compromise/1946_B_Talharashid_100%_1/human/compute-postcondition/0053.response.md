Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space, `c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` that are contiguous, and `maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous non-negative elements in `l`.**

### Explanation:
- **`int(input())` is greater than 0**: This condition remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
- **`i` is 1**: This variable is not modified within the loop, so it remains 1.
- **`n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space**: These variables are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- **`l` is a list of integers from the new input split by a space**: This list is iterated over, but not modified within the loop, so it remains unchanged.
- **`c` is the sum of the non-negative elements of `l` that are contiguous**: The variable `c` is used to keep track of the sum of the current contiguous sequence of non-negative elements. If a negative element is encountered and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of that negative element, `c` is reset to 0.
- **`maxi` is the maximum sum of any contiguous non-negative elements in `l`**: The variable `maxi` keeps track of the maximum sum of any contiguous sequence of non-negative elements encountered during the loop. This value is updated whenever a new maximum is found.
