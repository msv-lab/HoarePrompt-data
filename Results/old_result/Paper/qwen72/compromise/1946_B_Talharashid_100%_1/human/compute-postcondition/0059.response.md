Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a new list of integers from the new input split by a space, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of the previous `maxi` and the current `c`**

Explanation:
- `c` is set to 0.
- The values of `int(input())`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.
- The previous value of `c` (which was the sum of the non-negative elements of the new `l` that are contiguous) is now 0.
- `maxi` remains the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `c` (which is 0).
