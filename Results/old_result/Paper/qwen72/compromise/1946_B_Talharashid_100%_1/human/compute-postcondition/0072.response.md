Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `k` are the integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `c + ele`, and `maxi` remains the maximum of `ele` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`.
- If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` remains 0, and `maxi` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `c` is updated to `c + ele`.
- The value of `maxi` is not affected by this code snippet, so it remains the maximum of `ele` and 0.
