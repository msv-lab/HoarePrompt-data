Output State: **`int(input())` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers from the input split by a space, `l` is a list of integers from the input split by a space that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `c` and `maxi` remain 0 if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`. Since `c` is set to 0 in the code snippet, this condition is met, and `maxi` remains 0.
- The values of `int(input())`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` are not changed by the code snippet.
- Therefore, the output state reflects the initial state with the addition that `c` is explicitly set to 0.
