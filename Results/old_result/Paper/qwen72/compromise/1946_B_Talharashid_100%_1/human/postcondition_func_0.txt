The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads the length of an array `n` and the number of operations `k`, followed by the array `a` itself. It then calculates the maximum sum of contiguous non-negative elements in the array, considering the reset condition when a negative element with an absolute value greater than or equal to the current sum is encountered. Finally, it prints the result of the formula `(2
