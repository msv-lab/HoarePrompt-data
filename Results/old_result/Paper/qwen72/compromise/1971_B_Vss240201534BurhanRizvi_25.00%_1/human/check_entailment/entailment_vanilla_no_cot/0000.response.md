Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Rearrangement**: It uses `random.sample` to shuffle the characters of the string `s` to form a new string `s2`.
3. **Comparison and Output**: It checks if the new string `s2` is different from the original string `s`. If they are different, it prints "Yes" followed by the new string `s2`. If they are the same, it prints "No".

The program meets the requirements of the problem statement:
- It outputs "YES" and a valid rearranged string if a different string can be formed.
- It outputs "NO" if no different string can be formed.

The use of `random.sample` ensures that the characters are shuffled, and the comparison `s != s2` ensures that the new string is different from the original. Given the constraints (string length at most 10 and up to 1000 test cases), the program is efficient and should work correctly for the given inputs.
