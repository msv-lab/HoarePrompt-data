You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and k is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should either be called in a loop or modified to accept a list of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n - 1)
        
    #State: The loop will print either `1` or `n - 1` for each test case, depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` will be unchanged after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have \( n \) islands, and initially, every pair of islands is connected by a bridge.
   - Dominater can destroy up to \( k \) bridges to minimize the number of islands Everule can visit.
   - We need to find the minimum number of islands (including island 1) that Everule can visit after Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

2. **Initial Observations:**
   - If \( k \geq n - 1 \), Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, making it impossible for Everule to visit any other island. Hence, Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If \( k < n - 1 \), Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1. Therefore, Everule will still be able to visit at least \( n - 1 \) islands, including island 1.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( k \geq n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.
   - If \( k < n - 1 \), it prints \( n - 1 \), indicating that Everule can visit \( n - 1 \) islands, including island 1.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k \geq n - 1 \) by printing 1.
   - However, the program incorrectly handles the case where \( k < n - 1 \). It should print \( n \) instead of \( n - 1 \) because Everule can still visit all \( n \) islands, including island 1, even if some bridges are destroyed.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it prints \( n - 1 \) when \( k < n - 1 \), which is not the correct minimum number of islands Everule can visit.

Correctness: **False**
