The function `func` should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of islands, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, with the constraint 0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2. The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, either by being called in a loop or by accepting a list of test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). The function returns the result of some computation based on these parameters, which could vary depending on the specific test case being handled.**
