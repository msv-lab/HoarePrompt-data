Output State: **The function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should either be called in a loop or modified to accept a list of test cases. `t` is an input integer.**
