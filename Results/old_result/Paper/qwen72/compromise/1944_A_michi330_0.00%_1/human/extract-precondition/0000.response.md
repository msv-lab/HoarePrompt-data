Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and k is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, so it should either be called in a loop or modified to accept a list of test cases.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def func(n, k):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2.**
