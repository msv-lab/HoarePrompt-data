The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` from input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 1000`, and prints the result of the integer division of `x` by 2. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `x` and `y` are not retained.
