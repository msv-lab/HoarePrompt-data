The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list**
