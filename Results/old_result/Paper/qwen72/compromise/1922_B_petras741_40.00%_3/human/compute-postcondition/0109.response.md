Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln` (the number of iterations completed), `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of the occurrences of all integers in `eta`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of occurrences of each integer in `eta` taken 3 at a time plus the sum of the combinations of occurrences of each integer in `eta` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the cumulative sum of occurrences of all previous integers in `eta` if `eta_ln` is greater than 1.***
