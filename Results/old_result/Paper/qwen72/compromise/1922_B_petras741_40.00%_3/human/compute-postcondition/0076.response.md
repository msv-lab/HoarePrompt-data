Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list containing the integers 0 and 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `eta`.
- Since `eta` initially contains the integer 0 (as per the initial state), after appending `j`, `eta` now contains the integers 0 and 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `q[j]` is greater than 0 is still valid, so `eta` was initially a list containing the integer 0, and now it contains 0 and 1.
