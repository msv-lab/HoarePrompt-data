The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `j` is 0.
- `eta` is an empty list if `q[0]` is not greater than 0. If `q[0]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing `[0]`.

At the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` is 1.
- `n` remains the same, so `n` is still greater than or equal to 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is now 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 (so that `n + 1` is greater than 1).

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, `eta` is an empty list if `q[0]` is not greater than 0. If `q[0]` is greater than 0, `eta` is a list containing `[0]`.**
