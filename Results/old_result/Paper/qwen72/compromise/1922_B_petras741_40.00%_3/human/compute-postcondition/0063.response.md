The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `j` is not explicitly given, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function at the start of the loop.

Given that `n` is an input integer, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `j` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0, `j` is 0**
