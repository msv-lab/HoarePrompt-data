Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is 3, `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 3, `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[1]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[2]` in the list `w`, `res` is increased by `q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding `q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho` to its current value.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `res` after this update depends on the values of `q[eta[3]]` and `rho`, but the formula for the update is provided in the output state.
