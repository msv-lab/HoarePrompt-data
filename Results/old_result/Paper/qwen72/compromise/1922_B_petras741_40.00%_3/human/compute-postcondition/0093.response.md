Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta` and must be greater than 1, `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w` plus the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[1]` in the list `w`, `res` is updated to `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) * (q[eta[1]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[1]] * (q[eta[1]] - 1) // 2 * (rho - q[eta[1]])`, and `j` is greater than 1000, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
