Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, `rho` is incremented by `q[eta[3]]`, `res` is incremented by `q[eta[2]] * (q[eta[2]] - 1) // 2 * rho + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) * (q[eta[3]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[3]] * (q[eta[3]] - 1) // 2 * rho`. If `j` > 1000, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
