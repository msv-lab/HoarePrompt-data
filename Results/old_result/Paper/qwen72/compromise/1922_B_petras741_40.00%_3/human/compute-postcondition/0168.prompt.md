Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each a_i represents the exponent of the length of the i-th stick, which is 2^{a_i}. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user. `buffer` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    w = [int(k) for k in input().split()]
    if n >= 3:
        q = {}
        q = [(0) for j in range(n + 1)]
        for j in range(n):
            q[w[j]] += 1
        eta = []
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if q[j] > 0:
                eta.append(j)
        eta_ln = len(eta)
        rho = q[eta[0]]
        if eta_ln == 1:
            print(n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) // 6)
        else:
            res = q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6
            for j in range(1, eta_ln):
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6
                res += q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho
                rho += q[eta[j]]
                if j > 1000:
                    break
            print(res)
    else:
        print(0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers derived from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1. `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of the values of `q` at the indices `eta[0]` to `eta[eta_ln - 1]`, and `res` is the sum of the values of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) * (q[eta[j]] - 2) // 6` for each `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of the values of `q[eta[j]] * (q[eta[j]] - 1) // 2 * rho` for each `j` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `eta_ln` is greater than 1001, the loop breaks after the 1000th iteration. If `n` is less than 3, no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers derived from the input. If `n` is less than 3, the program retains the initial state of `t`, `i`, `buffer`, `n`, and `w`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln` (the number of iterations completed), `eta` is a list containing all integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is the number of occurrences of the integer `eta[0]` in the list `w` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `rho` is the sum of the occurrences of all integers in `eta`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of occurrences of each integer in `eta` taken 3 at a time plus the sum of the combinations of occurrences of each integer in `eta` taken 2 at a time multiplied by the cumulative sum of occurrences of all previous integers in `eta` if `eta_ln` is greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers derived from the input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `j` is `n` if `eta_ln` is 1, otherwise `j` is `eta_ln - 1`. `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, and `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`. Otherwise, `rho` is the sum of `q[eta[i]]` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1`, and `res` is the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) * (q[eta[i]] - 2) // 6` for all `i` from 0 to `eta_ln - 1` plus the sum of `q[eta[i]] * (q[eta[i]] - 1) // 2 * (sum of q[eta[k]] for all k from 0 to i-1)` for all `i` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`. If `j` is greater than 1000, the loop breaks. If `n` is less than 3, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
