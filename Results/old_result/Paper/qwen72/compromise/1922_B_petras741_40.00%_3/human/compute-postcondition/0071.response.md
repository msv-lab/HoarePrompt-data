The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n + 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be at least 0. Before the loop starts, `j` is `n - 1`, but for the loop to execute, `j` must be set to 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `k` (where `k` is an integer from the list `w`) is equal to the number of occurrences of `k` in `w`, `j` is 0, `eta` is an empty list**
