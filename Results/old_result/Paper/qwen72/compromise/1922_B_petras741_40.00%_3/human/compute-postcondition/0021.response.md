Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers derived from the input, `q` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where the value at each index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range 0 to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 1, `eta` is a list containing the integer 1.**

Explanation: The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `eta`. Since `q[j]` (where `j` is 1) is greater than 0 (as per the precondition), `eta` now contains the integer 0 and the integer 1. However, the precondition already states that `eta` contains the integer 0, so the updated state is that `eta` now contains the integer 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
