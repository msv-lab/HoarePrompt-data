Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is the number of times 'L' appears in `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros. If the last character of `t` is 'L', `k` is set to `a[l - 1] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 2`, and `q2` is set to `l`. If the last character of `t` is not 'L', `k` is set to `a[l] % m`, `q1` is set to `l - 1`, and `q2` is set to `l + 1`.**
