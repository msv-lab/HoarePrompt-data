### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not generate a string that ensures all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are present. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Function Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters from the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - For example, if `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the function generates the string `abcbac`.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The task requires generating a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the possible strings of length 2 are: `aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`.

3. **Evaluation of the Generated String**:
   - The string `abcbac` generated by the function for `n = 2` and `k = 3`:
     - `aa`: Not a subsequence.
     - `ab`: Subsequence (e.g., `ab` in `abcbac`).
     - `ac`: Subsequence (e.g., `ac` in `abcbac`).
     - `ba`: Subsequence (e.g., `ba` in `abcbac`).
     - `bb`: Not a subsequence.
     - `bc`: Subsequence (e.g., `bc` in `abcbac`).
     - `ca`: Subsequence (e.g., `ca` in `abcbac`).
     - `cb`: Subsequence (e.g., `cb` in `abcbac`).
     - `cc`: Not a subsequence.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The string `abcbac` does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets.
   - Specifically, `aa` and `bb` are missing as subsequences.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not generate a string that ensures all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are present. The function `func_1` needs to be revised to meet the problem requirements.
