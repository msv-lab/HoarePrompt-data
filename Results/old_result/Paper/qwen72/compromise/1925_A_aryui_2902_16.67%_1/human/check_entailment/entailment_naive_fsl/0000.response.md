Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` generates a string by repeating the first `k` lowercase English alphabets `n` times. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the generated string `s`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `k = 3`:
- The program generates the string `abcbac`.
- However, the string `cb` is not a subsequence of `abcbac`.

To meet the problem requirements, the generated string `s` must contain all possible subsequences of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The current implementation fails to do so in many cases, making it incorrect.
