Reasoning:
The program provided is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The function `func` reads the input for each test case but does not perform any logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after performing the allowed operations. Instead, it simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct output based on the problem statement.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Counting the frequency of each card number.
2. Determining how many operations can be performed on each group of cards with the same number.
3. Calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be exchanged further.

The program fails to implement these steps and, therefore, does not produce the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **False**
