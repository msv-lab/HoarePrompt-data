Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described.

To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the frequency of each card number and how many operations you can perform to reduce the number of cards. The correct solution involves calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k` cards with the same number.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        from collections import Counter
        freq = Counter(l)
        
        min_cards_left = min((count % k) + (1 if count % k != 0 else 0) for count in freq.values())
        
        print(min_cards_left)

func()
```

Explanation:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list of card numbers `l`.
2. **Frequency Calculation**: It uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each card number.
3. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: For each unique card number, it calculates the remainder when the count of that number is divided by `k`. If the remainder is not zero, it means there are some cards left that cannot form a complete group of `k` cards. The minimum number of cards left is the smallest such remainder plus one (if the remainder is not zero) to account for the fact that you can't exchange a partial group of cards.

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.
