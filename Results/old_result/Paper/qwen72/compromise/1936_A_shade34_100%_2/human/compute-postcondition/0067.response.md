Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is 1, `mak` is `n` if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 4 elements.**

Explanation:
- The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not change the values of any variables. It simply ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal immediately.
- All other variables retain their initial values as specified in the initial state.
