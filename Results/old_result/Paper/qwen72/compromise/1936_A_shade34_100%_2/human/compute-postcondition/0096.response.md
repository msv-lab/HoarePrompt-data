Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0.
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is 0.
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is an empty list.

Given this information, let's analyze the `print` statement:

```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

1. `'?'` is a string literal and will be printed as is.
2. `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. Since `i` starts at 0 and no user input has been specified in the initial state, `mak` is 0.
3. `mak2` is also the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. Similarly, since no user input has been specified, `mak2` is 0.
4. `i` is explicitly stated to be 0.
5. `mak2` is again 0, as previously determined.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output:

Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
