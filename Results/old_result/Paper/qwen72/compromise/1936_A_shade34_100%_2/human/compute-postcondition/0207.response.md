Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
   - `pans` is a list with at least `n+1` elements.
   - If the user input is `>`, then `mak` is set to `n-1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output a question mark followed by four elements from the `pans` list.
   - The indices used to access the `pans` list are `mak` and `i`.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `mak` is either `mak2` (if the user input was `<`) or `n-1` (if the user input was `>`).

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - **Scenario 1: User input is `<`**
     - `mak` is set to `mak2`.
     - The print statement will output: `? pans[mak2] pans[mak2] pans[n] pans[n]`.
   - **Scenario 2: User input is `>`**
     - `mak` is set to `n-1`.
     - The print statement will output: `? pans[n-1] pans[n-1] pans[n] pans[n]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `pans[mak2]` and `pans[n]` depend on the specific values in the `pans` list, we can only describe them in terms of their indices.
   - If the user input is `<`, the output will be: `? pans[mak2] pans[mak2] pans[n] pans[n]`.
   - If the user input is `>`, the output will be: `? pans[n-1] pans[n-1] pans[n] pans[n]`.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[n] pans[n] (where mak is either mak2 if the user input was <, or n-1 if the user input was >, and n is the input positive integer)**
