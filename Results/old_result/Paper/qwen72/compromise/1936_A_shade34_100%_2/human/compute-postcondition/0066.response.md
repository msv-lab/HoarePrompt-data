Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is the input positive integer.
- `i` is `n`.
- `mak` is `n` if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<` and must have at least 4 elements.
- `i` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`pans` List**: 
   - `pans` is a list containing values of `i` where the user input was `=` or `<`.
   - It is guaranteed to have at least 4 elements.

2. **`mak` Variable**:
   - `mak` is `n` if the user input was `>` at any point.
   - If the user input was never `>`, `mak` remains 0.

3. **`i` Variable**:
   - `i` is set to 1.

### Values in the Print Statement:
- `pans[mak]`: 
  - If `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
  - If `mak` is `n`, `pans[mak]` is `pans[n]`.

- `pans[i]`: 
  - Since `i` is 1, `pans[i]` is `pans[1]`.

### Final Output:
- The print statement will output the following:
  - `'?'` (a literal question mark).
  - `pans[mak]` (which is either `pans[0]` or `pans[n]` depending on the value of `mak`).
  - `pans[mak]` (same as above).
  - `pans[1]` (the second element of the `pans` list).
  - `pans[1]` (the same as above).

### Conclusion:
- If `mak` is 0, the output will be:
  - `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[1] pans[1]`
- If `mak` is `n`, the output will be:
  - `? pans[n] pans[n] pans[1] pans[1]`

Since we don't know the exact value of `n` or the contents of `pans`, we can only describe the output in terms of the indices.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[1] pans[1] (where mak is 0 if the user input was never >, otherwise mak is n, and pans is a list containing values of i for which the user input was = or <)**
