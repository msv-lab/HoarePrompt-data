Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, if the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.** 

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call does not affect the values of any variables. It only ensures that any buffered output is written immediately to the console or output stream. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
