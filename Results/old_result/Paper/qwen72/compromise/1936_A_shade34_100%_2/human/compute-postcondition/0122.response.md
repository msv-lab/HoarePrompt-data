The code snippet `pans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. Given the initial state, let's determine the updated state:

- `_` remains 0.
- `n` remains the new input positive integer (greater than 1).
- `i` remains 2.
- `mak` remains the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` remains the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `s` remains the new input string.
- `pans` is updated by appending the value of `i` (which is 2) to the existing list.

Given the initial conditions:
- If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`.
- If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`.
- For any other value of `s`, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.

After executing `pans.append(i)`, the value of `pans` will be:
- `[1, 2]` if `s` is `<` or `=`.
- `[0, 2]` if `s` is `<` and initially `pans` was `[0]`.
- `[2]` if `s` is any other value and `pans` was initially an empty list.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 2, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `s` is the new input string, `pans` is `[1, 2]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, `pans` is `[0, 2]` if `s` is `<` and initially `pans` was `[0]`, `pans` is `[2]` if `s` is any other value and `pans` was initially an empty list.**
