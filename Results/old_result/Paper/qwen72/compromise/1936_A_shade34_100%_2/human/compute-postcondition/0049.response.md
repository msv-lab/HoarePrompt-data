Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is the new string input by the user, `pans` is `[1, 2]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is `[1, 2]`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `pans`. Since `pans` was initially `[1]` regardless of the value of `s`, after appending `i`, `pans` becomes `[1, 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
