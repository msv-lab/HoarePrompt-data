Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `mak` is 1, `mak2` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[0]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`. Otherwise, `pans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to the value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
