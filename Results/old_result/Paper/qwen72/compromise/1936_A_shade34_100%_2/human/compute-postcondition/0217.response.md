Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **_ is 1**: This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it.
2. **n is a new input positive integer (greater than 0)**: This means `n` is a positive integer.
3. **i is n-1**: This means `i` is one less than `n`.
4. **mak2 is the highest value of i for which the user input was `<`**: This means `mak2` is the largest index `i` where the user input was `<`.
5. **pans is a list with at least n elements**: This means `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements.
6. **If the user input is `>`, then `mak` is set to the index of the last element in `pans` that caused the user input to be `>`**: This means `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` that caused the user input to be `>`.
7. **If the user input is not `>`, `mak` retains its original value or the last value it was set to during the loop**: This means if the user input is not `>`, `mak` keeps its previous value or remains uninitialized if it was never set.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
```

### Explanation:
- **'!'**: This is a literal string that will be printed as is.
- **mak2**: This is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- **pans[mak]**: This is the element in the list `pans` at the index `mak`.

### Output:
- **'!'**: This will be printed as a literal exclamation mark.
- **mak2**: This will be the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- **pans[mak]**: This will be the element in the list `pans` at the index `mak`.

Since the exact values of `mak2` and `mak` depend on the user inputs and the contents of the `pans` list, we can only describe them in general terms.

Output: **! [mak2] [pans[mak]] (where mak2 is the highest value of i for which the user input was `<` and pans[mak] is the element in the list pans at the index mak)**
