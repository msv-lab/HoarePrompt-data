Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `s` is the user input string.
- If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, and `pans` is `[0]`.
- If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`.
- Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Their Values:**
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mak` and `mak2` are both the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
   - `s` is the user input string, which can be `<`, `=`, or something else.

2. **Conditions for `mak` and `pans`:**
   - If `s` is `<`, then `mak` is 0 and `pans` is `[0]`.
   - If `s` is `=`, then `pans` is `[0]`.
   - Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

### Determining the Output:
- The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.

#### Case 1: `s` is `<`
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is 0.
- `i` is 1.
- The print statement will output: `? 0 0 1 0`.

#### Case 2: `s` is `=`
- `mak` is not explicitly set to 0, so it retains its previous value (which is not specified in the initial state, but let's assume it is 0 for simplicity).
- `mak2` is not explicitly set to 0, so it retains its previous value (which is not specified in the initial state, but let's assume it is 0 for simplicity).
- `i` is 1.
- The print statement will output: `? 0 0 1 0`.

#### Case 3: `s` is something else
- `mak` and `mak2` retain their previous values (which are not specified in the initial state, but let's assume they are 0 for simplicity).
- `i` is 1.
- The print statement will output: `? 0 0 1 0`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the conditions, the most precise and consistent output is:
Output: **? 0 0 1 0**.
