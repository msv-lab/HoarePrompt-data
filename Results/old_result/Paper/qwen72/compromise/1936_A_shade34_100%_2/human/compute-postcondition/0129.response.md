Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal immediately, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the program remains unchanged except for the flushing of the output buffer.
