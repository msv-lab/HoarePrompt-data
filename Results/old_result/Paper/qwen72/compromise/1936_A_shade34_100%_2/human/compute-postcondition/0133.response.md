To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `_` is 0
- `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0)
- `i` is 1
- `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`
- `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.
- The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(pans)`.

### Current State:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
- `pans` is a list containing at least 2 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.

### Adjusting the State:
- To execute the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.
- For the loop to continue, `len(pans)` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 0), `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>`, otherwise `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing at least 3 values of `i` for which the user input was `=`**
