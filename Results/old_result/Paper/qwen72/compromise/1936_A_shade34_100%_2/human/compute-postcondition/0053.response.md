Output State: **_ is 0, `n` is the input positive integer, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`.** 

Explanation: The value of `mak` is set to 0, overriding its previous value. The other variables (`_`, `n`, `i`, `mak2`, and `pans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
