Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 0 (though its exact value is not specified)
- `i` is 0
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is 0
- `pans` is an empty list

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's break down the values being printed:
- `'?'` is a string literal and will be printed as is.
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `mak2` is 0 again

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
