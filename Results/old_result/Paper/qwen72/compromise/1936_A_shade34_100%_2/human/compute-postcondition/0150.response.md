Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it for now).
- `n` is a new input positive integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak`, `i`, and `i`.
- `mak` is 0.
- `i` is 1.

### Output Calculation:
- The string `'?'` will be printed first.
- The value of `mak` (which is 0) will be printed twice.
- The value of `i` (which is 1) will be printed twice.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
