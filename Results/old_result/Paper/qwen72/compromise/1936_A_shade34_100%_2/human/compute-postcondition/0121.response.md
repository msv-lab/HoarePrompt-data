Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 2 and `pans` is `[2]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[2]`. For any other value of `s`, `pans` is `[2]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains `[0]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. `s` is the new input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `pans = [i]` assigns the list containing the current value of `i` (which is 2) to `pans`.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `pans` is now `[2]`.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
