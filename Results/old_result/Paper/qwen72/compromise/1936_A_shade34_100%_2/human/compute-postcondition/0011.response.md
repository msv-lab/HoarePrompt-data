The `sys.stdout.flush()` function flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `stdout` is actually displayed immediately. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables in the program.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, if the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
