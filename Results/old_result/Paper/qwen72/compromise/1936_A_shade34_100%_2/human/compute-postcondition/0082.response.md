The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is the last value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was `=` or `<`. If the user input is `<`, then `mak` is updated to 1.**
