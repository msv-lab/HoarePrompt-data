Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `_` is 0.
- `n` is a new input positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
- `pans` is an empty list.
- `s` is the user input string.
  - If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, and `pans` is `[0]`.
  - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[0]`.
  - Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak` and `mak2`**:
   - Both `mak` and `mak2` are described as the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`.
   - However, if `s` is `<`, `mak` is explicitly set to 0.
   - There is no additional information provided about `mak2` in the initial state, so it is reasonable to assume that `mak2` is also 0 if `s` is `<`.

2. **`i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly set to 1.

3. **`pans`**:
   - `pans` is an empty list unless `s` is `<` or `=`, in which case it is `[0]`.

### Possible Scenarios:
- **If `s` is `<`**:
  - `mak` is 0.
  - `mak2` is 0 (since there is no other information, we assume it follows the same logic as `mak`).
  - `i` is 1.
  - `pans` is `[0]`.

- **If `s` is `=`**:
  - `mak` is not explicitly set, but since `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, and `s` is `=`, `mak` should be 0.
  - `mak2` is also 0 for the same reason.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `pans` is `[0]`.

- **If `s` is anything else**:
  - `mak` is not explicitly set, but it would be 0 if no `<` input has been received.
  - `mak2` is also 0 for the same reason.
  - `i` is 1.
  - `pans` remains an empty list.

### Conclusion:
In all scenarios, the values of `mak` and `mak2` are 0, and `i` is 1. Therefore, the print statement will always output:

Output: **? 0 0 1 0**
