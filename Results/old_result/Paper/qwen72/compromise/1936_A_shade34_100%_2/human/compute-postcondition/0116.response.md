The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a new input positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is the new input positive integer (greater than 1), `i` is 2, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`, `mak2` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was `<`. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`. For any other value of `s`, `pans` is `[0]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list.**
