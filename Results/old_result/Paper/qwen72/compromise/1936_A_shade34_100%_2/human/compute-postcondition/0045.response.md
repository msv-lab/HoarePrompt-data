The `sys.stdout.flush()` function flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all data written to `sys.stdout` is immediately written to the terminal or console. This operation does not modify any of the variables in the current state.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is the string input by the user. If `s` is `<`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` is `[1]`. If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `pans` is `[1]`.**
