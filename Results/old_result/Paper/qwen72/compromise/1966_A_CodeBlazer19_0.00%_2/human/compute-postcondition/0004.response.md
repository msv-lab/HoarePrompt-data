Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. Instead, it reads input from the user multiple times. It first reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `l`. The function then prints `k - 1` for each test case. The initial variables `numbers` and `k` mentioned in the annotations are not used or modified by the function. After the function concludes, the variable `t` is exhausted (decremented to 0), and the variables `n`, `k`, and `l` are updated for each iteration based on the input provided. **
