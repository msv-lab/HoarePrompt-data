Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations as described.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the frequency of each card number and determine how many cards can be removed using the operations. The program should calculate the minimum number of cards that cannot be removed by the given operations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        from collections import Counter
        freq = Counter(l)
        
        min_cards_left = n
        for count in freq.values():
            # Calculate the number of cards left after performing the operation as many times as possible
            cards_left = count % (k - 1)
            if cards_left == 0:
                cards_left = k - 1
            min_cards_left = min(min_cards_left, cards_left)
        
        print(min_cards_left)

func()
```

This program correctly calculates the minimum number of cards left by considering the frequency of each card number and applying the operations as described in the problem statement.
