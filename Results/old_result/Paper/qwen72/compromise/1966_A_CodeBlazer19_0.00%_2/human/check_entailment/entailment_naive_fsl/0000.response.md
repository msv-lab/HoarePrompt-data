Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It simply prints `k - 1` for each test case, which is incorrect. The program should calculate the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the allowed operations.

For example, consider the first test case:
- Input: `5 3` and `4 1 1 4 4`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `2`

However, for the second test case:
- Input: `1 10` and `7`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Actual Output: `9`

The actual output is clearly incorrect. The program does not account for the number of cards with the same number and the operations that can be performed to reduce the number of cards. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
