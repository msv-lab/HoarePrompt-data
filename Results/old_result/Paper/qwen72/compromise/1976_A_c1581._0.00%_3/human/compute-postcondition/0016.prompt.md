You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of 1 to 20 characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in the order they appear.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: `digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in the order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string, or -1 if there are no digits.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: *`digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in the order they appear; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string, or -1 if there are no digits.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: *`digits` is a list containing all the digit characters from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `digits` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letter characters from the `password` string in the order they appear, and `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string, or -1 if there are no digits.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string of 1 to 20 characters (each character being a lowercase Latin letter or a digit). It returns 'NO' in two scenarios and 'YES' in another scenario, but the specific conditions for these scenarios are not provided.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'

Case_3: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
