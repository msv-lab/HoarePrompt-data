Reasoning:

1. **Condition 1: Password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.**
   - The program implicitly checks this condition by using the `isdigit()` method and the `else` block, which only processes lowercase letters. If any character is not a digit or a lowercase letter, it will not be processed, but the program will not fail because it only checks the sorting and order of digits and letters. This is correct.

2. **Condition 2: There should be no digit that comes after a letter.**
   - The program correctly implements this condition by maintaining a `last_digit_index` variable. If a digit is found, it updates this index. If a letter is found after a digit (i.e., `last_digit_index` is not -1), the function returns 'NO'. This is correct.

3. **Condition 3: All digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.**
   - The program checks this by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version. If they are not the same, the function returns 'NO'. This is correct.

4. **Condition 4: All letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order.**
   - The program checks this by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version. If they are not the same, the function returns 'NO'. This is correct.

The annotated code confirms that:
- The `digits` and `letters` lists are correctly populated with the respective characters from the password.
- The `last_digit_index` variable is used to ensure no digit comes after a letter.
- The sorting checks for both `digits` and `letters` are performed correctly.

The program processes the input correctly, handling multiple test cases and ensuring that all the conditions are met for each password. No edge cases or potential issues have been identified that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
