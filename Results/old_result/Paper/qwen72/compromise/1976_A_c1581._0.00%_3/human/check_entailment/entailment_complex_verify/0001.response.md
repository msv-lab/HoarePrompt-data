### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - The program then iterates over each test case, extracting the length `n` and the password string from the list.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for checking if the password meets the given conditions.
   - It initializes two lists: `digits` and `letters` to store the digits and letters in the password, respectively.
   - It iterates over each character in the password:
     - If the character is a digit, it is appended to the `digits` list.
     - If the character is a letter, it is appended to the `letters` list.
   - This part of the function is correct and ensures that all characters are either digits or letters, as required by the problem description.

3. **Checking for Digits After Letters:**
   - The function maintains a variable `last_digit_index` to keep track of the last index where a digit was found.
   - If a letter is found and `last_digit_index` is not `-1`, it means a digit comes after a letter, and the function returns 'NO'.
   - This correctly implements the second condition of the problem.

4. **Checking Sorted Digits:**
   - The function checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing `digits` with `sorted(digits)`.
   - If the digits are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
   - This correctly implements the third condition of the problem.

5. **Checking Sorted Letters:**
   - The function checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing `letters` with `sorted(letters)`.
   - If the letters are not sorted, it returns 'NO'.
   - This correctly implements the fourth condition of the problem.

6. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results of each test case in the `results` list and prints them all at once, separated by newlines.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

### Verification:

- **Condition 1:**
  - The password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
  - This is implicitly handled by the `isdigit` and `isalpha` checks in the `func_1` function. Since the problem description guarantees valid inputs, this condition is always met.

- **Condition 2:**
  - There should be no digit that comes after a letter.
  - The function correctly checks this by maintaining `last_digit_index` and returning 'NO' if a letter is found after a digit.

- **Condition 3:**
  - All digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The function correctly checks this by comparing `digits` with `sorted(digits)`.

- **Condition 4:**
  - All letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - The function correctly checks this by comparing `letters` with `sorted(letters)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements all the conditions specified in the problem description. It handles the input and output as required, and the logic for checking the password strength is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
