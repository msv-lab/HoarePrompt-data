Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the scores `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` for each case.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in case of a win/loss or 2 points in case of a draw).

3. **Draw Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
   \[
   \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
   \]
   This formula is derived from the following logic:
   - The total points scored by all players is `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]`.
   - The maximum number of points that can be scored without any draws is `2 * (number of games)`, where the number of games is the total number of points divided by 2.
   - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` accounts for the scenario where the highest score `v[2]` is more than the sum of the other two scores, which would indicate an impossible situation if there were no draws. This term ensures that the program correctly handles such cases by subtracting the excess points that cannot be explained by wins and losses alone.
   - The result is then divided by 2 to get the number of draws, as each draw contributes 2 points.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints the result for each test case.

The program handles all the given test cases correctly and follows the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
