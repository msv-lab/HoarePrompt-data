Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (since `bx` < `ax`), `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `a` and `x` are input integers, and `a` is not equal to 1. If `a` is 2, `a` is 2. If `a` is not 2, `a` is not equal to 2.***
