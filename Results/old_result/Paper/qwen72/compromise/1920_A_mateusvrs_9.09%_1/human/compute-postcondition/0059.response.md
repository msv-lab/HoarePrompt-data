The code snippet `bx = max(x, bx)` updates the value of `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. Given the initial state:

- `bx` is initially `-1`.
- `x` is an input integer.

The new value of `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and `-1`.

If `x` is greater than `-1`, `bx` will be updated to `x`. Otherwise, `bx` will remain `-1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` must be greater than 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `cx` is an empty set, `tmp` is 0, `a` is 1, `x` is an input integer.**
