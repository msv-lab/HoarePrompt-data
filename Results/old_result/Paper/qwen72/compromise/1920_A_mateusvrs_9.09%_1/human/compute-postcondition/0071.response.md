The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and its current value. The current value of `ax` depends on the value of `a`:

- If `a` is 1 or 2, `ax` is initially 1000000007.
- Otherwise, `ax` is also 1000000007.

Since `ax` is always 1000000007, the new value of `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `x` is less than 1000000007, `ax` will be updated to `x`. If `x` is greater than or equal to 1000000007, `ax` will remain 1000000007.

All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `tmp`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1` if `a` is 1, otherwise -1, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise a set containing the element `x`, `n` is now `n-1`.**
