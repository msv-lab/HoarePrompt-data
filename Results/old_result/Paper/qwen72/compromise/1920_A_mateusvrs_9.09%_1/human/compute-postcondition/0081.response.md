Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n-1`, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and `-1`, `ax` is 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1, `ax` is `min(x, 1000000007)`, and `cx` is an empty set. For any other value of `a`, `bx` is -1, `ax` is 1000000007, and `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.***
