Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`, `a` and `x` are input integers. `bx` is now the maximum of the original `x` and the original `bx`. `n` is now `n - 1`. The new values of `a` and `x` are the integers provided by the user input.**
