Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is greater than 0, `bx` is -1, `tmp` is 0, `a` is an input integer, and `x` is an input integer. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is not 2, `ax` is 1000000007, and `cx` is a set containing the element `x`.***
