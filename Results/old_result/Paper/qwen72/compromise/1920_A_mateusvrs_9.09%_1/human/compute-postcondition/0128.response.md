Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]`, `n` is greater than 0 and is now `n - 1`, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `a` and `x` are updated to the integers provided by the user input, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1 or 2, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of the original `x` and the original `bx`, `cx` is a set containing `{x}`.**

Explanation:
- The code `cx.add(x)` adds the value of `x` to the set `cx`.
- Since `cx` was initially an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, or a set containing `{x}` otherwise, after adding `x`, `cx` now contains `{x}`.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `tmp`, `ax`, `a`, `x`, and `bx`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
