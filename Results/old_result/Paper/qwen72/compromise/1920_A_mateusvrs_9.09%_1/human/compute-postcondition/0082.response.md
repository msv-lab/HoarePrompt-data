Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is 0 (indicating the loop has completed its iterations), `tmp` is 0, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant as they are input values for each iteration, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, and `cx` is a set containing all unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`r`**: Remains a list containing one element which is `1000000008` because `bx` starts at `-1` and `ax` is `1000000007`, so `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` evaluates to `1000000008`.
- **`n`**: Decreases with each iteration until it reaches 0, indicating the loop has completed.
- **`tmp`**: Remains 0 because `cx` is initially empty and no elements are added that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
- **`a` and `x`**: These are input values for each iteration and are not stored or used outside the loop.
- **`bx`**: Updated to the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1.
- **`ax`**: Updated to the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2.
- **`cx`**: Contains all unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3.
