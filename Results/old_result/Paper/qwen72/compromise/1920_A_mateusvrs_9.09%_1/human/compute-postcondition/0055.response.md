Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is either a list containing [0] if `bx` ≥ `ax`, or a list containing one element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` if `bx` < `ax`. `n` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `bx` < `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are within the range `[bx, ax]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `bx` is updated to -1.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `ax`, `cx`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `r` and `tmp` remains the same as in the initial state.
