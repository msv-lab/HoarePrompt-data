Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer, `ax` is not yet defined, `bx` is not yet defined, and `cx` contains the value `x`.**

The value `x` has been added to the set `cx`, making `cx` a set containing the single element `x`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
