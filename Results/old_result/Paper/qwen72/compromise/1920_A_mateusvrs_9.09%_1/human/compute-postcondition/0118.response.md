Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 498, `r` is a list containing `[1000000008, ax - bx + 1 - tmp]` (since `bx` < `ax`), `n` must be greater than 0, `tmp` is 0, `ax` is 1000000007, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing `{x}`, `a` and `x` are input integers. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` is -1 and `cx` contains `{x}`. `n` is now `n - 1`. The new values of `a` and `x` are the integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `r`, `n`, `tmp`, `ax`, `cx`, `bx`) remain unchanged.
- The new values of `a` and `x` are the integers provided by the user input.
