Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is 0, `tmp` is 0, `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing all unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3, and `bx` is less than `ax`.
Code of the loop:
for i in cx:
    if i >= bx and i <= ax:
        tmp += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is 0, `tmp` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` remains 0. `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3, and `bx` is less than `ax`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is 0, `tmp` is 2 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` remains 1. `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3, and `bx` is less than `ax`. `i` is the next value from the set `cx`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 499, `r` is a list containing one element which is `1000000008`, `n` is 0, and `tmp` is 3 if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`; otherwise, `tmp` is 2. `a` and `x` are no longer relevant, `bx` is the maximum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 1, `ax` is the minimum value encountered from the inputs where `a` was 2, `cx` is a set containing at least two unique values encountered from the inputs where `a` was 3, and `bx` is less than `ax`. `i` is the next value from the set `cx`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
