Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `r` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is the first input integer, `x` is the second input integer. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1), and `ax` is `x`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` remains an empty set. Otherwise, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `cx` is a set containing the input integer `x`, and `a` is not equal to 1 or 2.**
