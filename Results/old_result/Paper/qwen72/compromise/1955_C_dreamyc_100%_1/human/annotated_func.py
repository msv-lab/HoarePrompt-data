#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    if (k >= sum(nums)) :
        return n
        #The program returns the positive integer `n`, which represents the number of elements in the list `nums`.
    #State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9. Additionally, k is less than the sum of the elements in nums.

    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `nums` remains unchanged, `a` remains the ceiling of `k / 2`, `b` remains the integer division of `k` by 2, `ans` is the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `a` plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `b` when the list is traversed in reverse, but each element is counted at most once. `s_a` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and `s_b` is the sum of the elements in `nums` (since both `s_a` and `s_b` will have summed the entire list after the loop).
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the ceiling of `k / 2` (`a`) plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the integer division of `k` by 2 (`b`), where each element is counted at most once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns either `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`, or it returns the number of elements in `nums` that contribute to the sum of the first `a` elements and the sum of the last `b` elements, where `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2. Each element is counted at most once in this sum.
