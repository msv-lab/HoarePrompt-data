You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.

    return ans
    #The program returns the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the ceiling of `k / 2` (`a`) plus the number of elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to the integer division of `k` by 2 (`b`), where each element is counted at most once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of elements in the list `nums`), `k` (a positive integer), and `nums` (a list of `n` positive integers). It returns either `n` if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the elements in `nums`, or it returns the number of elements in `nums` that contribute to the sum of the first `a` elements and the sum of the last `b` elements, where `a` is the ceiling of `k / 2` and `b` is the integer division of `k` by 2. Each element is counted at most once in this sum.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It then reads the durability of each ship into the list `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` first checks if the total number of attacks `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of all ship durabilities. If so, it returns `n`, indicating that all ships will sink. This is a valid and efficient check.

3. **Attack Simulation**:
   - The function calculates the number of attacks on the first and last ships using `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2` respectively. This is because the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of ships that sink.
   - It also initializes `s_a` and `s_b` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative durability of the ships attacked from the front and the back.

4. **Loop for Attack Simulation**:
   - The loop iterates over each ship and adds its durability to `s_a` and `s_b` for the front and back attacks, respectively.
   - If the cumulative durability `s_a` is less than or equal to the number of front attacks `a`, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the ship has sunk.
   - Similarly, if the cumulative durability `s_b` is less than or equal to the number of back attacks `b`, it increments `ans` by 1, indicating that the ship has sunk.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Double Counting**: The program may double count a ship if it is attacked from both the front and the back. For example, if a ship is attacked from the front and then from the back, it should only be counted once as sunk, but the current implementation might count it twice.
- **Incorrect Logic for Alternating Attacks**: The logic for alternating attacks is not correctly implemented. The program should simulate the attacks in the correct order (first, last, first, last, etc.) and stop once the number of attacks `k` is exhausted.

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks, we need to use a deque to efficiently remove ships from both ends as they sink. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import deque
import math

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    ships = deque(nums)
    sunk = 0
    while k > 0 and ships:
        # Attack the first ship
        if ships[0] > 0:
            ships[0] -= 1
            if ships[0] == 0:
                ships.popleft()
                sunk += 1
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
        # Attack the last ship
        if ships and ships[-1] > 0:
            ships[-1] -= 1
            if ships[-1] == 0:
                ships.pop()
                sunk += 1
            k -= 1
    return sunk
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has issues with double counting and incorrect logic for alternating attacks.
- The corrected program uses a deque to simulate the attacks correctly and ensures that each ship is only counted once when it sinks.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
