To determine what will be printed by the `print(*a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the transformation applied to the list `a`.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a list that contains the cumulative sums of its original values.
- `b` is a list that will contain cumulative sums of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1`.
- `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged and are not relevant to the output of `print(*a)`.

### Transformation:
- For each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if the new `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 1`; otherwise, `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 2`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `a`**:
   - The list `a` now contains the cumulative sums of its original values.
   - This means that each element in `a` is the sum of all previous elements in the original list up to that index.

2. **Understanding `b`**:
   - The list `b` is constructed based on the values in `a`.
   - For each index `i`, if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i-1] + 1`.
   - If `a[i] <= 1`, then `b[i] = b[i-1] + 2`.

3. **Output of `print(*a)`**:
   - The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.
   - Since `a` contains the cumulative sums of its original values, the output will be the cumulative sums of the original list.

### Example:
Let's assume the original list `a` was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

- The cumulative sums of the original list `a` would be:
  - `a[0] = 1`
  - `a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`
  - `a[2] = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
  - `a[3] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`
  - `a[4] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`

So, the list `a` after transformation would be `[1, 3, 6, 10, 15]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*a)` statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces. Since `a` contains the cumulative sums of its original values, the output will be the cumulative sums of the original list.

Output: **1 3 6 10 15 (where the values are the cumulative sums of the original list `a`)**
