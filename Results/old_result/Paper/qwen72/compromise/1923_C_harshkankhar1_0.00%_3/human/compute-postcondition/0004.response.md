Output State: **The list `b` will contain cumulative sums of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Specifically, for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 1`; otherwise, `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 2`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` will remain unchanged.**
