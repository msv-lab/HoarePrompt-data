The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `q`. The loop will execute `q` times, so for the loop to execute, `q` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
