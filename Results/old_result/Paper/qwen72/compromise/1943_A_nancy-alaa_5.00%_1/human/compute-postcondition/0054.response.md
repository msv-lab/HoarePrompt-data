Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i < n\).
   - `_` is 1.
   - `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `first` is False if `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` was True. Otherwise, `first` remains False.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 1.
   - The value of `i` is not modified in the given code snippet.
   - Therefore, when the `print(i)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The code will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
