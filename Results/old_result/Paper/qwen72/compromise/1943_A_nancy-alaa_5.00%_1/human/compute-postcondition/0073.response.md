Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if any integer from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr` and was encountered after the first such integer, otherwise `first` is False.**

The value of `n` is updated to the input integer provided by the user, which is greater than 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
