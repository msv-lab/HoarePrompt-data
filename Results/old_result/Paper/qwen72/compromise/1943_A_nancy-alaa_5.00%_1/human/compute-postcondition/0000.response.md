The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
