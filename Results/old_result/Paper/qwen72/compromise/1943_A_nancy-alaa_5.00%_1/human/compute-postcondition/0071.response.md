Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `_` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, and `first` is True if any integer from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr` and was encountered after the first such integer, otherwise `first` is False.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 20,000.
- The variable `n` remains an integer greater than 0.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n-1`.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The list `arr` remains the list of integers input by the user.
- The `Counter` object `mpp` still counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `first` will be True if any integer from 0 to `n-1` appears exactly once in `arr` and was encountered after the first such integer. Otherwise, `first` will be False.
