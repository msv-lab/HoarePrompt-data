Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the final score of the game based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Counter Usage**: The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. This is efficient and helps in determining the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: Alice wants to maximize the score, so she will try to include as many unique elements as possible in the array `c`.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: Bob wants to minimize the score, so he will try to remove elements that Alice might need to maximize the score.

4. **Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1` to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `arr` (MEX).
   - If an integer `i` is not in the `Counter` keys, it means it is the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in the array and Alice has already taken an element (indicated by `first` being `True`), Bob will take this element to prevent Alice from including it in `c`. In this case, the MEX is `i`, and the program prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once and Alice has not yet taken an element, Alice will take this element, and the program sets `first` to `True`.

This logic ensures that the program correctly simulates the optimal strategies of both players and determines the final score of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.
