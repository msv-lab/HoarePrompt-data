### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to achieve their goal.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many small integers as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to exclude as many small integers as possible from `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - If an integer `i` appears more than once in `a`, Alice can always pick it on her turn, and Bob will not be able to prevent it from being in `c`.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`, Alice will pick it on her first turn, and Bob will pick it on his turn if it is the smallest such integer.
   - If an integer `i` does not appear in `a`, it will be the MEX of `c`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It iterates through the integers from 0 to `n-1` and checks:
     - If `i` is not in `a`, it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` appears exactly once and it is Alice's turn (indicated by `first`), it prints `i` and breaks the loop.
     - If `i` appears exactly once and it is Bob's turn, it sets `first` to `True` to indicate that Alice will pick the next smallest integer that appears exactly once.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles cases where `a` contains integers from 0 to `n-1` and where some integers are missing.
   - It correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in `a` or the smallest integer that appears exactly once and is picked by Alice.

6. **Optimality:**
   - The program ensures that Alice picks the smallest integer that appears exactly once on her first turn, and Bob will pick the next smallest integer that appears exactly once on his turn.
   - This strategy ensures that the MEX of `c` is maximized by Alice and minimized by Bob, which is the optimal play for both.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob to determine the final score of the game. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
