Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - (b[i] * 2)`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i] - b[i]`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` are updated as specified, and the loop or if statement continues.***
