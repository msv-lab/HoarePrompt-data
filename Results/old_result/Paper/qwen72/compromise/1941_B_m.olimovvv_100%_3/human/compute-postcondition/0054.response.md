Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is an input integer, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `a - 2`, `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0, `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`, and `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`. If any element in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[a-2]` was less than 0 during the loop, the loop would have terminated early with a 'NO' output. If `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` are not 0 after the loop, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a new list of integers from the user and assigns it to `b`.
- The initial state specifies that `b` was a list of integers, but the new input overwrites the previous list.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains `a - 2`.
- The conditions for `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` being 0, and the specific updates to `b[a-2]` and `b[a-1]` are no longer applicable because `b` has been redefined with new input.
- The conditions for early termination of the loop or the final output based on `b[-1]` and `b[-2]` remain valid, but they will be evaluated based on the new list `b`.

Thus, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `t`, `n`, and `a`, the new value of `b` from user input, and the conditions that will be checked based on the new `b`.
