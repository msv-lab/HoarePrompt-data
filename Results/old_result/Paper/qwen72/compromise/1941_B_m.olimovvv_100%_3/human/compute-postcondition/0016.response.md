Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is an integer such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - (b[i] * 2)`, `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i] - b[i]`. If `b[i]` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `b[i]` is 0.
- The code `b[i + 2] -= b[i]` is executed, which means `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`.
- Since `b[i]` is 0, `b[i + 2]` is updated to `b[i + 2] - 0`, which simplifies to `b[i + 2] - b[i]`.
- The previous value of `b[i + 2]` was already `b[i + 2] - b[i]` due to the initial state, so the new value of `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i] - b[i]`, which is `b[i + 2] - 2 * b[i]`.
- The value of `b[i]` remains 0, so the condition `if b[i] < 0` is not met, and the loop or if statement is not broken.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
