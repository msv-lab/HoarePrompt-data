The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `a - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1, and `a` must still be at least 3 (so that `a - 2` is at least 1).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` must be at least 3, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `b[0]` is 0, and `b[2]` is updated to `b[2] - b[0]`**
