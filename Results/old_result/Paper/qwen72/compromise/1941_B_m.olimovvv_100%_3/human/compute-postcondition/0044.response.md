The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `a`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `a - 2`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `a` is at least 3

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2
- `a` must still be at least 3 for `i` to be less than `a - 2`

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is at least 3, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 2, `b[0]` is 0, `b[1]` is 0, `b[2]` is `b[2] - b[1] * 2 - b[0]`. If `b[1]` was less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
