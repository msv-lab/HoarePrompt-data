Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element \(a_j\) is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_j \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `b` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is 1.
- `b[i]` is 0.
- `b[i + 1]` is `b[i + 1] - (b[i] * 2)`.
- `b[i + 2]` is `b[i + 2] - b[i]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'NO'`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not used in the `print` statement.
- The modifications to `b[i + 1]` and `b[i + 2]` do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
