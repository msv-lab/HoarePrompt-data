Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
   - `a` is an integer greater than 2.
   - `b` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b[0]` to `b[a-3]` are all 0.
   - `b[a-2]` is `b[a-2] - 2 * b[a-3]`.
   - `b[a-1]` is `b[a-1] - b[a-3]`.
   - The current value of `b[0]` is less than 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('NO')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing a string literal `'NO'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables and the list `b`, but it does not affect the `print` statement directly.
   - The condition that `b[0]` is less than 0 is given, but it does not influence the output of the `print` statement.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'NO'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, or `i`.

Output: **NO**
