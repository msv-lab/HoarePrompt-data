### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `func_1` should be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. However, the function is currently defined without any parameters, which is incorrect.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads input values `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, followed by the string `s`. This part is correct.

3. **Set of Unique Characters:**
   - The set `us` is correctly created to contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

4. **Processing the String:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to track unique characters in the string `s`. When the window `win` contains `k` unique characters, it adds the current character to `ans` and clears the window.
   - The variable `ps` counts the number of times the window `win` reaches the size `k`.

5. **Checking for All Possible Subsequences:**
   - The function checks if `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`.
   - If `ps` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and attempts to construct a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

6. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The function tries to find a character in `us` that is not in `win` and appends it to `ans` followed by `n - ps - 1` 'a' characters.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid subsequence that does not occur in `s`.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Function Definition:** The function should accept parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The current definition is incorrect.
- **Subsequence Check:** The function's logic for checking if all possible subsequences of length `n` occur in `s` is incorrect. It only counts the number of times a window of `k` unique characters is formed, which is not sufficient to determine if all possible subsequences of length `n` are present.
- **Missing Subsequence Construction:** The construction of the missing subsequence is also incorrect. It does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid subsequence that does not occur in `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It has issues with the function definition, the logic for checking subsequences, and the construction of the missing subsequence.

Correctness: **False**
