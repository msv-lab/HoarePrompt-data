Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def func_1(n, k, s):
```

**Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.**
