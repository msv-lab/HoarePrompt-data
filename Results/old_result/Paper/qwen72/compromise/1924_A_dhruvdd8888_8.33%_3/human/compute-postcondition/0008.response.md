To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, let's break down the loop and its effects on the variables:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, split by spaces.
   - `s` is a string containing the input values.
   - `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English letters.
   - `win` is an empty set.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `ps` is 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If `i` is in the set `us`, it is added to the set `win`.
   - If the length of `win` reaches `k`, the character `i` is appended to the list `ans`, `ps` is incremented by 1, and `win` is cleared.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop, `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
   - `s` remains unchanged because it is only iterated over and not modified.
   - `us` remains unchanged because it is only used for checking membership and not modified.
   - `win` will be an empty set because every time it reaches the size `k`, it is cleared.
   - `ans` will contain the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`.
   - `ps` will be the number of times `win` reached the size `k`.

Let's summarize the output state:

Output State: **`n`, `k`, `m`, `s`, `us` remain unchanged; `win` is an empty set; `ans` contains the characters that were added when `win` reached the size `k`; `ps` is the number of times `win` reached the size `k`.**
