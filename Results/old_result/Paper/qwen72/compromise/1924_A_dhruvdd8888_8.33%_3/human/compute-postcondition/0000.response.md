Initial State: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n`, `k`, and `s` to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:
```
n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet `n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))` reads input from the user, splits it into three parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n`, `k`, and `m`.

Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `m` are assigned the integer values from the input, split by spaces.**
