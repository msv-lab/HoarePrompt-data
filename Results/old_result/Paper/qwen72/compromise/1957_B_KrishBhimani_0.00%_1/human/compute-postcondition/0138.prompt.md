Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: _ is 2, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 0, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, c is 0, ans is [], and arr is a list of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of k0, starting from 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    if c == n - 1:
        ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))
        break
    c += 1
    ans.append(1 << i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k0`, `c` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`, and `arr` is a list of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`, starting from 0 and must have at least one element. If `c` is `n - 1`, `ans` is [k0] and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` and `1 << i`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` also contains the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`, `c` is 3, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `1 << i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
