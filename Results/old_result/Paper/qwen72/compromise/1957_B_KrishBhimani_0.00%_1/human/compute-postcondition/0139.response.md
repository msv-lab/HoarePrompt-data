Output State: **_ is 2, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 0, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1 and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, i is the number of bits in the binary representation of k0, c is equal to n, ans is a list containing the values 1 << i for each i in arr, and if c is equal to n - 1, ans also contains the value k0 - sum(ans), and ans has been extended with (n - len(ans)) zeros.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is unchanged for all variables except `ans`.
- The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` extends the list `ans` with zeros such that its length becomes `n`.
- The number of zeros added is `n - len(ans)`.
- Therefore, the final state of `ans` is the original list `ans` extended with `(n - len(ans))` zeros.
