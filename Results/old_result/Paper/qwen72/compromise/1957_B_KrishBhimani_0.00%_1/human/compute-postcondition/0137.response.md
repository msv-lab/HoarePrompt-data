Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`, `c` is 3, and `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `1 << i`.** 

The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value `1 << i` to the list `ans`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains three elements, each of which is `1 << i`. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` will also contain the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains a list with the three elements `1 << i`.
