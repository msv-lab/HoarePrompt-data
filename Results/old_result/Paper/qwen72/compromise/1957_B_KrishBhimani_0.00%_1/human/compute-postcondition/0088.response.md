Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0, `arr` is [0, 1], `c` is 2, `ans` is [2, 2]. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to [2, 2, `k0` - 4], and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
