Output State: **_ is 1, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 1, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1, i is 0, arr is [0, 1], c is 3, ans is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`).**

Explanation:
- The length of `ans` initially is 3.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends `n - len(ans)` zeros to the list `ans`.
- Therefore, the final length of `ans` is `n`, and the additional elements are zeros.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
