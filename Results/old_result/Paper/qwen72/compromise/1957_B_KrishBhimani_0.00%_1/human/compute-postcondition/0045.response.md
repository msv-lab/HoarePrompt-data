Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the last element of `arr`, `arr` contains all the indices of the bits that were set to 1 in the binary representation of `k0`, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i` for each `i` in `arr` until `c` reaches `n - 1`. If `c` reaches `n - 1`, the last element of `ans` is `k0 - sum(ans)`, and the loop breaks. `c` is equal to the number of elements in `ans`. `ans` is now padded with zeros to make its length equal to `n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` pads the list `ans` with zeros until its length is equal to `n`.
- The length of `ans` before the code execution is `c`, which is the number of elements in `ans`.
- After the code execution, `ans` will have `n` elements, with the additional elements being zeros.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
