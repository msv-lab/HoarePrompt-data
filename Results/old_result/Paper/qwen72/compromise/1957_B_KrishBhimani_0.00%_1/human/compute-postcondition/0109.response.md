The value of `k` is updated by performing a bitwise right shift operation (`k = k >> 1`). This operation effectively divides `k` by 2 and rounds down to the nearest integer. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` divided by 4 (and rounded down if necessary) and must be greater than 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `c` is 3, `ans` is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0, ..., 0] (where the number of zeros appended is `n - len(ans)`). If `k` was odd before the operation, `arr` is [1]. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list.**
