Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `c` is 0. If `c` is equal to `n - 1`, `ans` is a list containing the value `k0`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` remains an empty list.***
