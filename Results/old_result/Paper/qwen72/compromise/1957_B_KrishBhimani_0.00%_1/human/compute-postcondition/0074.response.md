Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 1, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1, `arr` is [0], `ans` is a list containing the value `k0`, `c` is 0, and the current value of `c` is equal to `n - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value of `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` is an empty list, so `sum(ans)` is 0.
- Therefore, `k0 - sum(ans)` is simply `k0`.
- After the code executes, `ans` now contains the value `k0`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
