The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, the loop will execute `t` times based on the problem statement, so `int(input())` should be `t`.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be `t` and `t` must be greater than 0**
