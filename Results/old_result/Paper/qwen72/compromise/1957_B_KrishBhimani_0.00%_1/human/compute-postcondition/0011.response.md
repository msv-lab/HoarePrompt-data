Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must be non-zero, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 1. If `k` was an odd number, `arr` is a list containing `[0]`. Otherwise, `arr` remains an empty list. `k` is now equal to `k` right-shifted by 1 (i.e., `k` is divided by 2 and the result is floored).**
