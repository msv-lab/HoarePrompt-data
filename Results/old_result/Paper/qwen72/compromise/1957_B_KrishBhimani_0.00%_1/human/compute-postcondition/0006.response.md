The only variable in the loop head is `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is truthy (i.e., not 0), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `k` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must be non-zero, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is 0**
