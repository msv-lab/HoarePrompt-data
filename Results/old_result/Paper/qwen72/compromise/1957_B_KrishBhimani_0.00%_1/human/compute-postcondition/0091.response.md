Output State: **_ is 1, t is greater than 0, l1 is a list of strings obtained from the input, n is the integer value of the first element in l1, k is 1, k0 is the integer value of the second element in l1, i is 0, arr is [0, 1], c is 3, ans is [2, 2, 1].**

Natural Language Description:
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The list `l1` remains unchanged.
- The variable `n` is still the integer value of the first element in `l1`.
- The variable `k` remains 1.
- The variable `k0` remains the integer value of the second element in `l1`.
- The variable `i` is 0 (this is the value of `i` after the last iteration, but it is not used in subsequent iterations).
- The list `arr` remains [0, 1].
- The variable `c` is 3, indicating that the loop has executed 3 times.
- The list `ans` is [2, 2, 1], which is the result of appending the values `2`, `2`, and `1` during the 3 iterations of the loop.
