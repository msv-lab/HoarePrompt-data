Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the next element in `arr` after the current `i`, `c` is 2, `ans` is a list containing the values `1 << i`, `1 << i`, and `k0 - sum(ans)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
