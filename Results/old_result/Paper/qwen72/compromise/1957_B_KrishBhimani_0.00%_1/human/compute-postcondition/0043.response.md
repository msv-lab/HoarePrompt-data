Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1`, `i` is the third element of `arr`, `arr` must contain at least three elements, `c` is increased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans` now contains the value `1 << i` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(1 << i)` appends the value of `1 << i` to the list `ans`.
- `1 << i` is a bitwise left shift operation, which shifts the binary representation of 1 to the left by `i` positions. This is equivalent to `2 ** i`.
- The value of `i` is the third element of `arr`, so the result of `1 << i` is `2 ** i`.
- The states of all other variables remain unchanged.
- `ans` now contains the value `2 ** i` appended to it.
