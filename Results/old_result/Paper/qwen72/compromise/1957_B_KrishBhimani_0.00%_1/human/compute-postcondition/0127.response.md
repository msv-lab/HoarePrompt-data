Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `l1` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element in `l1`, `k` is 0, `k0` is the integer value of the second element in `l1` and must have at least one 1 in its binary representation, `i` is the next element in `arr`, `c` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value `1 << i` and the value `k0 - sum(ans)`, and `arr` is a list of the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k0`, starting from 0 and must have at least one more element.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(k0 - sum(ans))` appends the value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the list `ans`.
- Initially, `ans` contains the value `1 << i`.
- The `sum(ans)` is the sum of the elements in `ans`, which is `1 << i`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `ans` is `k0 - (1 << i)`.
- All other variables (`_`, `t`, `l1`, `n`, `k`, `k0`, `i`, `c`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
