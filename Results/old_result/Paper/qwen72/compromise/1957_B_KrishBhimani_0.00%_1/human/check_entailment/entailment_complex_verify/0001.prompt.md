You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it generates a list `ans` of length `n` such that the sum of the elements in `ans` equals `k`. The list `ans` contains powers of 2 corresponding to the positions of set bits in the binary representation of `k`, and if necessary, the last element is adjusted to ensure the sum equals `k`. Any remaining positions in `ans` are filled with zeros. The function prints the elements of `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, `k` being 0, and `ans` being the final list for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Binary Representation and Bitwise OR**:
   - The program aims to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.
   - It first identifies the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of `k` by iterating through the bits of `k` and appending the positions of the 1s to the list `arr`.

3. **Constructing the Sequence**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence of integers.
   - It then iterates through the positions in `arr` and constructs the sequence by setting the corresponding bit in the integers.
   - If the number of integers in `ans` is less than `n-1`, it continues to add integers with the identified bits set.
   - If the number of integers in `ans` reaches `n-1`, it adds the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the sequence to ensure the sum is `k`.
   - Finally, it pads the sequence with zeros to ensure the length of the sequence is exactly `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sequence for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Sum Condition**:
  - The program ensures that the sum of the sequence equals `k` by adding the remaining value `k0 - sum(ans)` to the sequence when it has `n-1` elements.
  - This is correct because it guarantees that the sum of the sequence is exactly `k`.

- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation**:
  - The program sets the bits in the sequence to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
  - By setting the bits in the positions identified in `arr`, the program ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 by directly printing `k`.
  - It also handles the case where `k` is 0 by printing a sequence of `n` zeros, though this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem constraints (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly follows the problem constraints and requirements. It constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR.

### Correctness:
**True**
