To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop head involves the following variables:
- `i`: This is the loop variable that will take values from `n - 1` down to `0`.
- `n`: This is the upper bound for the loop, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1.
- `mex` is equal to `n`.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0. The loop will start with `i` set to `n - 1` and decrement `i` until it reaches -1. Therefore, the initial state of `i` must be `n - 1` for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is -1, `mex` is equal to `n`, `i` is `n - 1`**
