Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 < t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1` except `p[n-1]` which is `mex - a[n-1]`, `p[n-2]` which is `mex - a[n-2]`, and `p[n-3]` which is `mex - a[n-3]`, `mex` is `min(n, mex - a[n-1], p[n-2])`, `i` is `n - 3`**

Explanation:
- The code `p[i] = mex - a[i]` updates the value of `p[i]` where `i` is `n - 3`.
- The value of `p[n-3]` is now `mex - a[n-3]`.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
