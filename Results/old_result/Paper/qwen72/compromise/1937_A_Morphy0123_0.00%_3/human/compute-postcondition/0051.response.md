Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is 2.
2. `n_cases` is greater than 2.
3. `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\).
4. `power` is \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\).
5. The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **`i` is 2**: This is a simple integer value.
2. **`n_cases` is greater than 2**: This is a condition on `n_cases`, but it doesn't directly affect the calculation of `power` or `n`.
3. **`n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\)**: This is a condition that must be satisfied by `n` and `power`.
4. **`power` is \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\)**: This formula calculates the value of `power` based on `n`.
5. **The current value of `power` is equal to `n`**: This is a crucial piece of information. It implies that `n` and `power` are the same value.

Given that `power` is equal to `n`, we can substitute `n` for `power` in the formula:
\[ power = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1 \]

Since `power` is equal to `n`, we have:
\[ n = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1 \]

This equation is not straightforward to solve algebraically, but we can reason about it. For `n` to be equal to \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\), `n` must be a power of 2. Let's test some values:

- If \( n = 2 \):
  \[ \lfloor \log_2(2) \rfloor + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \]
  This satisfies the equation.

- If \( n = 4 \):
  \[ \lfloor \log_2(4) \rfloor + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \]
  This does not satisfy the equation.

- If \( n = 8 \):
  \[ \lfloor \log_2(8) \rfloor + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \]
  This does not satisfy the equation.

- If \( n = 16 \):
  \[ \lfloor \log_2(16) \rfloor + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
  This does not satisfy the equation.

From this, we can see that the only value of `n` that satisfies the equation \( n = \lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1 \) is \( n = 2 \).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(2 ** power)
```

Since `power` is equal to `n` and `n` is 2, we substitute `power` with 2:
\[ 2 ** power = 2 ** 2 = 4 \]

### Final Output:
Output: **4**
