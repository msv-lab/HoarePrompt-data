Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `i` remains 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n_cases` remains greater than 0, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `n` remains an input integer and is not equal to 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `power` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop until it is no longer less than `log2(n)`. Therefore, after all iterations, `power` will be the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to `log2(n)`. This means `power` will be the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq n\).
