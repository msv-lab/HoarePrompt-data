To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n_cases`. The loop will execute if `n_cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range function in Python.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0**
