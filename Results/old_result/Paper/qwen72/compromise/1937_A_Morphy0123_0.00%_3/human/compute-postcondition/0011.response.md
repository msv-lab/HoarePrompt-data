To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition `power < log2(n)`:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`.
2. **Current State**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `n_cases` must be greater than 0
   - `n` must be greater than 4
   - `power` is 3

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute again if `power` is less than `log2(n)`.
4. **Current Values**:
   - `power` is 3
   - `n` must be greater than 4, but we need to ensure that `log2(n)` is greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

5. **Adjustment**:
   - To ensure the loop condition `power < log2(n)` is true, `log2(n)` must be greater than 3.
   - This means `n` must be greater than \(2^3 = 8\).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 8.

State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 8, `power` is 3**
