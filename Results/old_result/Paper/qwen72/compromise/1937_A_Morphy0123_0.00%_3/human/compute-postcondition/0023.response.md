The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state specifies that `i` is 1, `n_cases` is greater than 1, and `n` is an input integer. However, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables; it simply prints the constant integer `1`.

Output: **1**
