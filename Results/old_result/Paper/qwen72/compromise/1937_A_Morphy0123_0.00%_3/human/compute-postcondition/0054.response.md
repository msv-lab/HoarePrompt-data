Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n_cases` is greater than 2.
   - `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\).
   - `power` is \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\).
   - `power` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(2 ** power)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The value of `power` is given as \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\), which means `power` is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\).
   - The condition `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\) ensures that `n` is sufficiently large to satisfy this inequality.
   - The condition `power` is not equal to `n` means that `power` is a distinct integer from `n`.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output \(2^{\text{power}}\).
   - Since `power` is \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\), the output will be \(2^{\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor}\).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact numerical value of \(2^{\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor}\) depends on the value of `n`, but it will always be the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

Output: **2^{\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor} (where \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\log_2(n)\))**
