The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `power < log2(n)`. At the end of the last iteration, `power` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `power` must still be less than `log2(n)` after the adjustment. Since `power` is 2, `n` must be greater than 4 (because `log2(4) = 2` and `log2(n)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue).

State: **`i` is 2, `n_cases` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `power` is 2**
