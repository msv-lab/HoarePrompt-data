Output State: **`i` is 0, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 1, `power` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1, and `power` is not equal to `n`.**

The value of `power` is decremented by 1, so it is now the smallest integer greater than or equal to `log2(n)` minus 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
