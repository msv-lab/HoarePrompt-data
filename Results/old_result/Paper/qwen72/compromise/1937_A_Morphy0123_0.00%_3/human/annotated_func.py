#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that it should be called with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array `a`, and the function should internally handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `i` is `n_cases - 1`, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\) if `power` is equal to `n`, or greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\) if `power` is not equal to `n`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\). If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is updated to \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints a specific value based on the following logic: If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. If `n` is exactly a power of 2, it prints `2
