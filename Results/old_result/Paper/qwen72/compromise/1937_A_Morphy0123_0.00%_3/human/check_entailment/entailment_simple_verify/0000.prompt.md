You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program: 
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import log2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any input parameters, but the problem description implies that it should be called with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) representing the length of the array `a`, and the function should internally handle multiple test cases, each with a different value of `n`.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: `i` is `n_cases - 1`, `n_cases` is greater than or equal to 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is 1, the program maintains the initial state. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than \(2^{(power-1)}\) if `power` is equal to `n`, or greater than \(2^{(power-2)}\) if `power` is not equal to `n`. If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor + 1\). If `power` is not equal to `n`, `power` is updated to \(\lfloor \log_2(n) \rfloor\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input `n` is a power of 2 minus 1. For example, when `n = 7`, the correct position of 1 after performing the swap operations should be 4, but the program outputs 8. This is because the logic for calculating the position of 1 is flawed. The program incorrectly increments the `power` variable and then checks if `power` is equal to `n`, which is not the correct way to determine the position of 1 in the array after the swaps.
