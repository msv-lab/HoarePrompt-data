Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least `ln` elements, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`palka`**: This list must have at least `ln` elements for the loop to execute completely.
- **`pl`**: After the loop completes, `pl` will contain all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared.
- **`d`**: The dictionary `d` will have keys corresponding to each unique element in `palka`, and the value for each key will be the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
