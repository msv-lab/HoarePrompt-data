The code snippet `pl.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `pl`. Given the initial conditions, let's determine the output state:

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
- `w` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `ln` is an input integer.
- `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 3 elements.
- `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`.
- `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the second element in `palka`). If `i` was not already in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and the value of `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

After executing `pl.append(i)`:

- The value of `i` (which is the second element in `palka`) is appended to the list `pl`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`, `d`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least 3 elements, `pl` is a list that now contains the first element of `palka` and the second element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` (the second element in `palka`). If `i` was not already in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and the value of `d[i]` is set to 1. If `i` was already in `pl`, `pl` remains unchanged and the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.**
