Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. The current value of `d.get(i)` is `None`, indicating that the key `i` is not present in the dictionary `d`.**
