To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the steps involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
   - `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
   - `w` is greater than 2.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `ln` is an input integer.
   - `palka` is a list of integers read from input.
   - `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
   - `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

2. **Steps to Determine `shapes`:**
   - **`palka`**: This is a list of integers read from input. The exact values are not specified, but they are integers within the range 1 to 100.
   - **`pl`**: This is a list of unique elements from `palka`. For example, if `palka = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]`, then `pl = [1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - **`d`**: This is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`. Using the same example, `d = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 1}`.
   - **`shapes`**: This is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. From the example, only the element `3` appears at least 3 times, so `shapes = 1`.

3. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will print the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

Given the initial state and the steps, the output will be:

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`)**

This means the output will be the count of unique elements in the list `pl` that have a frequency of at least 3 in the list `palka`.
