Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ln = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `ln`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `ln` which is an input integer.
