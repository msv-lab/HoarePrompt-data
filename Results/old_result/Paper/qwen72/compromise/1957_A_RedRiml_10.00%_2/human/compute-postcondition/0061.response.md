The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `palka`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `palka`. If there are more elements in `palka`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the second element of `palka`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next (third) element in `palka`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least two elements, `pl` is a list, `d` is a dictionary, `i` is the third element of `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl` and `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**
