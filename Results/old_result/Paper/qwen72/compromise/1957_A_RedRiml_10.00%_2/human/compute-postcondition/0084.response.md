The code snippet `palka = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `palka`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100
- `w` is greater than 2
- `_` is 2
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers read from input
- `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`
- `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`
- `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`

After executing the code snippet, the variable `palka` is updated to contain a list of integers read from the input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**
