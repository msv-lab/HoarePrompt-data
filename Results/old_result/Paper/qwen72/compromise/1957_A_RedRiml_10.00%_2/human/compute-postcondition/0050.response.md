The code snippet `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Since `i` is a key that exists in `d` with a non-None value, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least one element, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is a dictionary where the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. Additionally, `i` is a key that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value.**
