The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Dictionary `d`**: The value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` is incremented by 1. If `i` was already a key in `d`, its value is increased by 1. If `i` was not a key in `d`, it would have been initialized to 1 before this operation, and now it is incremented to 2.

2. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` remains the same, as it is used to access the dictionary `d`.

3. **List `pl`**: The list `pl` is not directly modified by this code, but the condition that `i` is added to `pl` if it is not already present in `pl` remains unchanged.

4. **Other Variables**: The values of `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, `_`, `ln`, `palka`, and `shapes` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must contain at least two elements, `pl` is a list that may or may not contain the integer `i`, `d` is a dictionary where `d[i]` is incremented by 1, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`, and `i` is the next element in `palka` that exists in the dictionary `d` with a non-None value. If `i` is not in `pl`, then `i` is added to `pl`.**
