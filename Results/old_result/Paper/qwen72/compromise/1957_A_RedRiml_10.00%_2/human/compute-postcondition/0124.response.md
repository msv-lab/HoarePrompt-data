Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is equal to the initial value of `w` (an integer), `_` is `w - 1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input, `pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka`, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`**: Remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`w`**: Remains unchanged as it is the loop counter's limit and is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: After the loop completes, `_` will be equal to `w - 1` because the loop runs `w` times, and `_` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- **`ln`**: This is an input integer read during each iteration of the loop, so it will be the last input integer read before the loop ends.
- **`palka`**: This is a list of integers read from input during each iteration of the loop, so it will be the last list of integers read before the loop ends.
- **`pl`**: This is a list containing all unique elements from the last `palka` read.
- **`d`**: This is a dictionary where each key is an element from the last `palka` read, and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
- **`shapes`**: This is the number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in the last `palka` read.
