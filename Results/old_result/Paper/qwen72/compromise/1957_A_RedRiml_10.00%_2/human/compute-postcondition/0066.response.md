Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers read from input and must have at least two elements, `pl` is a list, `d` is a dictionary, `i` is the third element of `palka`. If `d[i]` was initially None, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `shapes` is the total number of unique elements in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` now includes the value of `i` as its last element.***
