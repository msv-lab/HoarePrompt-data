Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is an input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `hd` is equal to `a1 - a2`, `res` is equal to the absolute value of `a1 - a2`, and `i` is 0. If `hd` > 0, `hd` is updated to `a1 - a2 - 1` and the program skips the rest of the loop body, proceeding to the next iteration.***
