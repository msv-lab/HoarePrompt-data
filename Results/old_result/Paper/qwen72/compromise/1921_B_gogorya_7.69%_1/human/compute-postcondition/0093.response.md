Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads two integers `t` and `n`, and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. It calculates the Hamming distance (number of differing positions) between `s1` and `s2` with a specific adjustment: if the number of '1's in `s1` is greater than in `s2`, it reduces the Hamming distance by the difference in the number of '1's. Otherwise, it increments the Hamming distance for each position where `s1` has '1' and `s2` has '0'. The function prints the adjusted Hamming distance for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
