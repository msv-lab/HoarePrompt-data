Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s and f are strings of length n consisting of characters '0' and '1', and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**

The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which must satisfy the condition 1 <= t <= 10^4. The other variables (`n`, `s`, and `f`) and their conditions remain unchanged.
