Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in the new `s2`, `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is `max(0, a1 - a2 - n)`, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus the number of positions `i` where `s1[i] == '1'` and `s2[i] == '0'` for `0 <= i < n` and `hd <= 0`.**
