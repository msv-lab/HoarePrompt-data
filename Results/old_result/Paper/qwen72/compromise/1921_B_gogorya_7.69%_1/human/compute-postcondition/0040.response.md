Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is an input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 0, `hd` is `a1 - a2`, the current value of `hd` is greater than 0, and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.**
