The value of `hd` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `hd` was initially `a1 - a2` or `a1 - a2 - 1` depending on the condition, after decrementing, `hd` will be `a1 - a2 - 1` or `a1 - a2 - 2` respectively.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `s1` is the new input string, `s2` is the new input string, `a1` is the number of '1' characters in `s1`, `a2` is the number of '1' characters in `s2`, `i` is 1, `hd` is `a1 - a2 - 1` or `a1 - a2 - 2` (depending on whether `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'), and `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2` plus 1 if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0', otherwise `res` is the absolute value of `a1 - a2`.**
