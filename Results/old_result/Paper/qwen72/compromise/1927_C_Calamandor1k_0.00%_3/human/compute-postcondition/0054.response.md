Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be at least 1, `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be at least 1, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `count_a` is 2 if `a[0]` ≤ `k` and `len_a` > 1, otherwise `count_a` is 1, `count_b` is 0 (if `len_b` > 1 and `b[0]` ≤ `k`, `count_b` is 1. Otherwise, `count_b` remains 0)**.
