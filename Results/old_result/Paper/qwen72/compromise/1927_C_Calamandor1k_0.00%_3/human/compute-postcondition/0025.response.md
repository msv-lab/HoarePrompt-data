Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 1. If `len_b` > 2 and `b[i]` ≤ `k`, `count_b` is increased by 1. If `len_a` > 2 and `a[i]` ≤ `k`, `count_a` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged.***
