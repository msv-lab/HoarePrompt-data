Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 1, `count_b` is increased by 1.** 

The value of `count_b` is incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
