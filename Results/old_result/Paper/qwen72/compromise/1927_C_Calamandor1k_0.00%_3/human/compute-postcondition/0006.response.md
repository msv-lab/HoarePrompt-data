Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a`, `len_b` is the length of list `b`, `count_a` is 0, `count_b` is 0.**

The variables `count_a` and `count_b` are both initialized to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
