Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder for the loop, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of list `a` and must be greater than 0 or `len_b` is the length of list `b` and must be greater than 0, `d` is `k // 2`, `i` is 0. If `len_a` is greater than 1 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, and `b[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 1. If `len_a` is greater than 1 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, but `b[0]` is greater than `k`, then `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` remains 0. If `len_a` is not greater than 1 or `a[0]` is greater than `k`, and `b[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` remains 0 and `count_b` is 1. If `len_a` is not greater than 1 or `a[0]` is greater than `k`, and `b[0]` is greater than `k`, then `count_a` and `count_b` both remain 0. Additionally, `len_b` is greater than 1.***
