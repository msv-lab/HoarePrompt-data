To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4 - 1\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `m` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `_` is a placeholder for the loop.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `b` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `len_a` is the length of list `a`.
   - `len_b` is the length of list `b`.
   - `d` is `k // 2`.
   - `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`.
   - `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.
   - `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `d` is calculated as `k // 2`, which means `d` is the integer division of `k` by 2.
   - `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.
   - `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.
   - The `print` statement checks if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d`. If both conditions are true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - The output depends on the values of `count_a` and `count_b` relative to `d`.
   - If `count_a` and `count_b` are both at least `d`, the output will be 'YES'.
   - If either `count_a` or `count_b` is less than `d`, the output will be 'NO'.

Given the initial state, we can't determine the exact numerical values of `count_a` and `count_b` without knowing the specific lists `a` and `b`. However, we can describe the conditions under which the output will be 'YES' or 'NO'.

Output: **'YES' if both `count_a` and `count_b` are greater than or equal to `d` (where `d` is `k // 2`), otherwise 'NO' (where `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, and `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`)**
