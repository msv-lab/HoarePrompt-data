### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The variable `t` is calculated as `b * 2` to determine the total number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.
   - The number of screens required for the 2x2 icons is then calculated. If `t` is divisible by 5, `t` is divided by 5. Otherwise, `t` is divided by 5 and 1 is added to account for the remaining cells.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Cells**:
   - The variable `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4` to determine the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons. This is because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons `a`, then no additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are less than the number of 1x1 icons `a`, the function calculates the additional screens required for the 1x1 icons. If the remaining number of 1x1 icons `t2` is divisible by 15, `t2` is divided by 15. Otherwise, `t2` is divided by 15 and 1 is added to account for the remaining cells.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons.
- The function then correctly calculates the number of remaining cells and checks if they are sufficient for the 1x1 icons.
- If additional screens are needed for the 1x1 icons, the function correctly calculates the number of additional screens.

However, there is a potential issue in the calculation of `t1`:
- The variable `t` is initially calculated as the number of screens required for 2x2 icons, but it is then used to calculate the remaining cells `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This is incorrect because `t` should represent the number of screens, not the number of cells occupied by 2x2 icons.

### Correct Calculation:
- The number of screens required for 2x2 icons should be calculated as `b * 4 // 15` and then checked for any remaining cells.
- The remaining cells should be calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        t = (b * 4 + 14) // 15
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Check if the remaining cells are sufficient for 1x1 icons
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            # Calculate additional screens required for 1x1 icons
            t = t + (t2 + 14) // 15
        
        print(t)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical error in the calculation of `t1` and `t`.
- The corrected program correctly calculates the number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
