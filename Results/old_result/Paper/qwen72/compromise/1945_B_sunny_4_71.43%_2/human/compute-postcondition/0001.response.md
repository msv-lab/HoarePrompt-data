The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t` is already given as 1 <= t <= 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and it does not need to be initialized before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the given state already satisfies the condition for the loop to run.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is a throwaway variable**
