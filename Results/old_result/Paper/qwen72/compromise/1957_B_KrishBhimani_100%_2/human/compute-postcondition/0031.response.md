The code `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` appends zeros to the list `ans` until its length matches `n`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` initially contains two elements: `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]`, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`.
- The length of `ans` is 2.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1.
- The number of zeros to append is `n - len(ans)`, which is `n - 2`.

Therefore, `ans` will be extended by `n - 2` zeros.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values `[2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]` followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that `2^i` is less than `k`.**
