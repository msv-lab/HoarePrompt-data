To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.

2. **Construction of `ans`:**
   - `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros.

Let's break this down further:

- **Finding `i`:**
  - We need to find the highest integer `i` such that \(2^i < k\). This means \(2^i\) is the largest power of 2 that is less than `k`.

- **Constructing `ans`:**
  - The first element of `ans` is \(2^i - 1\).
  - The second element of `ans` is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
  - The remaining elements of `ans` are `n - 2` zeros.

### Example Calculation:
Suppose `k = 10` and `n = 5`:
- The highest integer `i` such that \(2^i < 10\) is 3 because \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\) which is greater than 10.
- Therefore, \(2^i - 1 = 2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\).
- The second element is \(k - (2^i - 1) = 10 - 7 = 3\).
- The list `ans` will be \([7, 3, 0, 0, 0]\).

### General Case:
- For any given `k` and `n`:
  - Find the highest integer `i` such that \(2^i < k\).
  - The first element of `ans` is \(2^i - 1\).
  - The second element of `ans` is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
  - The remaining elements are `n - 2` zeros.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Output: **7 3 0 0 0 (where 7 is \(2^i - 1\), 3 is \(k - (2^i - 1)\), and the remaining elements are `n - 2` zeros)**

This format ensures that the output is clear and easily understandable, adhering to the given format.
