Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1. If `n` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \([2^i - 1, k - (2^i - 1)]\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the highest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. Additionally, `temp` is \(2^i\) when `n` is not 1.***
