To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `ans` list step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
   - `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
   - `arr` is an empty list.
   - `k0` is equal to `k`.
   - `ans` is a list containing the values \((2^i - 1)\), \((k - 2^i + 1)\), and `n - 2` zeros.
   - `_` is incremented by 1.
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
   - `temp` is \(2^i\).

2. **Constructing the `ans` List:**
   - `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
   - `temp` is \(2^i\).
   - The first element of `ans` is \((2^i - 1)\).
   - The second element of `ans` is \((k - 2^i + 1)\).
   - The remaining elements of `ans` are `n - 2` zeros.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `k = 10` and `n = 5`.
     - The largest integer `i` such that \(2^i < 10\) is 3 (since \(2^3 = 8\)).
     - `temp` is \(2^3 = 8\).
     - The first element of `ans` is \(2^3 - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7\).
     - The second element of `ans` is \(10 - 8 + 1 = 3\).
     - The remaining elements are `n - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3` zeros.
     - Therefore, `ans` is `[7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

4. **General Case:**
   - For any given `k` and `n`, the `ans` list will be constructed as follows:
     - First element: \(2^i - 1\)
     - Second element: \(k - 2^i + 1\)
     - Remaining elements: `n - 2` zeros.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list separated by spaces.

Given the above steps, the output will be:

Output: **(2^i - 1) (k - 2^i + 1) followed by (n - 2) zeros**

Where:
- \(i\) is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).
- \(2^i - 1\) is the first element.
- \(k - 2^i + 1\) is the second element.
- The remaining elements are `n - 2` zeros.
