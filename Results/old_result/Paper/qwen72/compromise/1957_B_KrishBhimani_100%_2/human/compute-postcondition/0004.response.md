Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and `n` is equal to 1.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(k)
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **List `l1`**: The list `l1` contains at least two elements. The first element is `n`, which is explicitly stated to be 1.
2. **Variable `k`**: The variable `k` is assigned the value of the second element of `l1`.

Since the value of `k` is directly taken from the second element of `l1`, and no further operations or conditions are applied to `k`, the `print(k)` statement will simply print the second element of `l1`.

### Output:
Output: **k (where k is the second element of the list l1)**

This means the output will be the value of the second element in the list `l1`. Since the exact value of the second element is not provided, the output is described in terms of the list `l1`.
