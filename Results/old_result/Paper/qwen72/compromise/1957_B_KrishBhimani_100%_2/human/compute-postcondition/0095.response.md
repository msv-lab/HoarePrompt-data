Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` contains the value `(1 << i) - 1`, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, and `temp` is \(2^i\).**

Explanation:
- The code appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`.
- The value of `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`.
- The value of `temp` is \(2^i\).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
