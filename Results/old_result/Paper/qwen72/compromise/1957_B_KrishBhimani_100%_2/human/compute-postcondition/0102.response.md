Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` represents the number of non-negative integers to be printed and `k` represents their sum. If `n` is 1, the function prints `k`. Otherwise, it constructs a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the first element is the largest power of 2 less than `k` minus 1, the second element is the remaining value needed to reach `k`, and the rest of the elements are zeros. The function prints this list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value. **
