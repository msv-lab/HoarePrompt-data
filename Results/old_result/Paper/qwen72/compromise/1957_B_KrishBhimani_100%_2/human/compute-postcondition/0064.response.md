The code snippet `ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))` extends the list `ans` by appending zeros until its length equals `n`. Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` is initially a list containing the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - 2^i + 1)\).
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- The length of `ans` before the operation is 2 (since it contains two elements).
- The number of zeros to append is calculated as `n - len(ans)`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.

After executing the code, the length of `ans` will be `n`, and the additional elements appended will all be zeros.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the values \((2^i - 1)\), \((k - 2^i + 1)\), and \((n - 2)\) zeros, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`, `temp` is \(2^i\).**
