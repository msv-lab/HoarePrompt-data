For the given task, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute unless there is a break statement within the loop body that is triggered based on certain conditions.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`
- `arr` is an empty list
- `k0` is equal to `k`
- `ans` is an empty list
- `_` is incremented by 1
- If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is set to 1 and `temp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `i` remains 0, `temp` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute one more time unless the break condition inside the loop body is met. The break condition is based on the value of `temp` relative to `k`. However, since the loop head itself does not contain any conditions that would prevent the loop from executing, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is incremented by 1. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is set to 1 and `temp` is set to 2. Otherwise, `i` remains 0, `temp` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
