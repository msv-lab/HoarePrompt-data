Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` has been incremented by the number of test cases processed. For each test case, `n` and `k` are the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. If `n` is 1, the output for that test case is `k`, and `arr` remains an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, the output for that test case is a list of length `n` containing the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - (2^i - 1))\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. The variable `temp` is \(2^i\) for each test case where `n` is not 1.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the loop counter `_` will have been incremented by the total number of test cases `t`. For each test case, the loop processes the input values `n` and `k` according to the conditions specified. If `n` is 1, the output is simply `k`. If `n` is not 1, the loop calculates the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - (2^i - 1))\) and appends `n - 2` zeros to form the final output list. The variable `temp` is set to \(2^i\) for each test case where `n` is not 1. All other variables not directly modified by the loop remain unchanged.
