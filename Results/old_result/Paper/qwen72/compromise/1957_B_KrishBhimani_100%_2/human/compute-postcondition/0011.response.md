For the given `while True:` loop, the condition is always true, meaning the loop will always execute at least once regardless of the values of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the program state are necessary.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 1**
