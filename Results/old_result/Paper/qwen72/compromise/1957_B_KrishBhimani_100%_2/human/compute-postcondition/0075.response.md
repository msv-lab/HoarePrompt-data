The code snippet `ans = []` reassigns the variable `ans` to an empty list. This overrides any previous value that `ans` might have had. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `i` is 0.**
