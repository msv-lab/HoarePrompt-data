For the given `while True:` loop, there are no conditions in the loop head that need to be satisfied for the loop to continue executing. The loop will always execute the next iteration unless there is a `break` statement inside the loop body.

Since the loop head is `while True:`, the loop will always execute one more time regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `l1` is a list of strings from the new input, `n` is the integer value of the first element of the new `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of the new `l1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list. If `temp * 2` is less than `k`, then `i` is 2 and `temp` is 4. Otherwise, `i` is 0, `temp` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
