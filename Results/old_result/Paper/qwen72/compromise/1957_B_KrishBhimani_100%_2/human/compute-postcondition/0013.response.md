Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1` and is not equal to 1, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, `temp` is 2, and the current value of `temp * 2` is 4 (which is still less than `k`).**
