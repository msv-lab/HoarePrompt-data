The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function should accept three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively.

The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, but typically, for such a function, the expected behavior would be to return or print a list of `n` non-negative integers for each test case, where the sum of these integers equals `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it returns or prints a list of `n` non-negative integers whose sum is `k`.**
