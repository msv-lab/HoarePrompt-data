You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `_` has been incremented by the number of test cases processed. For each test case, `n` and `k` are the integer values of the first and second elements of `l1`, respectively. If `n` is 1, the output for that test case is `k`, and `arr` remains an empty list, `k0` is equal to `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 1, the output for that test case is a list of length `n` containing the values \((2^i - 1)\) and \((k - (2^i - 1))\) followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i\) is less than `k`. The variable `temp` is \(2^i\) for each test case where `n` is not 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Specifically, the program constructs the sequence by appending the largest possible power of 2 less than `k` and then the remaining value to reach `k`, followed by zeros. This approach does not always ensure that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `k = 5`. The program outputs `[3, 2]`, which sums to 5, and the bitwise OR of 3 and 2 is `(11)_2 | (10)_2 = (11)_2`, which has 2 ones. However, a better solution would be `[1, 4]`, which also sums to 5, but the bitwise OR of 1 and 4 is `(01)_2 | (100)_2 = (101)_2`, which has 3 ones, thus maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of maximizing the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR for every potential case.
