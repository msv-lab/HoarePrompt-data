The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `times` (where 0 <= `times` <= len(arr)). It returns the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-len(arr), -1 - times)`. This effectively means it returns the difference between the last element and the element that is `times` positions before the last element in the list. If `times` is 0, it returns 0. If `times` is equal to the length of the list, it returns the difference between the last element and the first element.
