### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a grid of length `n` with cells containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell moves left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each starting with a pinball on the i-th cell, and output the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function calculates the difference between the last element of a list and the element `times` positions before the last element.
     - It is used to compute the cumulative sums and differences in the positions of characters in the grid.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
     - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the cumulative positions of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating the cumulative sums and differences as it goes.
     - It prints the results for each starting position.

3. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters.
     - `suffZero` is a list to keep track of the cumulative positions of '<' characters.
     - `ans` is the list to store the results for each starting position.
   - **Processing**:
     - For each character in the string from right to left:
       - If the character is '>', it calculates the time to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and differences.
       - If the character is '<', it updates the cumulative sum of '<' positions.
     - The function prints the results for each starting position.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The cumulative sums and differences are used to efficiently calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for handling the cumulative sums and differences is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions, when used together, correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` processes the string and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position, taking into account the inversion of characters and the cumulative sums of positions.

Correctness: **True**
