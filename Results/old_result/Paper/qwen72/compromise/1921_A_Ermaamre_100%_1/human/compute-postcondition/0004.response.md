Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four tuples of coordinates (x_i, y_i) from the input, where each tuple represents a corner of a square. The function calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the corners, and then prints the area of the square, which is the square of the side length. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and the input test cases are processed and the areas of the squares are printed. The internal variables `a`, `x`, and `dx` are overwritten in each iteration of the loop. **
