Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the square is defined by coordinates that do not have a simple max and min difference for both x and y coordinates. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
1 1
1 3
3 1
3 3
```

The expected output is `4` (since the side length of the square is `2` and the area is `2 * 2 = 4`). However, the program will output `4` as well, but it does so by only considering the x-coordinates and assuming the square's side length is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates. This assumption is incorrect because the side length should be the same for both x and y coordinates.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should check both the x and y coordinates to ensure the side length is consistent. If the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is not equal to the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates, the program should return an error or handle this case appropriately.
