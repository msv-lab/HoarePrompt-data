Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. It checks the conditions necessary to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing any number of the specified operations.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions and contents of each grid.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the first and last rows of the grid are entirely one color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because the first and last rows would remain different, and no operation can change this.
   - Similarly, if the first and last columns of the grid are entirely one color but different from each other, it is also impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

3. **General Case**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES". This is because if there are no such conflicting rows or columns, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles and applying the operations.

The program efficiently checks these conditions and outputs the correct result for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
