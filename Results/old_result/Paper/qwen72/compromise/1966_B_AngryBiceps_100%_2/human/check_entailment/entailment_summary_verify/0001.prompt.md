You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, then checks if the first or last row is entirely one color and different from each other, or if the first and last columns are entirely one color and different from each other. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function continues processing until all test cases are handled.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Grid Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions of the grid for each test case.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in a list `a`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the grid is a single row or a single column by checking the first and last elements of the first and last rows.
   - It also checks if the first and last rows are entirely the same color but different from each other, which would make it impossible to make the entire grid the same color.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if the first and last rows are entirely the same color but different from each other. If this is the case, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color.
   - It also checks if the first and last columns are entirely the same color but different from each other. If this is the case, it prints "NO" for the same reason.
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES" because it is possible to make the entire grid the same color.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The key insight is that if the first and last rows (or columns) are entirely the same color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color because any operation that changes the color of one of these rows (or columns) will not affect the other.
   - If the first and last rows (or columns) are not entirely the same color or are the same color, it is always possible to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program efficiently checks the conditions by using set operations, which are O(1) for checking the length of the set.
   - The overall complexity is O(n * m) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color after performing the allowed operations. The edge cases and main logic are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
