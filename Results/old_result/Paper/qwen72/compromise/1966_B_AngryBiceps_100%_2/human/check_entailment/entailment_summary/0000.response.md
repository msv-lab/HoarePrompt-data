Reasoning:  
The function `func` aims to determine if it is possible to make all squares in an n Ã— m grid the same color using the specified operations. The key insight is that if the first and last rows are entirely one color but different from each other, or if the first and last columns are entirely one color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. This is because any operation that changes the color of a subrectangle will always preserve the color of the boundary squares, and if the boundary squares are already different, no operation can change this.

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of test cases, the dimensions of the grid, and the grid itself.
2. **Extracting First and Last Rows/Columns**: It constructs strings `first_row` and `last_row` by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.
3. **Checking Conditions**:
   - If the first row is entirely one color and the last row is entirely a different color, print 'NO'.
   - If the first column is entirely one color and the last column is entirely a different color, print 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, print 'YES'.

The conditions checked by the function are sufficient to determine if the grid can be made uniform. If the first and last rows or columns are entirely one color but different from each other, it is impossible to make the entire grid the same color. If these conditions are not met, there is always a way to make the entire grid the same color by selecting appropriate subrectangles.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the function correctly implements the logic to determine the possibility of making the grid uniform.

Correctness: **True**
