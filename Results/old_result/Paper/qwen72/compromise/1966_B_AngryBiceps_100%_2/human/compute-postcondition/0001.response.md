Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and checks specific conditions to determine if the grid is valid. For each test case, it prints 'NO' if the first or last row is entirely one color and different from each other, or if the first and last columns are entirely one color and different from each other. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each test case, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.**
