The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition, but based on the provided constraints, it is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid represented by a list of strings. The function should accept an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it should accept two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500), and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, where the characters 'W' and 'B' represent the colors of the grid. The sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `m`, containing characters 'W' and 'B'. It processes each test case and returns a result for each, with the total number of test cases indicated by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n * m` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.**
