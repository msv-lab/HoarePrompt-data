### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if the given array `b` can form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - A progressive square is constructed such that each element \( a_{i,j} \) is calculated as \( a_{i,j} = a_{1,1} + (i-1) \cdot c + (j-1) \cdot d \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l` (the array of integers).
   - It first finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`. This minimum value is assumed to be \( a_{1,1} \).
   - It then constructs a new list `li` by calculating the values of the progressive square using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) for all \( k \) and \( h \) in the range `[0, n)`.
   - Both the original list `l` and the constructed list `li` are sorted.
   - If the sorted lists `l` and `li` are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

3. **Verification:**
   - The minimum value `a` is correctly identified as the starting point of the progressive square.
   - The construction of the list `li` using the formula \( a + k \cdot c + h \cdot d \) is correct.
   - Sorting both lists and comparing them ensures that the elements match in both frequency and value.
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately checks if the given array can form a progressive square with the specified parameters.

Correctness: **True**
