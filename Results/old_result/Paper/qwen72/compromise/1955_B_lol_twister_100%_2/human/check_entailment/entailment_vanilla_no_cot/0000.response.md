Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to check if the given array `b` can form a progressive square with the specified parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the array `l`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**:
   - The minimum element `a` in the array `l` is determined using `min(l)`. This is correct because the smallest element in the progressive square will be `a_{1,1}`.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all `k` and `h` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - These elements are stored in the list `li`.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program checks if the sorted lists are equal. If they are, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

This approach ensures that the program correctly determines whether the given array can form the specified progressive square. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program handles the constraints and requirements of the problem correctly.
