Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Minimum Value Calculation**: The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`. This is a valid approach because the smallest element in the list should correspond to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each element in the `n x n` grid. This correctly reflects the construction of the progressive square based on the given rules.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l`. It then compares these two lists to check if they are identical. If they are, it means the input list `l` can form the progressive square, and the program returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input list `l` contains duplicate values or when the values do not match the expected progressive square.

6. **Output Format**: The program outputs 'yes' or 'no' in lowercase, which is acceptable according to the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
