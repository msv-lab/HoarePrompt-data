The only variables in the loop head are `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `h` relative to `n`. If `h` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `h` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `h` must be incremented by 1 (so `h` becomes 2), and `n` must still satisfy the condition 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 2, `li` has a new element `a + k * c + d * h` appended to it.**
