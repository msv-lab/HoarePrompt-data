Output State: **`n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is `n-1`, `li` has `3n-1` elements. The first `n` elements of `li` are `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * d]`, the next `n-1` elements are `[a + (n-1) * c + d * 0, a + (n-1) * c + d * 1, a + (n-1) * c + d * 2, ..., a + (n-1) * c + d * (n-2)]`, and the last `n` elements are `[a + k * c, a + k * c + d, a + k * c + 2 * d, ..., a + k * c + (n-1) * d]`.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is the loop control variable.
- **`h`**: After the loop completes, `h` will be `n-1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n-1`.
- **`li`**: Initially, `li` has `2n-1` elements. The loop appends `n` more elements to `li`, making the total number of elements `3n-1`.
  - The first `n` elements are the arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference `d`.
  - The next `n-1` elements are another arithmetic sequence starting from `a + (n-1) * c` with a common difference `d`.
  - The last `n` elements are the result of the loop, forming an arithmetic sequence starting from `a + k * c` with a common difference `d`.
