Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 2, `li` has a new element `a + k * c + d * h` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends a new element to the list `li`. This new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. The values of `n` and `h` remain unchanged. The list `li` now contains one additional element, which is the result of the expression `a + k * c + d * h`. All other conditions from the initial state remain valid.
