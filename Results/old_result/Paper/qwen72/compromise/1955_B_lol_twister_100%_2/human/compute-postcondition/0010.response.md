The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500. At the start of the next iteration, `k` is increased by 1, so `k` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 ≤ c, d ≤ 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a list containing `n` elements `[a, a + d, a + 2 * d, ..., a + (n-1) * d]`, `k` is 1, `h` is n-1**
