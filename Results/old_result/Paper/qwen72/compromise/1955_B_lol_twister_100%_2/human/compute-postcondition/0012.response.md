The code snippet `li.append(a + k * c + d * h)` appends a new element to the list `li`. The new element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h`. Given that `h` is 0, the term `d * h` evaluates to 0, simplifying the expression to `a + k * c`.

Therefore, the new element added to the list `li` is `a + k * c`.

The values of `n` and `h` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 0, `li` has a new element `a + k * c` appended to it.**
