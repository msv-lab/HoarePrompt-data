Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**:
   - The function `func_1()` is called inside the loop `for _ in range(int(input())):` but it is not defined at the time of the call. This will result in a `NameError`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The program checks if the number of consecutive differences of 1 between the sorted pile sizes is odd or even, which is not the correct approach for this problem.
   - The correct approach involves determining the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones. If the number of odd piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input as strings and then converts them to integers, but it does not handle the input correctly. It should read the number of piles `N` and the pile sizes `nums` within the `func_1` function.

### Corrected Program:

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    odd_count = sum(1 for x in nums if x % 2 == 1)
    if odd_count % 2 == 1:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        print('Bob')

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the number of piles `N` and the pile sizes `nums`.
- **Counting Odd Piles**: It counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
- **Determining the Winner**: If the count of odd piles is odd, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.

This corrected program will correctly determine the winner based on the problem description.
