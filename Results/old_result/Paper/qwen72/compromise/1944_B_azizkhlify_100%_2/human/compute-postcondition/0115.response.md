The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` modifies the list `l` by incrementing the element at the index `a[i] - 1` by 1. Given the initial state where `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0, the value of `i` is used to access the first element of the list `a`. The element at the index `a[0] - 1` in the list `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the element at index `a[0] - 1` in list `l` is incremented by 1.**
