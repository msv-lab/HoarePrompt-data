Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n` (or the index where `re` equals `k`), `k` is `2 * k - ul`. If `k` is true, `re` is the number of elements in `a` that correspond to an index in `l` with a value of 1, and `res` is a list containing those elements from `a` in the order they were encountered. If `k` is false, `i` remains `n`, and `re`, `res`, and `ul` are unchanged.***
