Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `i` is the last element in `res`, `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, `ul` and `ur` are as previously defined, and `r[a[i] - 1]` for the last processed `i` is set to 0 if `ul != ur`. If `ul == ur`, the loop breaks.**
