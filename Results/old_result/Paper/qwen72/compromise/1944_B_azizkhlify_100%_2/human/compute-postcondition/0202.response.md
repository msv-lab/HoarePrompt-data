Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`. If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most immediate loop or if statement it is within. The values of `n`, `i`, `r`, `a`, and `ur` are not changed by the `break` statement, so the initial conditions remain valid.
