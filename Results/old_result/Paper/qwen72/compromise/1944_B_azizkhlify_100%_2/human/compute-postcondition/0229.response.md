The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1. Given that `i` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 0, the index `a[n] - 1` is incremented by 1 in the list `r`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
