To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which the `print` statement is executed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is the last element in `res` + 2.
- `k` is `2 * k - ul`.
- `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless the condition `ul == ur` is met.
- If `ul == ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.
- Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 2.
- If `r[a[i] - 1]` is not 2, `r[a[i] - 1]` remains 0, and `ur` is incremented by 2.

### Analysis:
1. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is the last element in `res` + 2. Since `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated, `i` is a specific integer value that is 2 more than the last element in `res`.

2. **`a[i]`**: The variable `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is referenced in the `print` statement. We can infer that `a` is a list, and `a[i]` is the element at index `i` of this list. Since `i` is a specific integer value, `a[i]` will be the element at that index in the list `a`.

3. **`end=' '`**: The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function means that the output will not end with a newline but with a space.

### Print Statement:
```
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

This statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

### Output:
Since `a[i]` is the element at index `i` of the list `a`, and `i` is a specific integer value (last element in `res` + 2), the output will be:

Output: **[a[i]] [a[i]] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is the last element in res + 2)**
