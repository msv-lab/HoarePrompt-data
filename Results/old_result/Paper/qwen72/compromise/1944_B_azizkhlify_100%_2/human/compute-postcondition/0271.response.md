To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `res` remains unchanged.
- `re` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is explicitly given as 1.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, we can infer that `a` must have at least 2 elements. The exact values of the elements in `a` are not provided.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement will print the element at index 1 of the list `a` (i.e., `a[1]`) and will not move to a new line after printing (due to `end=' '`).

### Output:
Since the exact value of `a[1]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
