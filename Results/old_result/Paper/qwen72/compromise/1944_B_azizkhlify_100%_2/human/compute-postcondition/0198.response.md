Let's break down the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**:
   - `n` is greater than 1. This means `n` is at least 2.

2. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is at least 2, `i` will be at least 3.

3. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, the code snippet attempts to access `a[i]`, which implies that `a` must have at least `i + 1` elements (since list indices are 0-based).

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is at least 3, the code will attempt to print the element at index 3 of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.
- Without knowing the exact values in the list `a`, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i in the list a, and i is n + 1, with n being greater than 1)**
