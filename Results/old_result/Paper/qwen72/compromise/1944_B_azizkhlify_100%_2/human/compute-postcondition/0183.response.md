To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context in which the statement is executed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is the second element in `res`.
- `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is 0 if `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2 for any `j` in the range `[0, n-1]`, and each other element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`.
- `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1.
- `res` is a non-empty list containing the elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k` (if the loop did not break early).
- `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l` before the loop started.
- `ur` is 0.
- `re` is the number of elements appended to `res` (which is equal to `k` if the loop did not break early).
- `k` is `2 * k - ul` and the current value of `k` is non-zero. If `k` is zero, the state of `res`, `re`, and `k` remains unchanged.

### Analysis:
1. **List `l`**:
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` is the count of occurrences of `a[j]` in the list `a`, unless `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2, in which case it is set to 0.

2. **List `r`**:
   - `r` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` for `j` from `n` to `2 * n - 1` is incremented by 1. This means that for each element in the second half of `a`, the corresponding index in `r` is incremented.

3. **List `res`**:
   - `res` contains elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l` up to the point where `re` equals `k`.
   - `re` is the number of elements appended to `res`.

4. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is the second element in `res`.

5. **Variable `k`**:
   - `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, where `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` that had a count of 2 in `l`.

### What is printed:
- The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `res`.

### Explanation:
- Since `res` contains elements from `a` that had a count of 1 in `l`, and `i` is the second element in `res`, the output will be the second element of `res`.

### Final Output:
Output: **i (where i is the second element in the list `res`)**
