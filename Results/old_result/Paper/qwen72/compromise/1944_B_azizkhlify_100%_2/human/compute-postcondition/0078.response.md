Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `i` is the next element in `res`.
   - `k` is calculated as `2 * k - ul`.
   - `res` is a non-empty list with at least one more element.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement is printing the value of `i` with a space as the end character, meaning it will not move to a new line after printing `i`.
   - `i` is the next element in the list `res`. Since `res` is a non-empty list with at least one more element, `i` will be the next element in the list when the `print` statement is executed.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the value of `i` followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where i is the next element in the list res)**
