Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2.
- `res` remains unchanged but has a new element `a[1]` appended to it if `l[a[1] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged.
- `re` is increased by 1 if `l[a[1] - 1] == 1`, otherwise `re` remains unchanged.
- If `re` equals `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**: The initial state specifies that `i` is 2.
2. **Value of `a[i]`**: The initial state does not provide the explicit value of `a[i]`. However, it is clear that `a` is a list and `a[i]` refers to the element at index 2 of the list `a`.

Since the initial state does not provide the explicit value of `a[2]`, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

### Output:
The code prints the element at index 2 of the list `a` followed by a space.
Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the element at index 2 of the list `a`)**
