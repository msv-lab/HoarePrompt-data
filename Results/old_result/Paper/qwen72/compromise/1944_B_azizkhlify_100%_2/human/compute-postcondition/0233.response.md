Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is `n + 2`.
- The value of `n` is still greater than 1.
- The values of `l[a[j] - 1]` for each `j` from 0 to `n-1` are still incremented by 1.
- The values of `r[a[n] - 1]` and `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` are still incremented by 1.
- The value of `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is incremented by 1 due to the execution of the code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] += 1`.
