Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def find_subarrays(a, n, k):` where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The list `a` contains each integer from 1 to n exactly twice.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element in `res`, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, and `res` is a non-empty list that has been fully iterated. If `ul != ur`, `r[a[i] - 1]` for the last processed `i` is set to 0, and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each `a[i]` where `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2. If `ul == ur`, the loop breaks, and `r[a[i] - 1]` for the last processed `i` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *The loop has finished executing, and all elements in `res` have been printed, one after another, separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `l`, `r`, `ul`, `ur`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states, except if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, in which case all elements in `res` that meet the condition `r[a[i] - 1] == 2` have been printed, each element printed twice, separated by spaces, and `ur` may have been increased by 2 for each element in `a` that met this condition within the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`. The loop breaks if `ul` equals `ur` at any point during execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`res` is a list with all elements that satisfy `l[a[j] - 1] == 1` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, and `i` has iterated through all elements in `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and for each element `a[k]` where `k` ranges from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, if `r[a[k] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[k] - 1]` is now 0, and `ur` is increased by 2 for each such element. If `ul` becomes equal to `ur` at any point during the loop, the loop breaks and the final state is `i` is the value of `k` where `ul` became equal to `ur` minus 1. Otherwise, `i` remains `2 * n - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
