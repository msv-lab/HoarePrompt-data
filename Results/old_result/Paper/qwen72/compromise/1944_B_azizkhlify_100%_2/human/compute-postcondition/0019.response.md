Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n + 2`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` by 1. Since `i` is `n + 2`, the expression `a[i] - 1` becomes `a[n + 2] - 1`. Therefore, `r[a[n + 2] - 1]` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is already incremented by 1, and this remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `i` also remain the same.
