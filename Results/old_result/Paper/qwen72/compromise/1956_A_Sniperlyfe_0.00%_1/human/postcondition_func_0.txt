The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and a sorted list of integers `p` where each element is between 1 and 100. It modifies `n` by repeatedly subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`. The function then returns `n`, which is a non-negative integer that is less than the smallest element in `p`. The list `p` remains unchanged.
