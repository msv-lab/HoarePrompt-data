Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it handles the output for each test case. Specifically, the `res` list is being printed inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`. This means that the results for each `n` are printed prematurely, and the final output for each test case is not complete.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 3
  3 5
  5 6 7
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2 1 2
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  2
  2 1
  2 1 2
  ```

The actual output is incorrect because the results are printed prematurely, leading to multiple lines of output instead of a single line for each test case. The correct approach would be to accumulate all results in `res` and print them at the end of each test case.
