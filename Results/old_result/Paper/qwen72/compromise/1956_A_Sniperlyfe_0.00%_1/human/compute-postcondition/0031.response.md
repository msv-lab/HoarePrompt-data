The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, and `_` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `_`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`**
