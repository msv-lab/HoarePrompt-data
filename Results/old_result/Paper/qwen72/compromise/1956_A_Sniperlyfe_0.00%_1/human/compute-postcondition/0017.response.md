Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they were processed.**

The code snippet `k, q = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of `k` and `q` based on user input. The values of `k` and `q` are now specific integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `p`, `qs`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
