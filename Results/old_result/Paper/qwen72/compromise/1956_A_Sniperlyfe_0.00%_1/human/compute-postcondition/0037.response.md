Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `n` is the first element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains greater than 2.
- The value of `_` remains 3.
- `k` and `q` remain input integers.
- `p` remains a list of integers provided by the user.
- `qs` remains a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element.
- `n` remains the first element in `qs`.
- `res` is updated to contain the result of `func_1(n, p)`, which is the first element of `qs` passed through `func_1` with the list `p`.
