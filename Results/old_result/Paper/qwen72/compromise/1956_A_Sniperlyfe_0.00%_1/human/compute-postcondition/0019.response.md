Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they were processed.**

Explanation:
- The code `qs = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `qs` to be a list of integers provided by the user.
- The initial state specifies that `n` is the last element in `qs`, which remains valid after the code execution.
- The variable `res` is still a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, but the specific values in `res` would depend on the new values in `qs` and the function `func_1`.
- All other initial conditions (`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user) remain unchanged.
