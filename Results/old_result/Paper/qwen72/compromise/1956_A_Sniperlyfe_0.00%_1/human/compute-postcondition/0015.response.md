Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they were processed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variables `k` and `q` remain as the input integers they were initially.
- The list `p` remains unchanged as the list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `qs` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop performed.
- The variable `n` is the last element in `qs` that was processed by the loop.
- The list `res` contains the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, in the order they were processed.
