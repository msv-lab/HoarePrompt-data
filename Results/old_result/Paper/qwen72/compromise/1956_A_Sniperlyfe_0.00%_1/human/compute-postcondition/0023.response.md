Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `k` and `q` are input integers.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 1 element.
   - `n` is the first element in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the elements of the list `res` as a string, with each element separated by a space.
   - `res` is a list that contains the result of the function `func_1(n, p)`.
   - Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact values of the elements in `res`. However, we know that `res` is a list of integers or values that can be converted to strings.

4. **Output:**
   - The output will be a string where each element of `res` is converted to a string and separated by a space.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements in `res`.

Output: **' '.join(map(str, res)) (where res is the list containing the result of func_1(n, p))**
