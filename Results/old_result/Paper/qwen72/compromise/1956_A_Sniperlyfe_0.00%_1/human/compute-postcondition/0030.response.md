Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations:
- The variable `t` must still be greater than 1.
- The variable `_` remains 2.
- The variables `k` and `q` remain as the input integers provided.
- The list `p` remains unchanged as the list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `qs` remains unchanged as the list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `n` is the last element in `qs`.
- The list `res` now contains the results of the function `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, in the order they were processed.
