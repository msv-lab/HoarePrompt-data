Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 1, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `n` is the third element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `_` remains 1.
- The values of `k` and `q` remain as input integers.
- The list `p` remains a list of integers provided by the user.
- The list `qs` remains a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements.
- The value of `n` remains the third element in `qs`.
- The list `res` now contains the original result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it. The new result is the same as the original result because `func_1(n, p)` is called again with the same arguments.
