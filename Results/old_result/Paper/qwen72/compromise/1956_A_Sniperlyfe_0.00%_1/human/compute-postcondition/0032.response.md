Output State: **`t` must be greater than 2, `_` is 3, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`**

Explanation:
- `k` and `q` are now assigned the values of two integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `p`, `qs`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- `n` is still the last element in `qs`.
- `res` still contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`.
