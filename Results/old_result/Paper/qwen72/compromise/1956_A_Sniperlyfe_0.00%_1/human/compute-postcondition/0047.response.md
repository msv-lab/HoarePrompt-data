The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 250.
- `k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100.
- `p` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 <= p[i] <= 100 and p[i] < p[i+1] for all 0 <= i < k-1.
- `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q.

The function returns a list of results based on the input parameters. However, the specific output based on these parameters is not provided in the example. Given the constraints and relationships, the function likely processes the lists `p` and `qs` in some way, possibly to determine if elements in `qs` are present in `p` or to perform some other operation involving the elements of these lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`. It processes the lists `p` and `qs` and returns a list of results based on the input parameters.**
