To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `k` and `q` are input integers (though they are not used in the code snippet).
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements.
   - `n` is the second element in `qs`.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `res` list contains two elements: the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the same result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string using `map(str, res)` and then joins these strings with a space in between using `' '.join()`.
   - Therefore, the output will be the string representation of the result of `func_1(n, p)` repeated twice, separated by a space.

4. **Output:**
   - Since the exact values of `p` and `n` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - However, we know that `res` will contain two identical elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **result result (where result is the result of `func_1(n, p)`)**
