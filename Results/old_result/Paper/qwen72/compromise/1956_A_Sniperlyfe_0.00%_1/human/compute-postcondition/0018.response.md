Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 2, `k` and `q` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `n` is the last element in `qs`, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they were processed.**

Explanation:
- The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `p`.
- The initial state specifies that `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, which is now updated to reflect the new list of integers from the input.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `q`, `qs`, `n`, and `res` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
