### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - Rearranging the elements of the array can help achieve this maximum beauty.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).
   - The array \(a\) is then sorted.
   - The program calculates the beauty by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, up to the middle of the array.

3. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array is a key step because it ensures that the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) are maximized when the elements are paired in this manner.
   - By sorting, the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, which maximizes the positive differences.

4. **Calculating the Beauty**:
   - The program iterates through the first half of the sorted array and calculates the differences between the corresponding largest and smallest elements.
   - This is done by summing \(a[n-i-1] - a[i]\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\).

5. **Output**:
   - The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., [69, 69, 69]) correctly, as the beauty will be 0.
   - It also handles the case where the array has an odd number of elements correctly, as it only iterates up to the middle of the array.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The approach of sorting the array and then summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs is correct. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
  - The formula \(a[n-i-1] - a[i]\) for \(i\) from 0 to \(\frac{n}{2} - 1\) is the correct way to calculate the maximum beauty.

- **Implementation Details**:
  - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads the length \(n\) and the elements of the array \(a\).
  - It sorts the array \(a\).
  - It initializes the variable `kq` to 0 to store the sum of the differences.
  - The loop iterates through the first half of the sorted array, correctly calculating the differences and summing them up.
  - The result is printed for each test case.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles arrays with all elements being the same, resulting in a beauty of 0.
  - It also handles arrays with an odd number of elements by only iterating up to the middle of the array, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements. The approach is sound, and the implementation matches the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
