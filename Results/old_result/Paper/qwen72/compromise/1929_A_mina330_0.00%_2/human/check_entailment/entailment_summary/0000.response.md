### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. 

Given that the elements can be rearranged in any way, the optimal strategy is to sort the array and then pair the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This way, the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) will be maximized because the largest elements are subtracted from the smallest elements.

However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements of the first half of the sorted list. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted array.

The correct approach should be to calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array, which can be done by iterating through the sorted list and summing up \((a[i] - a[i-1])\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\).

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. It only sums the differences between the largest and smallest elements of the first half of the sorted list, which is not the correct way to maximize the beauty. The correct way is to sum the differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted array.
