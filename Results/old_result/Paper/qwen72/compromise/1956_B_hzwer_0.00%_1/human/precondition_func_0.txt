The function should accept multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the cards in your hand. The integer n represents the number of cards each player receives, and each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list. The total number of test cases t is given, with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
