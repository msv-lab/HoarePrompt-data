Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 2`, and `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 3` and `j` is `n - 2`, so `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`. The other values and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
