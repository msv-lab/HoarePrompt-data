Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` which is 0 and `dp[n - 2][0]` which is now 0, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
    elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
    else:
        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, and `j` is `n - 1`. If the integer `j + 1` does not appear in the list `cards`, then `dp[i][j]` is equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`. If the integer `j + 1` appears exactly once in the `cards` list, then `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to `max(dp[n - 2][n - 1], dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1)`. If the integer `j + 1` appears at least twice in the `cards` list, then `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 2] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, and `j` is `n - 2`. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to 0. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to the maximum value between `dp[n - 2][n - 2]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`. If `cards.count(j + 1) > 1`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 2]` is set to the maximum value among `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 3] + 1`, `dp[n - 1][n - 2]`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `j` is `n - 3`, and `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 0`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` remains 0. If `cards.count(j + 1) == 1`, then `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[n - 2][n - 3]` and `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[n - 3][n - 3]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[n - 2][n - 3]`, `dp[n - 1][n - 4] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][n - 2]`. The total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
