Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except for the values that have been updated by the loop. `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, and `j` is `0`. For each `j` from `n - 1` to `0` (inclusive), if the count of the value `j + 1` in the list `cards` is 0, `dp[n - 3][j]` is equal to `dp[n - 2][j]`. If `cards` contains exactly one occurrence of `j + 1`, `dp[n - 3][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][j]` and `dp[n - 1][j - 1] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[n - 3][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][j]`, `dp[n - 1][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][j + 1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `dp` remains a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1).
- The loop has updated the values in the row `i = n - 3` for all columns `j` from `n - 1` down to `0`.
- For each column `j` in this row, the value `dp[n - 3][j]` is determined based on the count of the value `j + 1` in the list `cards`:
  - If `j + 1` is not present in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][j]` is set to the value of `dp[n - 2][j]`.
  - If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][j]` and `dp[n - 1][j - 1] + 1`.
  - If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[n - 3][j]` is set to the maximum of `dp[n - 2][j]`, `dp[n - 1][j - 1] + 1`, and `dp[n - 2][j + 1]`.
- The variable `i` remains `n - 3`, and the variable `j` is now `0`.
