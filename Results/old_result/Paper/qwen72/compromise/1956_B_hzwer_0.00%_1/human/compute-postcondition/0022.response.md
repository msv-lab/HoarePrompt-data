To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions given:

### Loop Head Analysis
The loop head is:
```python
for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
```
This loop iterates over `j` starting from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time.

### Current State
- `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is `n - 3`.
- `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `j` is `n - 2`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `0`.
2. **Current Value of `j`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `n - 2`.
3. **Next Value of `j`**: For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be decremented by 1, so the next value of `j` will be `n - 3`.

### Adjusted State
- `j` is now `n - 3`.
- All other variables (`dp`, `n`, `i`, `cards`, and `t`) remain unchanged because they are not part of the loop head.

### Final State
State: **`dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n + 1) x (n + 1), where each element is initialized to 0 except `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` which are 0, `n` is at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`, `cards` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the total number of test cases `t` is given with 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `j` is `n - 3`.**
