Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. The issue lies in the dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the `func_1` function. The DP table is not correctly initialized and the transitions are not correctly formulated to solve the problem as described.

### Explanation:

1. **DP Table Initialization**:
   - The DP table `dp` is initialized with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`, but the initial values are not set correctly. The values `dp[n - 1][0] = 0` and `dp[n - 2][0] = 0` are not necessary and do not contribute to the solution.

2. **DP Transitions**:
   - The transitions in the DP table are not correctly capturing the game dynamics. The program assumes that the number of cards with a particular integer can be 0, 1, or 2, but it does not handle the optimal play strategy correctly.
   - The program does not consider the optimal moves for Nene, which is crucial for determining the maximum points you can score.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves understanding that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. This can be handled by a greedy strategy where you try to play cards that Nene cannot match immediately, and Nene will always play cards that you cannot match immediately.
   - A correct solution would involve counting the occurrences of each card in your hand and using a greedy strategy to determine the maximum points you can score.

### Correct Solution:

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def max_points():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
        count = [0] * (n + 1)
        for card in cards:
            count[card] += 1
        points = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if count[i] == 2:
                points += 1
        results.append(points)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

max_points()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **Counting Cards**:
   - We count the occurrences of each card in your hand using the `count` array.

2. **Calculating Points**:
   - For each card integer `i` from 1 to `n`, if you have both cards (i.e., `count[i] == 2`), you can score 1 point by playing both cards. This is because Nene will not be able to match the first card you play, but she will match the second card, and you will score a point for the first card.

3. **Output**:
   - The program collects the results for each test case and prints them at the end.

This approach ensures that you maximize your points by playing cards that Nene cannot immediately match, which is the optimal strategy given the problem constraints.
