### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the first line and the list of ticket prices `M` from the second line.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The function ensures that `m` is not greater than `k` by setting `m = min(m, k)`. This is necessary because you cannot buy more tickets in a day than you need in total.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The function sorts the list of ticket prices `M` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows the algorithm to purchase tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

4. **Calculating the Number of Days to Purchase:**
   - The function calculates `q` as the ceiling of `k / m`. This determines the minimum number of days required to purchase all `k` tickets, given that you can buy at most `m` tickets per day.

5. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to purchase tickets. This ensures that the tickets are bought on the days with the lowest prices.

6. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n * m == k`, it means that the number of tickets to be bought is exactly divisible by the number of tickets that can be bought per day. In this case, the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`, where `N` is the list of the first `q` days' prices.
   - If `n * m != k`, it means that there are some remaining tickets to be bought after purchasing `m` tickets on each of the first `n-1` days. The function calculates the cost for the remaining tickets and adds it to the total cost.

7. **Handling Remaining Tickets:**
   - The function correctly handles the remaining tickets by popping the last element from `N` and calculating the cost for the remaining tickets `mu` on the last day.

8. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Correctness:
The program appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. However, there is a potential issue in the cost calculation for the remaining tickets. The formula used to calculate the cost for the remaining tickets might be incorrect. Specifically, the term `n * m * mu` seems to be an overcompensation and might not be necessary.

### Corrected Cost Calculation:
- If `n * m == k`, the cost is correctly calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
- If `n * m != k`, the cost should be calculated as:
  - `mu * w` for the remaining tickets on the last day.
  - `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` for the tickets bought on the first `n-1` days.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the cost calculation for the remaining tickets. The term `n * m * mu` is not necessary and should be removed. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (n, m, k) = (L[0], L[1], L[2])
        m = min(m, k)
        M.sort()
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        N = M[:q]
        n = len(N)
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        print(cost)
        continue
```

This corrected version should produce the correct output for all test cases.
