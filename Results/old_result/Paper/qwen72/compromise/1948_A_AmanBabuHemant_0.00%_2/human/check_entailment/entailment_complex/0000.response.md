Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it's impossible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters, as special characters must come in pairs (each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors). Therefore, it prints 'NO' for odd `n`.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the function constructs a string `s` by repeating the pattern '110' `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every '1' in the string is a special character (since each '1' is equal to exactly one of its neighbors).

4. **String Length Check**: The function checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string. If the length of `s` is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because the problem guarantees that if a solution exists, there is one of length at most 200.

5. **Output Format**: The function adheres to the required output format, printing 'NO' for invalid cases and 'YES' followed by the string for valid cases.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases, such as `n = 1` (which is odd and thus should print 'NO') and `n = 2` (which is even and should print a valid string like 'MM').

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
