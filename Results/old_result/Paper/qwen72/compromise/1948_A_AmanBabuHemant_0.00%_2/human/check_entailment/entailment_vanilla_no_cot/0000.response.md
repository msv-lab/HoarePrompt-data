Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not generate a string of uppercase Latin letters as required by the problem statement. Instead, it generates a string of '1's and '0's, which does not meet the criteria of having special characters that are equal to exactly one of their neighbors. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n` is even but the generated string length exceeds 200, which is a requirement for the output.

To fix this, the program should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters and ensure that the length of the string does not exceed 200. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) <= 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version generates a string of uppercase Latin letters and ensures that the length of the string is at most 200. It also correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO'.
