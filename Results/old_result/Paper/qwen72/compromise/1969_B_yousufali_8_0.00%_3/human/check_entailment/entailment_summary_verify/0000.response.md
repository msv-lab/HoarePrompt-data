### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing Issue**:
   - The function `func_1` uses `input().split()` to read the binary string `s`. This is incorrect because `input().split()` splits the input string by whitespace, which is not the intended behavior for a binary string. Instead, the function should read the input as a single string using `input()` and convert it to a list of integers using a list comprehension or similar method.
   - The correct way to read the binary string `s` would be:
     ```python
     s = list(map(int, input()))
     ```

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the minimum cost to sort the string by counting the number of 1s and adding to the cost when a 0 is encountered after a 1. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the cyclic nature of the shifts.
   - The correct approach to calculate the minimum cost involves identifying the positions where the string needs to be shifted to become sorted. Specifically, you need to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all 1s to the end of the string.
   - The function should count the number of 0s before the first 1 and the number of 1s after the last 0, and then calculate the minimum cost based on these counts.

3. **Handling Already Sorted Strings**:
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For a string that is already sorted, the cost should be 0. The function should check if the string is already sorted and return 0 if it is.

### Corrected Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input()))
    n = len(s)
    ans = 0
    count_1 = s.count(1)
    count_0 = s.count(0)
    
    if count_1 == 0 or count_0 == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 1:
            cost = i + 1 + (n - i - count_1)
            min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    print(min_cost)
```

### Corrected Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Reading the Input**: `s = list(map(int, input()))` correctly reads the binary string and converts it to a list of integers.
- **Counting 1s and 0s**: `count_1 = s.count(1)` and `count_0 = s.count(0)` count the number of 1s and 0s in the string.
- **Handling Already Sorted Strings**: If the string contains only 0s or only 1s, the cost is 0.
- **Calculating Minimum Cost**: For each position `i` where `s[i] == 1`, the cost to shift the substring from the start to `i` and from `i` to the end is calculated. The minimum of these costs is then printed.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is **accurate**. The provided program does not correctly handle the input and output requirements and does not implement the correct logic to find the minimum cost to sort the string.
- The corrected code addresses these issues and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Final: **False**
