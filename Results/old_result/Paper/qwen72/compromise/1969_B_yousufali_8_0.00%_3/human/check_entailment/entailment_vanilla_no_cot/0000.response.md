Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for the following reasons:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function `func_1` is incorrectly parsing the input. It expects a list of integers, but the input is a binary string. The correct way to parse the input would be to read the string directly and then convert it to a list of integers if needed.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string. The current logic increments `ans` by `n + 1` whenever it encounters a `0` after a `1`, but this does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to sort the string.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases, but it calls `func_1` which is incorrect.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

- **Count the Number of 1s and 0s**: Determine the number of `1`s and `0`s in the string.
- **Find the Optimal Cyclic Shift**: The optimal way to sort the string is to find the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to group all `1`s to the right and all `0`s to the left. This can be done by finding the longest contiguous segment of `1`s and `0`s and then calculating the cost based on the length of the string and the segment.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    cost = 0
    max_segment = 0
    current_segment = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            current_segment += 1
        else:
            max_segment = max(max_segment, current_segment)
            current_segment = 0
    
    max_segment = max(max_segment, current_segment)
    cost = n - max_segment
    return cost

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

# Example usage
func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`min_cost_to_sort(s)`**: This function calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
  - It iterates through the string to find the longest segment of `1`s.
  - The cost is then calculated as the length of the string minus the length of the longest segment of `1`s.
- **`func_2()`**: This function handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and then calling `min_cost_to_sort` for each test case.

This corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
