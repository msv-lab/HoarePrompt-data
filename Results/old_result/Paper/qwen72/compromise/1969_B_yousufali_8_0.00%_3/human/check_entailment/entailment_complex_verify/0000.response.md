### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing Issue**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` reads the input using `input().split()`, which is intended to split a string by whitespace and convert the resulting substrings into integers. However, the input is a binary string without any whitespace. This means that `input().split()` will return a list containing a single string, and `list(map(int, input().split()))` will attempt to convert that single string into an integer, which will fail for strings longer than one character.
   - The correct way to parse the input is to read it as a string and then convert each character to an integer, which can be done using `list(map(int, input().strip()))`.

2. **Logic for Cost Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to calculate the cost to sort the string by counting the number of '1's (`n`) and adding `n + 1` to the answer (`ans`) for each '0' that follows at least one '1'.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not correctly account for the minimum cost to sort the string. The correct approach should involve finding the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move all '1's to the end of the string, which can be done by identifying the position of the first '0' that follows a '1' and calculating the cost based on the length of the substring from that position to the end of the string.

3. **Handling Already Sorted Strings**:
   - The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the string is already sorted. For a sorted string, the cost should be 0, but the current logic will still add `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1', which is incorrect.

4. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `10`, the function will incorrectly parse it and fail to produce the correct output.
   - For the input `0000`, the function will incorrectly parse it and fail to produce the correct output.
   - For the input `11000`, the function will incorrectly parse it and fail to produce the correct output.
   - For the input `101011`, the function will incorrectly parse it and fail to produce the correct output.
   - For the input `01101001`, the function will incorrectly parse it and fail to produce the correct output.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the input and output requirements, and it does not implement the correct logic to find the minimum cost to sort the string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
