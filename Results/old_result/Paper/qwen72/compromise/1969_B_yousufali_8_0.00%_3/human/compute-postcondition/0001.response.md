The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since no variables are passed to the function `func_2`, and `t` is an input integer, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
