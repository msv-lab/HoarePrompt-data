Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the variables `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` will have been updated as follows: `n` will be the input integer for that test case, `g` will remain 0, `v1` will be the largest integer in the range [1, n-1] such that the response from the input is '<', and `prev` will be the integer that satisfies the conditions of the second and third queries in the loop. After all iterations, the loop will have printed the result `! {prev} {v1}` for each test case.**
