You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates within an interactive environment where a secret permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1 is provided, and the function can make at most 3n queries to find the indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The input n is a positive integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), and the total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) with the sum of n over all test cases not exceeding 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
            elif r == '=':
                print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')
                sys.stdout.flush()
                r2 = input('')
                if r2 == '<':
                    prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the variables `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` will have been updated as follows: `n` will be the input integer for that test case, `g` will remain 0, `v1` will be the largest integer in the range [1, n-1] such that the response from the input is '<', and `prev` will be the integer that satisfies the conditions of the second and third queries in the loop. After all iterations, the loop will have printed the result `! {prev} {v1}` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates within an interactive environment to find the indices `i` and `j` in a secret permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. It can make at most 3n queries and handles multiple test cases, ensuring the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
