The only objects in the loop head are the variable `kp` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be a positive integer. Before the loop starts, the state indicates that the total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). Therefore, the input to the loop should be `t`.

State: **`I` is a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers, `R` is a lambda function that reads an integer input, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), `kp` is 0, and `int(input())` must be `t`**
