The code snippet `x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to `x` and `n` respectively. The initial values of `t`, `x`, and `n` are not affected by this operation, but the values of `x` and `n` are updated to the new input values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` and `n` are integers provided by the user input, and 1 <= n <= x.**
