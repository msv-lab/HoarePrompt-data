You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined structure, not as direct function parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), the second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and the third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations for all test cases. `t` is 0, indicating no more test cases to process. `i` is the total number of test cases processed, which is the initial value of `t`. `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the final values after the last test case has been processed, which could be 0 or some other value depending on the input. `p` and `a` are lists that have been processed and are in their final state after the last test case. `sp` and `bp` are the sums of the values from the `a` list at the indices `s` and `b` respectively, accumulated over all iterations of the last test case. `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values of the expressions `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` respectively, computed over all iterations of the last test case. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the program has printed 'Bodya' for the last test case. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the program has printed 'Sasha' for the last test case. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the program has printed 'Draw' for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` (where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), the second line contains `n` integers `p_1, ..., p_n` (where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and the third line contains `n` integers `a_1, ..., a_n` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case by adjusting the values of `b` and `s` based on the `p` list and calculates the maximum possible values of two expressions involving elements from the `a` list. After processing, it prints 'Bodya' if the first expression is greater, 'Sasha' if the second expression is greater, or 'Draw' if they are equal. The function continues processing until all test cases are completed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and positions of the players. According to the problem, the score should be updated at the beginning of each turn, and then the player can either stay or move to the position specified by the permutation. However, the program updates the scores and positions in a way that does not match this logic.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
The expected output should be:
```
Bodya
```
However, the program will produce an incorrect output. The issue lies in the way the program updates the scores and positions. The program incorrectly decrements `k` and updates the scores and positions in a loop that does not accurately simulate the game's rules. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where a player can choose to stay at their current position, and it incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores for each player.

To correctly simulate the game, the program should:
1. Initialize the scores of both players.
2. For each turn, update the scores based on the current positions.
3. Allow each player to either stay or move to the position specified by the permutation.
4. Compare the final scores after `k` turns to determine the winner.

The current implementation does not follow these steps accurately, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
