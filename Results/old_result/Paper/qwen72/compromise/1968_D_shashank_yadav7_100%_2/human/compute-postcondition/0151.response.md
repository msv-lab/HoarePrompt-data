The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state describes a complex set of conditions and variable transformations, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'Draw'`.

Therefore, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm`, the `print` statement will always output the same string.

Output: **Draw**
