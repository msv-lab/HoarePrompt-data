Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but reads multiple test cases from standard input or a predefined structure. Each test case consists of: the first line containing four integers n, k, P_B, P_S (where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), the second line containing n integers p_1, ..., p_n (where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and the third line containing n integers a_1, ..., a_n (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
