The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the implied condition that `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. The state of `i` needs to be adjusted as it is the loop counter, and `n` must remain unchanged to ensure the loop condition is met.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i` (which will be 1).

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 1` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`**. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
