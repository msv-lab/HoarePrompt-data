Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is an input integer minus 1, `b` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is the integer value at index `b` in the list `a` multiplied by `k` (which is now an input integer minus 2), `sm` is the integer value at index `s` in the list `a` multiplied by `k` (which is now an input integer minus 2).**
