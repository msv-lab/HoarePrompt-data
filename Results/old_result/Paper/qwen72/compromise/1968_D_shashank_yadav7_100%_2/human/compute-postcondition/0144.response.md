Output State: **The loop executes fully if `n` is greater than 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. In this case, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k - n`, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed `n` times, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed `n` times, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` taken `n` times, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` taken `n` times, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k - j) + bp` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k - j) + sp` for `j` from 0 to `n-1`. If `k` becomes 0 before the loop completes, `i` is the value at which `k` became 0 plus 1, `k` is 0, `b` and `s` are the values at the time `k` became 0, `sp` and `bp` are the sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` taken `i` times, and `bm` and `sm` are the maximum values of `a[b] * (k - j) + bp` and `a[s] * (k - j) + sp` for `j` from 0 to `i-1` respectively.**

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all iterations:
- If the loop runs to completion (i.e., `k` is greater than or equal to `n`), `i` will be `n`, `k` will be `k - n`, and `b` and `s` will be the final values after `n` updates.
- If the loop breaks early because `k` becomes 0, `i` will be the value at which `k` became 0 plus 1, `k` will be 0, and `b` and `s` will be the values at the time `k` became 0.
- `sp` and `bp` will be the sums of `a[s]` and `a[b]` taken `n` times (or `i` times if the loop breaks early).
- `bm` and `sm` will be the maximum values of the expressions `a[b] * (k - j) + bp` and `a[s] * (k - j) + sp` for each iteration `j` from 0 to `n-1` (or `i-1` if the loop breaks early).
