Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
