Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - 1` if `k` was not 0, otherwise `k` is 0, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is `max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged; `s` is now `p[s] - 1`; `bm` is now `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`; `sm` is now `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * k + sp)` if `k` is not 0, otherwise all variables remain unchanged and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; `bp` is now `bp + a[b]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: If `k` is 0, `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `a`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is not 0, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`, and `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, and `a` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
