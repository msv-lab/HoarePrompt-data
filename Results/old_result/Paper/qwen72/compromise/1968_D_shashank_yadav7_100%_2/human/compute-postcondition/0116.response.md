Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, minus 1, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, minus 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the value of `a[s]`, `bp` is the value of `a[b]`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * (k + 1)`, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
