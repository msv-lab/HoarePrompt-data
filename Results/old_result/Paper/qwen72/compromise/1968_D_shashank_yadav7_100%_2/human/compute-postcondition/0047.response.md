Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is the initial input integer minus `n`.
- `b` is the final value of `p[b] - 1` after `n` iterations.
- `s` is the final value of `p[s] - 1` after `n` iterations.
- `p` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `sp` is the sum of the initial value at index `s` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[s] - 1` for each iteration.
- `bp` is the sum of the initial value at index `b` in `a` and all subsequent values at indices `p[b] - 1` for each iteration.
- `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration.
- `bm` is less than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Sasha'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their values, but none of this information is used in the `print` statement itself.
- The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state.

### Conclusion:
The code will print the string `'Sasha'`.

Output: **Sasha**
