Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `k` was greater than 0 initially and the loop executed fully, otherwise `i` is the value at the time `k` became 0 plus 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `k` is 0 if the loop executed fully or the value at the time `k` became 0, `b` is the final value of `b` after `b = p[b] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, `s` is the final value of `s` after `s = p[s] - 1` was executed as many times as the loop ran, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `sp` is the sum of the initial `sp` and all values of `a[s]` added during the loop, `bp` is the sum of the initial `bp` and all values of `a[b]` added during the loop, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` computed during the loop, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` computed during the loop, `n` is updated to an input integer, `k` is updated to an input integer, `b` is updated to an input integer, `s` is updated to an input integer, `p` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `a`.
- The initial state information about `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, `sm`, and `p` remains unchanged.
- The only variable that is updated is `a`, which now holds the list of integers input by the user.
