The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined structure, not as direct function parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), the second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n), and the third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
