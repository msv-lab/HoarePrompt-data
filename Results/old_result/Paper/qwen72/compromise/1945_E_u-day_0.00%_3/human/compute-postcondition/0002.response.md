Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned new values by `func_1()`, `arr` is a list of integers returned by `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1.**

The variable `pos` is explicitly set to -1, while the values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is defined by the output of `func_1()` and `func_2()`.
