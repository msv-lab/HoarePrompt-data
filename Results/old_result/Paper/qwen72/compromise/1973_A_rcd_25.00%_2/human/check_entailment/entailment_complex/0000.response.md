Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each case. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Odd Sum Check**: The function checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0`. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even, as each game results in either 2 points (one win and one loss) or 2 points (a draw).

3. **Score Comparison**: The function then checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws is the sum of the other two scores, as all games could have been draws.

4. **Complex Logic for Draws**: If the above condition is not met, the function enters a more complex logic to determine the maximum number of draws. It calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and `p1` or `p2`. It then iterates from `low` to `high` and checks if `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. If the loop completes without finding a valid `cur`, it prints `p3`.

5. **Output and State**: The function correctly prints the output for each test case and ensures that the values of `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `t` remain unchanged after processing all test cases.

However, there is a potential issue in the complex logic for determining the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` and the calculation `p1 - cur + p3` might not always yield the correct maximum number of draws. Let's analyze the logic more closely:

- The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is intended to ensure that the remaining points after accounting for `cur` draws are consistent with the scores. However, this condition might not be sufficient to guarantee the maximum number of draws.
- The calculation `p1 - cur + p3` is intended to find the maximum number of draws, but it might not always be correct. For example, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 2`, the function might not correctly determine the maximum number of draws.

Given the complexity of the problem, a simpler and more reliable approach would be to use the fact that the total number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) / 2` and then determine the maximum number of draws based on the scores.

Correctness: **False**

The function's logic for determining the maximum number of draws is not robust and might not always produce the correct result. A more reliable approach is needed to ensure correctness.
