### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The function checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, and a draw contributes 1 point to each player, making the total even).
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Handling the Case Where One Player Has a Score Greater Than or Equal to the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the function prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is correct because the maximum number of draws occurs when the two players with the lowest scores have all their points from draws, and the third player has no wins or losses (since `p3` is at least the sum of the other two scores).

4. **Handling the General Case:**
   - The function calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied.
   - If such a `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no such `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

5. **Analysis of the General Case Logic:**
   - The logic in the general case is indeed flawed. The expression `p1 - cur + p3` does not correctly represent the maximum number of draws.
   - The condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is intended to ensure that the remaining points after accounting for `cur` draws can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the given scores. However, this condition and the subsequent calculation do not correctly account for the total number of games and the distribution of wins and losses.

6. **Correctness of the General Case:**
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of games played and then determine the maximum number of draws.
   - The total number of points is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - The total number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
   - The number of wins can be calculated as `(p3 - p2) + (p2 - p1)`, which simplifies to `p3 - p1`.
   - The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the number of wins.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_wins = p3 - p1
        max_draws = total_games - max_wins
        if max_draws < 0 or p3 > (p1 + p2 + max_draws):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect in the general case logic for calculating the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
