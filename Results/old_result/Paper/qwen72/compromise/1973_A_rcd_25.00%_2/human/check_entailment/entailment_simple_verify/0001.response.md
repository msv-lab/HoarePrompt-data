### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.
   - This part of the code is correct and necessary.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The function checks if the total sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes 2 points, and a draw contributes 1 point to each player, making the total even).
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Handling the Case Where One Player Has a Score Greater Than or Equal to the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the function prints `p1 + p2` as the maximum number of draws.
   - This is correct because the maximum number of draws occurs when the two players with the lowest scores have all their points from draws, and the third player has no wins or losses (since `p3` is at least the sum of the other two scores).

4. **Handling the General Case:**
   - The function calculates `low` and `high` as the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores.
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a value `cur` such that the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is satisfied.
   - If such a `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no such `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.
   - The logic in the general case is indeed flawed. The expression `p1 - cur + p3` does not necessarily represent the maximum number of draws. The correct approach should be to calculate the total number of games played and then determine the maximum number of draws based on the distribution of wins and losses.

5. **Correctness of the General Case:**
   - The general case logic is not correct. The maximum number of draws should be calculated based on the total points and the distribution of wins and losses.
   - A simpler and more correct approach would be to calculate the total number of games played and then determine the maximum number of draws.
   - The total number of points is `p1 + p2 + p3`.
   - The total number of games played is `(p1 + p2 + p3) // 2`.
   - The maximum number of wins is `p3 - p1` (since `p3` is the highest score and the difference between `p3` and `p1` represents the maximum possible wins for the highest-scoring player).
   - The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the number of wins.
   - The number of wins can be calculated as `(p3 - p2) + (p2 - p1)`, which simplifies to `p3 - p1`.

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The correct implementation should be as follows:
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for _ in range(t):
           (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
           if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
               print(-1)
               continue
           total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
           total_games = total_points // 2
           max_wins = p3 - p1
           max_draws = total_games - max_wins
           if max_draws < 0 or p3 > (p1 + p2 + max_draws):
               print(-1)
           else:
               print(max_draws)
   ```

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect in the general case logic for calculating the maximum number of draws. The logic for determining the maximum number of draws in the general case is flawed, and the correct approach should be to calculate the total number of games and then determine the maximum number of draws based on the distribution of wins and losses.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
