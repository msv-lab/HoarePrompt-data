Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The number of test cases t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
    if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
        print(-1)
        continue
    if p3 >= p1 + p2:
        print(p1 + p2)
    else:
        low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
        cur = low
        while high >= cur:
            if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                print(p1 - cur + p3)
                break
            else:
                cur += 1
        else:
            print(p3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `p_3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p_1` and `p_2` and the sum is even, `p_3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`. If `p_3` is less than the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`, the loop will have completed all iterations, and `cur` will be equal to `high + 1` if the loop did not break early. If the loop did break early, `cur` will be the value at which the condition `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)` became true. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`, `t`, and `_` will remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 1, and `_` is 1. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`. If the loop completes all iterations without breaking, `cur` is equal to `high + 1` and the output is `p3`. If the loop breaks, `cur` is the value at which the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` becomes true, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, and `_` is 2. If `p3` >= `p1` + `p2` and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `p3` < `p1` + `p2`, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is updated to `high + 1` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking. If the loop breaks, `cur` is the value at which the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` becomes true, and the output is `p1 - cur + p3`. If the loop completes all iterations, the output is `p3`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
