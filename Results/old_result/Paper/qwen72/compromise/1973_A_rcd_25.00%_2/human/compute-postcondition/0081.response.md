The value of `cur` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`, so after the increment, `cur` becomes either `low + 2` or `low + 3`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` must be at least 2, `cur` is either `low + 2` or `low + 3`.**
