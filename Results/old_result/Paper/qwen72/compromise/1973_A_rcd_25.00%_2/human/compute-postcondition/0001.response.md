The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` does not affect the loop execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `_` is the loop variable that will start from 0.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
