Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
- `t` is greater than 2 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `_` is 2 (though `_` is not used in the code snippet).
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 - cur + p3)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `low` and `high`:**
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.

2. **Determine `cur`:**
   - `cur` is either `low` or `low + 1`.

3. **Calculate `p1 - cur + p3`:**
   - We need to consider the two possible values of `cur`:
     - If `cur = low`, then the expression becomes `p1 - low + p3`.
     - If `cur = low + 1`, then the expression becomes `p1 - (low + 1) + p3`.

4. **Simplify the Expressions:**
   - If `cur = low`, then `p1 - cur + p3 = p1 - low + p3`.
   - If `cur = low + 1`, then `p1 - cur + p3 = p1 - (low + 1) + p3 = p1 - low - 1 + p3`.

### Final Output:
- The output will depend on the value of `cur`, which can be either `low` or `low + 1`.
- Therefore, the possible outputs are:
  - If `cur = low`, the output is `p1 - low + p3`.
  - If `cur = low + 1`, the output is `p1 - low - 1 + p3`.

Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, we can express the final output in terms of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

Output: **p1 - low + p3 or p1 - low - 1 + p3 (where low is the minimum of p3 - p1 and p3 - p2)**
