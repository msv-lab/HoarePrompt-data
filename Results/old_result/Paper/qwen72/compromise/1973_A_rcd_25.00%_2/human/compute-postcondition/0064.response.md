Output State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2. If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.**
