Let's analyze the initial state and the provided Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that:
   - 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30
   - The sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is even.
   - The value of `p_3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`.

2. `t` must be greater than 0.
3. `_` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(p1 + p2)
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet prints the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`.
- From the initial state, we know that `p_1` and `p_2` are integers such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= 30.
- The exact values of `p_1` and `p_2` are not provided, but we know that `p_3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`.

### Calculation:
- Since `p_3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`, and all values are integers between 0 and 30, the sum `p_1 + p_2` must be an integer that is less than or equal to 30.
- Additionally, the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is even, which implies that the sum of `p_1` and `p_2` must also be even (since `p_3` is an integer and the sum of three integers is even only if the sum of the other two is even).

### Output:
The code will print the sum of `p_1` and `p_2`, which is an even integer between 0 and 30.
Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even integer between 0 and 30)**
