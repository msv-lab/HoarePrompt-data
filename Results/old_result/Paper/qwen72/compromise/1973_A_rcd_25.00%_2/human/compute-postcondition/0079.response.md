Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(p1 - cur + p3)` statement.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that \(0 \leq p1 \leq p2 \leq p3 \leq 30\).
   - `t` is greater than 2 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet, it is mentioned).
   - `_` is 2 (though `_` is not used in the code snippet, it is mentioned).
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` must be at least 2.
   - `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.

2. **Determine `low` and `high`**:
   - Since \(p1 \leq p2 \leq p3\), `p3 - p1` will always be greater than or equal to `p3 - p2`.
   - Therefore, `low` will be `p3 - p2` and `high` will be `p3 - p1`.

3. **Determine `cur`**:
   - `cur` is either `low + 1` or `low + 2`.
   - Since `low` is `p3 - p2`, `cur` will be either \(p3 - p2 + 1\) or \(p3 - p2 + 2\).

4. **Calculate the expression `p1 - cur + p3`**:
   - `cur` can be either \(p3 - p2 + 1\) or \(p3 - p2 + 2\).
   - Let's consider both cases:
     - If `cur` is \(p3 - p2 + 1\):
       \[
       p1 - (p3 - p2 + 1) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p2 - 1 + p3 = p1 + p2 - 1
       \]
     - If `cur` is \(p3 - p2 + 2\):
       \[
       p1 - (p3 - p2 + 2) + p3 = p1 - p3 + p2 - 2 + p3 = p1 + p2 - 2
       \]

5. **Final Output**:
   - The value printed will be either \(p1 + p2 - 1\) or \(p1 + p2 - 2\), depending on the value of `cur`.

Output: **p1 + p2 - 1 or p1 + p2 - 2 (where `cur` is either `p3 - p2 + 1` or `p3 - p2 + 2`)**
