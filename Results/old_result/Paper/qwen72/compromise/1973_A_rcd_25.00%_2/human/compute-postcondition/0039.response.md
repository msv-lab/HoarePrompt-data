To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the condition `high >= cur`. The variables `high` and `cur` are the only ones that can be adjusted, as they are the ones used in the loop head.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30.
   - `t` must be greater than 1.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is equal to `low`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `high >= cur`.

3. **Analysis**:
   - `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
   - `cur` is initialized to `low`.

4. **Ensuring the Loop Executes**:
   - For the loop to execute, `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur`.
   - Since `cur` is initialized to `low`, the condition `high >= cur` will always be true because `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `low` is the minimum of the same values. Therefore, `high` is always greater than or equal to `low`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - No adjustments are needed to the variables `high` or `cur` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low`**
