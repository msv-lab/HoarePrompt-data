To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the state right before the loop.

### Loop Condition:
```
while high >= cur:
```
- The loop will execute if `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.

### State Right Before the Loop:
- `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30.
- `t` is greater than 2.
- `_` is 2.
- If the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
- `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`.
- `cur` is equal to `low`.

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `high` and `cur`.
- `cur` is set to `low`, so the condition `high >= cur` simplifies to `high >= low`.
- Since `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, it is always true that `high >= low`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop condition `high >= cur` will always be true because `high` is always greater than or equal to `low`.
- Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p1` <= `p2` <= `p3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `low` is the minimum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, `high` is the maximum of `p3 - p1` and `p3 - p2`, and `cur` is equal to `low`**.
