To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `high >= cur`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`.
- `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`.
- `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`.
- `cur` is incremented by 1.
- If `p_1 - cur <= p_2 - (p_3 - cur)`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `high >= cur` must hold.

The loop condition is `high >= cur`. For the loop to execute one more time, this condition must still be true after the previous iteration. The variables in the loop head are `high` and `cur`.

- `cur` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `cur` is `cur + 1`.
- `high` must be greater than or equal to the new value of `cur` for the loop to continue.

Thus, the condition `high >= cur + 1` must hold for the next iteration to proceed.

State: **`p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are integers provided by the user such that 0 <= `p_1` <= `p_2` <= `p_3` <= 30, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `low` is `min(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `high` is `max(p_3 - p_1, p_3 - p_2)`, `p_3` is less than `p_1 + p_2`, `cur` is incremented by 1, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `cur + 1`**.
