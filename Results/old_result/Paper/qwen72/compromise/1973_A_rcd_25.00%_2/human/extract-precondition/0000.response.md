Precondition: **The function should accept three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 as input such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, and these integers represent the scores of three players in a series of chess games. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the scores of the three players as parameters. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def max_draws(p1, p2, p3):
```

Precondition: **p1, p2, and p3 are integers such that 0 <= p1 <= p2 <= p3 <= 30, representing the scores of three players after playing a series of chess games.**
