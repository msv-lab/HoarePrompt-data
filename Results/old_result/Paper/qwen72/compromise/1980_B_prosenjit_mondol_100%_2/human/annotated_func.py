#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`. The preconditions are: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, f and k are integers such that 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, where in each iteration, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are redefined based on user input. After sorting `a` in descending order, the loop checks if the `k`-th element is greater than, less than, or equal to the `f`-th element of the original list. It prints 'NO' if the `k`-th element is greater, 'YES' if it is less, and 'MAYBE' if it is equal but not the last element or the next element is less. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are reset for each iteration, so the final state of these variables is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `f`, and `k` from user input, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks the relationship between the `f`-th element of the original list `a` and the `k`-th element of the sorted list `a` (in descending order). If the `k`-th element is greater than the `f`-th element, it prints 'NO'. If the `k`-th element is less than the `f`-th element, it prints 'YES'. If the `k`-th element is equal to the `f`-th element, it prints 'YES' if `k` is the last index or the next element in the sorted list is less than the `f`-th element; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value.
