Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`. The preconditions are: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, f and k are integers such that 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        f -= 1
        
        k -= 1
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = a[f]
        
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        if a[k] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('YES' if k == n - 1 or a[k + 1] < x else 'MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop executes for `t` iterations, where in each iteration, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are redefined based on user input. After sorting `a` in descending order, the loop checks if the `k`-th element is greater than, less than, or equal to the `f`-th element of the original list. It prints 'NO' if the `k`-th element is greater, 'YES' if it is less, and 'MAYBE' if it is equal but not the last element or the next element is less. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a` are reset for each iteration, so the final state of these variables is undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `f`, and `k` from user input, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then checks the relationship between the `f`-th element of the original list `a` and the `k`-th element of the sorted list `a` (in descending order). If the `k`-th element is greater than the `f`-th element, it prints 'NO'. If the `k`-th element is less than the `f`-th element, it prints 'YES'. If the `k`-th element is equal to the `f`-th element, it prints 'YES' if `k` is the last index or the next element in the sorted list is less than the `f`-th element; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value.
