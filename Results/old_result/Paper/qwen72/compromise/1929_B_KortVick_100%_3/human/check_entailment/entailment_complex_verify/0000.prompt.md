You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has printed either `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration based on the input provided. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. It then prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement, which is `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each test case, and `t` is decremented until it reaches 0.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
n = 3, k = 4
```

According to the problem description, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The correct answer for this test case is 2, as shown in the example provided.

However, the program's logic is as follows:
- If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
- Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \):
- \( 4n - 2 = 10 \), which is not equal to 4.
- Therefore, it prints \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).

This is correct for this specific test case, but let's consider another test case:

**Test Case:**
```
n = 3, k = 3
```

According to the problem description, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The correct answer for this test case is 2, as shown in the example provided.

However, the program's logic for this case is:
- \( 4n - 2 = 10 \), which is not equal to 3.
- Therefore, it prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).

This is correct, but let's consider a more complex test case:

**Test Case:**
```
n = 4, k = 7
```

According to the problem description, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least 7 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The correct answer for this test case is 4, as shown in the example provided.

However, the program's logic for this case is:
- \( 4n - 2 = 14 \), which is not equal to 7.
- Therefore, it prints \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \).

This is correct, but let's consider another test case:

**Test Case:**
```
n = 5, k = 10
```

According to the problem description, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least 10 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The correct answer for this test case is 5.

However, the program's logic for this case is:
- \( 4n - 2 = 18 \), which is not equal to 10.
- Therefore, it prints \( \lceil 10 / 2 \rceil = 5 \).

This is correct, but let's consider a more edge case:

**Test Case:**
```
n = 2, k = 3
```

According to the problem description, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least 3 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The correct answer for this test case is 2, as shown in the example provided.

However, the program's logic for this case is:
- \( 4n - 2 = 6 \), which is not equal to 3.
- Therefore, it prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).

This is correct, but let's consider a more complex test case:

**Test Case:**
```
n = 3, k = 9
```

According to the problem description, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least 9 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The correct answer for this test case is 5.

However, the program's logic for this case is:
- \( 4n - 2 = 10 \), which is not equal to 9.
- Therefore, it prints \( \lceil 9 / 2 \rceil = 5 \).

This is correct, but let's consider a more edge case:

**Test Case:**
```
n = 2, k = 4
```

According to the problem description, we need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least 4 diagonals have at least one colored cell. The correct answer for this test case is 3.

However, the program's logic for this case is:
- \( 4n - 2 = 6 \), which is not equal to 4.
- Therefore, it prints \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).

This is incorrect. The program should print 3, but it prints 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
