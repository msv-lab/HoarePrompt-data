Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2, which does not account for the overlap in visibility times correctly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6 7 4
```
The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output:
```
2 // 6 + 2 // 7 + 2 = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2
```
This happens to be correct for this specific input, but it does not handle other cases correctly.

Consider another input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
The correct output should be 7, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output:
```
10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7
```
Again, this happens to be correct for this specific input, but the logic is flawed.

A more critical case is:
```
1
1 1 1
```
The correct output should be 4, but the program will output:
```
1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```
This is correct, but the program does not handle the general case correctly. For example, if the input is:
```
1
1 1 10
```
The correct output should be 22, but the program will output:
```
10 // 1 + 10 // 1 + 2 = 10 + 10 + 2 = 22
```
However, the logic in the program does not account for the fact that the visibility period of each firework is \(m + 1\) minutes, and it does not correctly handle the overlap of visibility times. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
