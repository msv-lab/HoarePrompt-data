Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the original rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and then rearranging them. The logic of the program is based on the fact that for Bob to be able to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions of the original rectangle must be even. This is because cutting an even dimension in half will result in two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions (considering the 90-degree rotation equivalence).

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Check**: For each test case, it checks if either `a` or `b` is even (`a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`).
3. **Output**: If either dimension is even, it prints "Yes" (indicating that Bob can form another rectangle). Otherwise, it prints "No".

This logic aligns with the problem description and correctly handles the constraints and examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
