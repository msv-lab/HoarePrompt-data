You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0), int(x ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
            if x % i == 0:
                l = [ans]
                if i <= k:
                    l.append(i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    l.append(x // i)
                ans = max(l)
        print(ans)

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the last integer input from the test cases, `n` is the last integer input from the test cases, `k` is the integer division of the last `x` by the last `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), and `i` is the last value of the loop variable `i` that was used in the inner loop, which is an odd integer between 1 and the square root of the last `x` (inclusive), incremented by 2 each step. The variable `ans` holds the maximum value found in the inner loop for the last test case, which is either 1, `i`, or `x // i` if they are less than or equal to `k`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum balance is the largest integer `d` such that `d` divides `x` and `x // d` is at least `n`.
   - This is because if `d` divides `x`, then each sub-problem can have a difficulty of `d` and there will be `x // d` sub-problems. For the balance to be `d`, `x // d` must be at least `n`.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - For each test case, we need to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x // d >= n`.
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It calculates `k = x // n`, which is the minimum difficulty each sub-problem can have if the balance is to be maximized.
   - If `k == 1`, the maximum balance is 1 because the only way to split `x` into `n` parts is to have each part be 1.
   - Otherwise, it iterates over possible divisors of `x` starting from 2 (if `x` is even) or 3 (if `x` is odd) up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` divides `x` and if `i` or `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. It updates the maximum balance `ans` accordingly.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k == 1` by printing 1.
   - The loop to find the divisors is efficient by only checking up to the square root of `x`.
   - The program correctly updates the maximum balance by considering both `i` and `x // i` as potential divisors.
   - However, there is a potential issue in the loop initialization. The loop starts from `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0)`, which means it starts from 2 if `x` is even and 3 if `x` is odd. This skips the divisor 1, which is always a valid divisor and should be considered.

5. **Fixing the Issue:**
   - To ensure the divisor 1 is considered, the loop should start from 1 and not skip it.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        k = x // n
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if i <= k:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x // i <= k:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)
```

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it skips the divisor 1, which is always a valid divisor and should be considered.
- The corrected program is **correct**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
