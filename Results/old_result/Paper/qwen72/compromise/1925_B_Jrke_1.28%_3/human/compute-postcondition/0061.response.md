Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, `i` is `i + 2`, `ans` remains unchanged if `x % i != 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which is either `[ans]`, `[ans, i]`, `[ans, x // i]`, or `[ans, i, x // i]` depending on the conditions `x // i` <= `k` and `i` <= `k`.**
