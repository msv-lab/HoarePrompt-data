The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range` function. The `range` function depends on the input value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the input value must be greater than 0. The variables `t`, `x`, and `n` are not directly part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to affect the loop's execution directly.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x
- Each test case is represented by a pair of integers (x, n)

To ensure the loop executes, the input to the `range` function must be at least 1. Therefore, the input value must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, and the input value is greater than 0**
