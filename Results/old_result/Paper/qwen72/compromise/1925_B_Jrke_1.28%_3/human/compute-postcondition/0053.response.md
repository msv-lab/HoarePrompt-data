Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)` and `x % i == 0`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the value of `x // i` and, if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the value of `i`. `ans` is the maximum value in `l`.**
