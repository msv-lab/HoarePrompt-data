Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the last integer input from the test cases, `n` is the last integer input from the test cases, `k` is the integer division of the last `x` by the last `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), and `i` is the last value of the loop variable `i` that was used in the inner loop, which is an odd integer between 1 and the square root of the last `x` (inclusive), incremented by 2 each step. The variable `ans` holds the maximum value found in the inner loop for the last test case, which is either 1, `i`, or `x // i` if they are less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` still represents the number of test cases, which is within the range 1 to 10^3. The variables `x` and `n` hold the values from the last test case input, and `k` is the result of the integer division of `x` by `n`. The variable `i` is the last value used in the inner loop, which iterates through odd numbers starting from 1 (or 2 if `x` is even) up to the square root of `x`, incremented by 2 each step. The variable `ans` holds the maximum value found during the inner loop for the last test case, which is either 1, the current value of `i`, or `x // i` if they are less than or equal to `k`.
