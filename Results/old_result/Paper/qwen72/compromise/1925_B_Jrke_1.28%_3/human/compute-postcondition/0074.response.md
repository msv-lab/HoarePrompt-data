Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x)`, `x` and `n` are updated to the new integer inputs.**

Explanation: The values of `x` and `n` are updated to the new integer inputs provided by `input().split()`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged, but their values are now based on the new values of `x` and `n`.
