The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop is controlled by the value returned by `int(input())`, which is not a state from the previous iteration but a new input for each loop. Therefore, the state of `_` is incremented by 1 for each iteration, but since it is not explicitly tracked, we do not need to adjust it. The loop will execute a fixed number of times determined by the input.

Given that the loop does not modify the loop head variables directly and the loop counter `_` is not part of the state provided, the state remains the same for the next iteration in terms of the variables provided. However, the loop will proceed to the next iteration if the input allows for it.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is the value of `int(x`**

Note: The state of `i` seems to be cut off in the provided state, and it's unclear what the full state of `i` should be. If `i` is meant to be the loop counter, it would be incremented, but since it's not part of the loop head in the given code, it remains unchanged. If `i` is meant to be something else, please provide the full state of `i` for a more accurate adjustment.
