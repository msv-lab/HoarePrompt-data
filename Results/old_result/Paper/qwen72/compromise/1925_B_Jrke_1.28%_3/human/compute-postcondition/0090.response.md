Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the new first integer input and must be greater than 1 if even, `n` is the new second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is `int(x)` (where `x` is the new first integer input), `ans` is 1. If `x % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x // i <= k`, the list `l` contains the values 1, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains only the values 1 and `i`. If `x % i != 0`, the list `l` remains unchanged and `ans` is still 1.***
