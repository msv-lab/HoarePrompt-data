Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `ans` is 1, `i` is 3 if `x % 2 != 0` or 4 if `x % 2 == 0`, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and `i`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`.
- `i` is 3 if `x` is odd, or 4 if `x` is even.
- The list `l` initially contains the value 1, and after the code is executed, it contains the values 1 and `i`.
- All other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
