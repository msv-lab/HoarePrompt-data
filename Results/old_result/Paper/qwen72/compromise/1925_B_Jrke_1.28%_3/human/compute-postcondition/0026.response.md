Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is between 1 and the new value of `x`, `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is 3 if `x % 2 != 0` or 4 if `x % 2 == 0`, and `l` is a list containing the value 1 and possibly `x // i` if `i` <= `k`. If `x % i == 0`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 1.***
