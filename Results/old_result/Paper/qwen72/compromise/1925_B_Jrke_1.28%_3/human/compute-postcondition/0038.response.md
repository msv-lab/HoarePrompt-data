Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input, `n` is the second integer input, `k` is the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n` (i.e., `k = x // n`), `i` is the value of the new `x`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `t` and `k` remain the same as in the initial state, but `x` and `n` are updated based on the input.
- `x` and `n` are now assigned the values from the input, where `x` is the first integer and `n` is the second integer.
- `k` is recalculated as the integer division of the new `x` by the new `n`.
- `i` is assigned the value of the new `x`.
