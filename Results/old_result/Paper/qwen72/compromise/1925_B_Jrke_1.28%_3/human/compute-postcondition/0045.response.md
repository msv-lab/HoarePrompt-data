Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is the first integer input such that `1 + (1 if x % 2 == 0 else 0) < int(x)`, and `x % i == 0`.** 

This means that `t` remains within the specified range, `x` satisfies the given condition, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i` equals 0).
