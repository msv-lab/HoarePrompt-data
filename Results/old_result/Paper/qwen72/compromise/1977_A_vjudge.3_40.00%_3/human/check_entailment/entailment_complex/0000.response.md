### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Loop**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t` from the user.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `t` times, each time reading two integers `n` and `m` from the user.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **`if n == m:`**: If the number of moves `n` is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes `m`, then it is possible to build the tower by simply adding `m` cubes in `m` moves. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif m > n:`**: If the desired number of cubes `m` is greater than the number of moves `n`, it is impossible to build a tower with `m` cubes because you can only perform `n` moves. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif m == n - 1:`**: If `m` is exactly one less than `n`, it is possible to build the tower by adding `m` cubes and then removing one cube, or by removing one cube and then adding `m` cubes. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:`**: If both `m` and `n` are even, it is possible to build the tower. This is because you can always add or remove cubes in pairs to achieve the desired even number of cubes. This condition is correct.
   - **`elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:`**: If both `m` and `n` are odd, it is possible to build the tower. This is because you can always add or remove cubes in pairs, and the last move can be used to adjust the parity to match the desired odd number of cubes. This condition is correct.
   - **`else:`**: If none of the above conditions are met, it is impossible to build the tower. This condition is correct because it covers all remaining cases where the parity of `m` and `n` do not match, making it impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions for each test case, which matches the problem description.

4. **Final State**:
   - The final state of the program is as described in the comments: the values of `n` and `m` will be the last pair of integers input by the user during the final iteration of the loop, and the value of `t` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves based on the given conditions. The conditions cover all possible scenarios, and the output matches the problem description.

**Correctness: **True****
