### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can perform two types of moves: adding 1 cube or removing 1 cube.
   - After `n` moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly `m` cubes.
   - The key insight is that the number of cubes `m` must be within the range of possible outcomes after `n` moves. Since each move can either add or remove a cube, the number of cubes `m` must be such that `0 <= m <= n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It then checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

3. **Conditions in the Program:**
   - `if n == m: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if `n` equals `m`, Nikita can simply add `m` cubes in `n` moves.
   - `elif m > n: print('No')`
     - This is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.
   - `elif m == n - 1: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if `m` is `n - 1`, Nikita can add `m` cubes and then remove one cube in the last move.
   - `elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if both `m` and `n` are even, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs.
   - `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0: print('Yes')`
     - This is correct because if both `m` and `n` are odd, Nikita can achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in pairs, and then making one additional move to adjust the parity.
   - `else: print('No')`
     - This is correct because if none of the above conditions are met, it's impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `m` is 0 or `n` is 0 correctly.
   - The conditions cover all possible parities of `m` and `n`.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state and behavior of the program.
- The conditions in the program are well-annotated and align with the problem's requirements.
- The loop correctly processes each test case and prints the appropriate result based on the conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles all the cases and conditions described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
