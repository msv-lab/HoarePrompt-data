Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input and parses it into a list of test cases, each containing a pair of integers (n, k). This is done using `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input into a list of strings, then converting the relevant parts to integers and storing them in a list of tuples. This part of the program is accurate and meets the problem's input requirements.

2. **Sequence Generation**: The program generates a sequence of 25 elements, where each element is a power of 2 (i.e., `2 ** i` for `i` in the range 0 to 24). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`.

3. **Sequence Properties**:
   - **No Subsequence with Sum k**: The sequence generated is a set of distinct powers of 2. The sum of any subsequence of distinct powers of 2 is unique and can be represented as a binary number. Therefore, it is impossible to form a subsequence that sums to any specific value `k` unless `k` is one of the sums of the subsequences of the sequence. However, the sequence generated is always the same for all test cases, and it is not tailored to avoid the specific value `k` for each test case. For example, if `k` is 1, the sequence will always include 1, making it possible to form a subsequence that sums to 1. This violates the condition that no subsequence should sum to `k`.

   - **All Other Sums**: The sequence can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{25} - 1\) (which is 33,554,431) by selecting appropriate elements. Since \(n \le 10^6\), the sequence can certainly form any sum from 1 to \(n\) except for `k`. However, the issue is that the sequence is not modified to ensure that `k` is not one of the possible sums. For example, if `k` is 1, the sequence will always include 1, which means a subsequence can sum to 1, violating the condition.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the size of the sequence (25) and the sequence itself for each test case. While the output format is correct, the sequence does not meet the problem's requirements for all test cases because it does not ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]` will have a subsequence that sums to 2, which is not allowed.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence will have a subsequence that sums to 1, which is not allowed.
   - For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence will have a subsequence that sums to 8, which is not allowed.
   - For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the sequence will have a subsequence that sums to 3, which is not allowed.
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence will have a subsequence that sums to 7, which is not allowed.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` for each test case. The sequence is always the same and does not adapt to the specific values of `n` and `k`.

Final: **False**
