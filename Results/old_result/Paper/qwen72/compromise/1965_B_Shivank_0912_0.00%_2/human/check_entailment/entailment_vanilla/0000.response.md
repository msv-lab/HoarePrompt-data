Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input and parses it into a list of test cases, each containing a pair of integers (n, k). This is done using `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input into a list of strings, then converting the relevant parts to integers and storing them in a list of tuples.

2. **Sequence Generation**: The program generates a sequence of 25 elements, where each element is a power of 2 (i.e., `2 ** i` for `i` in the range 0 to 24). This sequence is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`.

3. **Sequence Properties**:
   - **No Subsequence with Sum k**: The sequence generated is a set of distinct powers of 2. The sum of any subsequence of distinct powers of 2 is unique and can be represented as a binary number. Therefore, it is impossible to form a subsequence that sums to any specific value `k` unless `k` is one of the sums of the subsequences of the sequence.
   - **All Other Sums**: The sequence can form any sum from 1 to \(2^{25} - 1\) (which is 33,554,431) by selecting appropriate elements. Since \(n \le 10^6\), the sequence can certainly form any sum from 1 to \(n\) except for `k`.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the size of the sequence (25) and the sequence itself for each test case. This is consistent with the problem requirements, as the sequence meets the conditions for all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the sequence `[1, 2, 4, 8, ...]` will not have a subsequence that sums to 2, but it will have a subsequence that sums to 1.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 1`, the sequence will not have a subsequence that sums to 1, but it will have subsequences that sum to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
   - For `n = 8` and `k = 8`, the sequence will not have a subsequence that sums to 8, but it will have subsequences that sum to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
   - For `n = 9` and `k = 3`, the sequence will not have a subsequence that sums to 3, but it will have subsequences that sum to 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 7`, the sequence will not have a subsequence that sums to 7, but it will have subsequences that sum to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in generating a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
