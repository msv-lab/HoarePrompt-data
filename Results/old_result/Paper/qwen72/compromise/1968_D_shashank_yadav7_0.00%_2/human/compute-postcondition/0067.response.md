The code snippet `b = p[b] - 1` affects the variable `b` by assigning it the value of `p[b] - 1`. The initial state does not provide specific values for `p` or `b`, so we can only describe the change in `b` based on the operation performed. The values of `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, and the condition that `k` is -1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement still holds.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
