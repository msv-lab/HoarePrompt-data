Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
