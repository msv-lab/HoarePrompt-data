Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n`, `b` is an input integer minus 1, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the value at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the value at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is the value of `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the value of `a[s] * k`, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the condition `bm > sm` is true. If `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` is false. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is -1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b] + a[b]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is -3, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp) + max(bm, a[b] * -3 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp) + max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + 3 * a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + 2 * a[b]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
