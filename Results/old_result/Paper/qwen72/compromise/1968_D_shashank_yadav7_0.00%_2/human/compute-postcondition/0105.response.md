Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `bm` is the cumulative sum of `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` for each iteration, `sm` is the cumulative sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` for each iteration, `sp` is the initial `sp` plus `a[s]` added `n - 1` times, `bp` is the initial `bp` plus `a[b]` added `n - 1` times. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `p = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores them in a list `p`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `p` is now a list of integers, reflecting the input provided.
