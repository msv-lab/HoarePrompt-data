Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated by adding the result of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` to its current value.
- Since `k` is -2, `a[s] * k` becomes `a[s] * -2`.
- Therefore, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sp`, and `bp` remain unchanged or are updated as previously described.
