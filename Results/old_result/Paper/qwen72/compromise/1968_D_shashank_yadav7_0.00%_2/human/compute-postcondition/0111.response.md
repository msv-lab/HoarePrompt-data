Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `b` is `b - 1`, `s` is `s - 1`, `bm` is now `a[b] * k`, `sm` is the cumulative sum of `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` for each iteration, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is now `a[b]`, `bm` is greater than `sm` if `a[b] * k` was greater than `sm` before, otherwise `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`, `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.**
