Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is updated to `p[b] - 1`, `s` is updated to `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + 2 * a[b]`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. If `k` was 0, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 2.
- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `k` is still decreased by 1.
- `b` is still updated to `p[b] - 1`.
- `s` is still updated to `p[s] - 1`.
- `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]` because the code snippet `sp += a[s]` adds `a[s]` to the existing value of `sp`, which was already `sp + a[s]`.
- `bp` is still updated to `bp + 2 * a[b]`.
- `bm` is still updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)`. If `k` was 0, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp)`.
- `sm` is still updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`.
- We still break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
