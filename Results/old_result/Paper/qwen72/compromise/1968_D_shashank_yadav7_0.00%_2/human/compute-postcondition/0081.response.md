Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is -2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to `bm + max(bm, a[p[b] - 1] * -1 + bp)`, `sm` is updated to `max(sm, a[p[s] - 1] * -1 + sp) + max(sm, a[s] * -2 + sp)`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sp` is updated by adding `a[s]` to its current value, which was already `sp + a[s]` from the initial state.
- Therefore, `sp` is now `sp + a[s] + a[s]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, and `bp`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
