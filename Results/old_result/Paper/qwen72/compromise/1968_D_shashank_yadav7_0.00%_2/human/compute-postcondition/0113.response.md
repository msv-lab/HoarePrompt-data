The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state of `i` is `n`, but for the loop to start, `i` must be 0.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
