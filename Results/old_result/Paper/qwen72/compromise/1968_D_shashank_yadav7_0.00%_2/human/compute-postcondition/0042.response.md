Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer minus `n`, `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times), `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1] - 1]` (where the `p` is applied `n` times), `p` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over `n` iterations, `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over `n` iterations, `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over `n` iterations.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains the same as the input integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`i`**: After the loop, `i` is `n - 1` because the loop runs `n` times, and `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- **`n`**: Remains the same as the input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`k`**: Decreases by `n` because `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- **`b`**: After `n` iterations, `b` is the result of applying the transformation `p[b] - 1` `n` times. This means `b` is updated to the value at the index `p[b] - 1`, then to the value at the index `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, and so on, for `n` iterations.
- **`s`**: Similarly, `s` is the result of applying the transformation `p[s] - 1` `n` times.
- **`p`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`sp`**: After `n` iterations, `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `s` in the list `a` over the `n` iterations. Each iteration, `sp` is updated by adding the value at the current index `s` in `a`.
- **`bp`**: Similarly, `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `b` in the list `a` over the `n` iterations.
- **`bm`**: After `n` iterations, `bm` is the sum of the values of `a[b] * (k - 1) + max(a[b] * (k - 1), a[b] * k + bp)` over the `n` iterations. Each iteration, `bm` is updated by adding the maximum of `a[b] * (k - 1)` and `a[b] * k + bp`.
- **`sm`**: Similarly, `sm` is the sum of the values of `a[s] * (k - 1) + max(a[s] * (k - 1), a[s] * k + sp)` over the `n` iterations.

If `k` becomes 0 at any point during the loop, the loop will break, and the final values of `bm` and `sm` will be affected by the last iteration where `k` was non-zero.
