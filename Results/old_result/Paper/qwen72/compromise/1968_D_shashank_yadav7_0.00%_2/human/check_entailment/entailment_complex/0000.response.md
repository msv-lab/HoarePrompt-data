Reasoning:

The function `func` is intended to simulate the "Permutation game" as described. However, there are a few issues in the implementation that affect its correctness:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `bm` and `sm`**:
   - The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` within the loop is incorrect. The line `bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)` is not consistent with the game rules. According to the rules, the score should increase by `a_x` where `x` is the current position, and then the player can either stay or move to `p_x`. The current implementation seems to be trying to calculate a maximum possible score, but it does not follow the game's rules correctly.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates `n` times, which is not necessary. The game lasts for `k` turns, so the loop should iterate `k` times, not `n` times. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when `k` is much smaller than `n`.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The initial score for Bodya and Sasha should be `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively, which is correctly done. However, the subsequent score updates should only add `a[p[b] - 1]` and `a[p[s] - 1]` to their current scores, not use the `max` function as currently implemented.

4. **Breaking the Loop**:
   - The loop breaks when `k` reaches 0, which is correct. However, the loop should iterate exactly `k` times, and the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the incorrect logic inside the loop.

5. **Permutation Handling**:
   - The permutation `p` is 1-indexed, so the correct way to access the next position is `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is correctly done in the loop.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
