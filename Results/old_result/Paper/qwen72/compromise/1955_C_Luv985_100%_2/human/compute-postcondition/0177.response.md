Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `k` is a positive integer and has been decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` where `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is 1 or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n-1]` is `a[n-1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 1 + 1 = 2.
- If `a[l]` was 0, then `l` was set to 1 and `ans` was set to 1. Now, `ans` is incremented by 1, so `ans` is 2 and `l` remains 1.
- If `a[l]` was not 0, then `l` remains 0 and `ans` was initially 0, so after incrementing, `ans` is 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `a`, `T`, `r`, `mi`, `a[0]`, `a[n-1]`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
