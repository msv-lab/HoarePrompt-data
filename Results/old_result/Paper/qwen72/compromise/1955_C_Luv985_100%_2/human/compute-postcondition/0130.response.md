Postcondition: ***`t` is `k % 2`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and has been decreased by 1, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. `l` must be less than `r`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3.***
