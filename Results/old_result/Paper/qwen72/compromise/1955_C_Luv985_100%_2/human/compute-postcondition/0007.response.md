Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of strings representing the input values, `T` is a non-zero integer and is now `T - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `a = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. The previous state of `a` as a list of integers is no longer valid, and `a` now holds a list of strings. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `T` remain unchanged, with `T` still being a non-zero integer and now equal to `T - 1`.
