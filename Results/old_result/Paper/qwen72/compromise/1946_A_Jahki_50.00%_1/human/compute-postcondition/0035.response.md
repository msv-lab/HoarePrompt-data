Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer and is less than or equal to 10000, `case` is an input string, `op` is the number of times the loop has executed, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` before the loop started, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` and is greater than `median`.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`.
- Each iteration increments the value at the median index (`ma`) in the sorted list `b` by 1, and the operation counter `op` is incremented by 1.
- After each increment, the list `b` is sorted again to ensure the order is maintained.
- The loop will stop when `new_median` becomes greater than `median`.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `new_median` will be greater than `median`, and `op` will reflect the total number of times the loop has executed.
