The variables in the loop head are `new_median` and `median`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the comparison between `new_median` and `median`. If `new_median` is less than or equal to `median`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `new_median` is the same as `median`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `new_median` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `median`. However, since `new_median` is already equal to `median`, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is an input string, `op` is 1, `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even or `num2 // 2` if `num2` is odd, `median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b`, `new_median` is the element at index `ma` in the list `b` (which is the same as `median`)**
