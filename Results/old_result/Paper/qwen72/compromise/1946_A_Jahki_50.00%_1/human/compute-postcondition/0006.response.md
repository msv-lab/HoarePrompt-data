The given Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement:

```python
print(1)
```

This statement prints the integer `1`.

The initial state provides various details about other variables and objects (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`), but none of these variables or objects are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the literal value `1` that is being printed.

Output: **1**
