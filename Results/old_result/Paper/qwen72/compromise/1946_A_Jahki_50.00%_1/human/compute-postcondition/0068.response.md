Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from `case`, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is the number of iterations it took for `new_median` to become greater than `median`, `b` is a sorted list of integers from `a`, `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2) - 1` if `num2` is even, otherwise `ma` is set to `int(num2 / 2)`, `median` is the value of `b[ma]` before any iterations, `new_median` is `median + op`, `b[ma]` is now `median + op`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `op` will be the total number of iterations the loop executed until `new_median` became greater than `median`.
- The list `b` remains sorted, and the element at index `ma` (which is the median position) will be incremented by the number of iterations (`op`).
- The variable `new_median` will be equal to the original `median` plus the number of iterations (`op`).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `num`, `i`, `num2`, `case`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
