Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers extracted from the string `case` where each element is a digit string converted to an integer, the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `num` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num2` is an input integer, `case` is the new input string, `op` is 0, `b` is a sorted version of the list `a`.**
