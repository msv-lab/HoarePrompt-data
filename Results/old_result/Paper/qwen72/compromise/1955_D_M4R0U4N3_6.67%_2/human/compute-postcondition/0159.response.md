Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` must be greater than 0, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input minus `a[1]`, `done` is a set containing the integers `a[0]` and `a[1]`, `extra` is a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` is not in `todo`, otherwise `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input, and `j` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `done.add(a[j])` adds the element `a[1]` to the set `done`.
- Initially, `done` was a set containing `a[0]` if `a[j]` (which is `a[1]`) was in `todo`, otherwise `done` was an empty set.
- After adding `a[1]` to `done`, the set `done` now contains both `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
- The other variables (`a`, `r`, `m`, `n`, `old`, `todo`, `extra`, `ans`, `k`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
