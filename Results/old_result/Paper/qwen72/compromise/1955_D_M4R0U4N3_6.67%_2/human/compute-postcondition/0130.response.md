Output State: **`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[r - m]`, `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, then `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `old` is updated to `a[r - m]`.
- The values of `r`, `m`, and `n` remain the same.
- The conditions for `n` being greater than `m + 2` and the states of `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remain unchanged.
- The logic for updating `extra`, `done`, and `todo` based on the presence of `a[1]` and `a[r]` remains the same.
- The condition for updating `ans` based on the length of `done` remains the same.
