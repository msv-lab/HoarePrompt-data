Output State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, `a`, `extra`, `done`, `todo`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**

The value of `old` is now `a[1]` because `r` is `m + 1`, and `r - m` equals 1. The other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
