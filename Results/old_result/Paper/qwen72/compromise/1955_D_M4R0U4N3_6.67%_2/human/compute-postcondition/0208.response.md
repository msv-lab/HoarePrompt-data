Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `m + 2`, `m` is less than `n`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is now `a[r - m]`, `extra` is a set containing the integers from `a[0]` to `a[m-1]` that were not in `todo` minus `old`, plus the integer `a[r]` if `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `todo` no longer includes `a[r]`, `done` includes `a[r]`, and if `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1.** 

The code `todo.remove(a[r])` removes the integer at index `r` from the `todo` list. `a[r]` is now included in the `done` list. The `extra` set is updated to reflect the removal of `old` and the addition of `a[r]` if `a[r]` was not in `todo`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is incremented by 1. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
