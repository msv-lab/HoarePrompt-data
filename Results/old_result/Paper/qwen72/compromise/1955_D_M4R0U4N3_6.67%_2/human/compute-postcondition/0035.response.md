Postcondition: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m`, and `old` is `a[0]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` has been removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` but is in `done`, `old` has been removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `a[r]` is in `todo`.**
