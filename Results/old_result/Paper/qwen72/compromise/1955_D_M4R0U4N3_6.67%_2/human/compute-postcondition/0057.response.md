The only objects in the loop head are variables `r`, `m`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `r`, `m`, and `n`. If `r` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 1`, and `n` is greater than `m + 1`.

At the start of the next iteration, `r` is incremented by 1, so `r` becomes `m + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `r` must still be less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`.

State: **`m` is less than `n`, `r` is `m + 2`, `n` must be greater than `m + 2`, `old` is `a[1]`, and `a` and `ans` remain unchanged. If `len(done) >= k`, `ans` is increased by 1. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `old`, and `done`, `todo` remain unchanged. If `old` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. Otherwise, `done` and `todo` remain unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `todo` no longer contains `a[m + 1]` and `done` now contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`.**
