Output State: **`a` is a list of integers from the input, `r` is `n`, `m` is `m`, `n` is the first integer input, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `todo` is a set containing the integers from the new input, `done` is an empty set, `extra` is an empty set, `ans` is the total number of times the length of `done` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `k` is the third integer input.**

The code initializes `extra` as an empty set, which overrides its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
