Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is `n`, `m` is `m`, `old` is `a[n - m - 1]`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `todo` contains a set of integers read from the new input, with all elements `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `m-1`) removed if they were in `todo`. `done` is a set containing the integers `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `m-1`) that were in `todo`. `extra` contains the integers `a[j]` (for `j` from 0 to `m-1`) that were not in `todo`. `ans` is 1 if the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is 0. `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input, and `j` is `m-1`.
Code of the loop:
for r in range(m, n):
    old = a[r - m]
    if old in extra:
        extra.remove(old)
    elif old in done:
        done.remove(old)
        todo.add(old)
    if a[r] in todo:
        todo.remove(a[r])
        done.add(a[r])
    else:
        extra.add(a[r])
    if len(done) >= k:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`r` is `m`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m`. If `old` is in `extra`, `old` is removed from `extra`. If `old` is not in `extra` and `old` is in `done`, `old` is removed from `done` and added to `todo`. Otherwise, the state of `done` and `todo` remains unchanged. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `a[r]` is added to `extra`. If the length of `done` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`r` is `m + 1`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, `n` must be greater than `m + 1`, `old` is `a[1]`, and the state of `done`, `todo`, and `extra` remains unchanged. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, then `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, then `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is `ans + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`r` is `m + 2`, `m` is `m`, `n` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than `m + 2`. `old` is `a[r - m]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and added to `done`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[r - m]`. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is not in `todo`, `extra` now contains `a[r]`. If `old` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[r - m]`. If `a[1]` is in `extra`, `extra` no longer contains `a[1]`. If `a[1]` is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `a[1]` and `todo` now contains `a[1]`. If `a[r]` is in `todo`, `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]`. Otherwise, `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`. If `len(done) >= k`, then `ans` is incremented by 1. If `old` is not in `extra` and is in `done`, `done` no longer contains `old`, `todo` now contains `old` and `a[1]` (if `a[1]` was in `done`), `extra` no longer contains `a[1]` (if `a[1]` was in `extra`), `a[r]` is removed from `todo` and `done` contains `a[r]` (if `a[r]` was in `todo`), otherwise `extra` now contains `a[m + 1]`, and `ans` is incremented by 1 if `len(done) >= k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
