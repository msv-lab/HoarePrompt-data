Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 2. If the second element of `a` is in `todo`, `todo` is updated to remove the second element of `a`, `done` is a set containing the second and third elements of `a`, and `extra` is a set containing the first element of `a` if the first element of `a` was not in `todo`. If the second element of `a` is not in `todo`, `extra` is a set containing the second element of `a` and possibly the first element of `a` if it was not in `todo`, `todo` is updated to remove the second element of `a` if it was in `todo`, and `done` is a set containing the second element of `a` if it was in `todo`, and possibly the first element of `a` if it was in `todo`.**
