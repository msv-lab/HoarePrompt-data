If `lex` is 25, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 78.**
