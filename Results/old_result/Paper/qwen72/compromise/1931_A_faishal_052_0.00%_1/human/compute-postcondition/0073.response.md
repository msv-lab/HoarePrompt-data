Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `arr` contains the elements 26 and 26, and `lex` is reduced by 26.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append(26)` adds the element 26 to the list `arr`.
- Initially, `arr` contains either 1, 26, or 26 and 26 based on the value of `lex`.
- After appending 26, `arr` will contain 26 and 26 if `lex` was initially greater than or equal to 52.
- The value of `lex` is reduced by 26 if it was initially greater than or equal to 52.
- The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
