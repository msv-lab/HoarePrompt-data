Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1]` and `lex` is an input integer minus 1, with the current value of `lex` being less than or equal to 25. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` is a list containing `[26]`, and `lex` is updated to the input integer minus 26, with the current value of `lex` being greater than or equal to 26. If `lex` is between 0 and 26 (exclusive), `lex` remains an input integer within this range.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `arr` contains `[1, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 2. If `lex` is 25, `arr` contains `[26, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 27. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` contains `[1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 27. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains `[26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 52.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to 23, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 3. If `lex` is 24, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 27. If `lex` is greater than 24 and less than or equal to 50, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 27. If `lex` is 51, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 1]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 52. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 75, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 28. If `lex` is 76, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than 76 and less than or equal to 101, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 102, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 78.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
