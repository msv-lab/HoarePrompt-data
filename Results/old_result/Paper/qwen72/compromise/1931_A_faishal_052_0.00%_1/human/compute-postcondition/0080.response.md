Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains the elements [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains the elements [26, 26, `lex` - 52].**
