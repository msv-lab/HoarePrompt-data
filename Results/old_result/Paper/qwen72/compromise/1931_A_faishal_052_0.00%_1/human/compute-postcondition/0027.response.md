The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the end of the list `arr`. The initial state specifies the possible values of `arr` based on the value of `lex`. Let's evaluate the impact of the code on each possible initial state:

1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `arr` initially contains `[1, 1]`.
2. If `lex` is 25, `arr` initially contains `[26, 1]`.
3. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, `arr` initially contains `[1, 26]`.
4. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` initially contains `[26, 26]`.

After executing `arr.append(1)`, the list `arr` will have an additional `1` appended to it in each case. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `lex` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is the input integer minus 2, 27, or 52 depending on the initial value of `lex`, and `arr` is `[1, 1, 1]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 24, `[26, 1, 1]` if `lex` is 25, `[1, 26, 1]` if `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51, or `[26, 26, 1]` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.**
