The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `2`, so we can only adjust those. The loop `for j in range(2):` will execute 2 times regardless of the state of `cases`, `i`, `arr`, or `lex` because `range(2)` will always produce the sequence `[0, 1]`.

However, to ensure that the loop can start and execute, the variable `j` should be initialized to 0 before the loop begins, as this is the starting value of the range.

Since the loop will execute 2 times by default, no other adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute. However, for clarity, we can state that `j` is 0 and the loop will execute 2 times.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer, `j` is 0**
