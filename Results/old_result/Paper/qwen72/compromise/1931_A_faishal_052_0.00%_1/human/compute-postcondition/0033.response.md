Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `arr` is a list. If `lex` is less than or equal to -2, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 28. If `lex` is 25, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than 25 and less than or equal to 27, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 78. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than or equal to 24, `arr` contains `[1, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 28. If `lex` is 76, `arr` contains `[26, 1, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than 76 and less than or equal to 101, `arr` contains `[1, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 53. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 102, `arr` contains `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is the input integer minus 78.***
