The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `2`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 1, and it must still be less than `2`.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list, `k` is 2, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 25, `arr` contains the element 1 and `lex` is reduced by 1. If `lex` is between 26 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` remains unchanged. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` contains the element 26 and `lex` is reduced by 26.**
