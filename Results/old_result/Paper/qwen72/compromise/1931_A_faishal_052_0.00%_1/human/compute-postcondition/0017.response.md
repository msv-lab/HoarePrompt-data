The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range limit, which is 2. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than 2. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 1. The range limit remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `arr` is a list containing `[1]` if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or `[26]` if `lex` is greater than or equal to 26, and `lex` is the input integer minus 1 if `lex` is less than or equal to 25, or minus 26 if `lex` is greater than or equal to 26.**
