The `arr.sort()` function sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `lex`:

- If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`].
- If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, `arr` is [26, 1, `lex`].
- If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is [26, 26, `lex - 27`].

Let's consider each case:

1. **If `lex` is less than or equal to 26:**
   - `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`].
   - After sorting, `arr` will be [1, 1, `lex`].

2. **If `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52:**
   - `arr` is [26, 1, `lex`].
   - After sorting, `arr` will be [1, 26, `lex`].

3. **If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52:**
   - `arr` is [26, 26, `lex - 27`].
   - After sorting, `arr` will be [26, 26, `lex - 27`].

The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is [1, 1, `lex`] if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, [1, 26, `lex`] if `lex` is greater than 26 and less than 52, or [26, 26, `lex - 27`] if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52.**
