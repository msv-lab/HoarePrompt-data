The only objects in the loop head are the variable `k` and the range object `range(3)`. The loop will execute 3 times regardless of the values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, or `lex`, because the range is fixed and will always produce the sequence `[0, 1, 2]`.

However, since the task is to adjust the state for the loop to execute, and the loop will execute as long as the range is defined, we need to ensure that `k` is set to a value that allows the loop to start, which is `0`.

State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 0, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` <= 26, `arr` contains [1, 1, `lex` - 2]. If `lex` is between 27 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]. If `lex` >= 52, `arr` contains [26, 26, `lex` - 52]**
