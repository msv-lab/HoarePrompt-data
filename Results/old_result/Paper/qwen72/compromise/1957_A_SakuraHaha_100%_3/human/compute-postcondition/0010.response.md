The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is a list of integers where each integer n_i satisfies 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100, representing the number of sticks in each test case.
- `a` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains n_i integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the lengths of the sticks for the corresponding test case.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines whether it is possible to form a square using the sticks provided. If it is possible, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (the number of test cases), `n` (a list of the number of sticks in each test case), and `a` (a list of lists containing the lengths of the sticks for each test case). It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if it is possible to form a square using the sticks in the corresponding test case, and "No" otherwise.**
