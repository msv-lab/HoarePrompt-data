You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each involving a grid defined by dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of two chips (Alice's and Bob's) on this grid, given by coordinates `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. For each test case, the function determines and prints the result as either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the relative positions of the chips and the grid dimensions. The final state of the function is that all test cases have been processed, and the result for each case has been printed. The variables `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are reset and re-assigned for each test case, and their final values are those from the last test case processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the way it calculates the possible positions for Alice and Bob and checks for a win. Specifically, the logic for determining the `l` and `r` values and the conditions for checking if Alice or Bob wins are incorrect. Here is a case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
6 5 2 2 5 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

### Actual Output:
```
Draw
```

### Explanation:
In this test case, Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob starts at (5, 3). Alice can win by moving to (3, 3) on her first turn, and then Bob will move to (4, 2) or (4, 4). Alice can then move to (4, 3) on her second turn, and Bob will have to move to (3, 2) or (3, 4). Alice can then move to (5, 3) on her third turn, winning the game. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this case.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the possible positions and the conditions for checking if Alice or Bob wins. The program does not correctly simulate the game's rules and the optimal moves for both players.
