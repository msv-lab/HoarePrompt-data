The function `func` accepts a parameter, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the coordinates (x, y) of a corner of the square, and the list contains exactly four tuples. The coordinates x_i and y_i are integers such that -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000. The input list represents the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns the area of the square.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of four tuples, each representing the coordinates (x, y) of a corner of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. It returns the area of the square.**
