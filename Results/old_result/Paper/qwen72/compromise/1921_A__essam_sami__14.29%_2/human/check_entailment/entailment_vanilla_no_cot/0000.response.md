Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine the area of the square. The program calculates the squared distance between two pairs of points and then compares these values to determine the area. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the points being compared are adjacent corners of the square.

To correctly solve the problem, you should identify the side length of the square by finding the minimum distance between any two points that are not the same point. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the side length can be determined by the difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates of the points.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Extract all x and y coordinates
        x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
        y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]
        
        # Find the unique x and y coordinates
        unique_x = set(x_coords)
        unique_y = set(y_coords)
        
        # The side length of the square is the difference between the two unique x or y coordinates
        side_length = (max(unique_x) - min(unique_x))
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length * side_length
        print(area)

# Example usage
# func()
```

This version correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the unique x and y coordinates and then calculates the area based on the side length.
