Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any order. The beauty of the array is maximized when the elements are arranged in a way that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

However, the program provided does not actually rearrange the elements of the array. Instead, it simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This approach is incorrect because the maximum beauty is not necessarily the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the array should be sorted in descending order, and the beauty can be calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in this sorted array. This is because the largest possible difference between consecutive elements is achieved when the largest elements are placed next to the smallest elements.

Given the provided program's logic, it will not produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **False**
