You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, n is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: The loop will print the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each list `nums` for `t` iterations. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading an integer `l` and a list of `l` integers from the input. For each list, it calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The function does not return any value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is not affected by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The program only computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be `2` (as explained in the problem description, the array can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3]` to achieve a beauty of `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`). However, the provided program will output `2` because it computes `max(2, 1, 3) - min(2, 1, 3) = 3 - 1 = 2`, which is coincidentally correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

Consider another input:
```
4
4
3 4 3 3
```
The correct output should be `1` (by rearranging the array to `[3, 4, 3, 3]` or `[4, 3, 3, 3]`, the beauty is `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`). However, the provided program will output `1` because it computes `max(3, 4, 3, 3) - min(3, 4, 3, 3) = 4 - 3 = 1`, which is again coincidentally correct for this specific case but not for all cases.

Now consider a different input:
```
5
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
The correct output should be `8` (by rearranging the array to `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`, the beauty is `(5 - 1) + (2 - 5) + (4 - 2) + (3 - 4) = 4 - 3 + 2 - 1 = 8`). However, the provided program will output `4` because it computes `max(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) - min(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 5 - 1 = 4`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
