### Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, where the beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, starting from the second element to the last. The key insight here is that to maximize the beauty, we should maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the beauty as follows:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

However, the given program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints the difference between them. This approach is incorrect because the maximum beauty is not necessarily the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array.

To see why, consider the example:
- For the array `[1, 2, 3]`, the maximum beauty is `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`.
- The program would print `3 - 1 = 2`, which coincidentally is correct in this case, but this is not a general solution.

Another example:
- For the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, the maximum beauty is `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`.
- The program would print `4 - 3 = 1`, which is correct in this case as well, but again, this is not a general solution.

A correct approach would be to sort the array and then compute the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It only works by coincidence for some specific inputs, but it does not follow the correct logic to maximize the beauty of the array.
