Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, but `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, `x + 1` must be greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `z` is 0.
- The expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates `z` by adding the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value.
- Since `z` is 0, `z // (k - 1)` evaluates to 0 (integer division of 0 by any non-zero integer is 0).
- Therefore, `z += 0 + 1` results in `z` being updated to 1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The conditions `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, but `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, and `x + 1` must be greater than 0 are still valid.
