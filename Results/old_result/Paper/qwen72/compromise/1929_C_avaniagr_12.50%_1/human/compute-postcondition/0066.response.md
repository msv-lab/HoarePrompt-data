The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be at least 0.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 1, `i` is 1**
