Postcondition: ***`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x == k - 1`, the values of the variables remain unchanged. If `x != k - 1`, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `z` is the result of the loop, and `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, the current value of `a` is less than `z`.***
