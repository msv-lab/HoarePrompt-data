Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters `t`, `cases` where `t` is the number of test cases and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ k ≤ 30, 1 ≤ x ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    if x < k - 1:
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    elif x == k - 1:
        if a >= x + 3:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
    else:
        z = 0
        for i in range(x + 1):
            z += z // (k - 1) + 1
        if a >= z:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`, and `x + 1` is greater than `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `a` is less than `z`, `a` is less than `x + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`, and `x + 1` is greater than `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z` (which is `x + 1`), `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `a` is less than `z`, `a` is less than `x + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, and `a` is an input integer. If `x < k - 1`, the variables retain their initial values. If `x == k - 1`, the values of the variables remain unchanged. If `x > k - 1`, `x` must be at least 0, `z` is the result of the loop, and `i` is `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, the current value of `a` is less than `z`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
