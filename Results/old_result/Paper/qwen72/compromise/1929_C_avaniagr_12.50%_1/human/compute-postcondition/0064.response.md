The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. The loop will execute if `x + 1` is greater than 0, which means `x` must be at least 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop and starts at 0.

So, for the loop to execute, `x` must be at least 0, and `i` will be initialized to 0 by the loop.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be at least 0, `a` is an input integer, `z` is 0, `i` is 0**
