The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1` but not equal to `k - 1`, and `x + 1` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `x + 1` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the values of three integers input by the user, `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, but `x` is not equal to `k - 1`, `z` is 2, `i` is 2, `x + 1` must be greater than 2**
