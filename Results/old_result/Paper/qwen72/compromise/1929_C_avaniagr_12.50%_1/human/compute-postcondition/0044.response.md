Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `k` is an integer provided by the user, `x` must be at least 0, `a` is an integer provided by the user, `z` is 2, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The value of `z` is updated by the expression `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`. Initially, `z` is 1. The expression `z // (k - 1)` will be 0 for any integer value of `k` greater than 1, because 1 divided by any positive integer (k - 1) will be 0. Therefore, `z` becomes `1 + 0 + 1`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
