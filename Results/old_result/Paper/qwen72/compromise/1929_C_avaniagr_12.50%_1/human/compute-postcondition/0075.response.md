Postcondition: **_ is 2, t is greater than 2, k is an input integer, x is an input integer that must be at least 0, a is an input integer, z is the result of the loop, and i is x. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `z`. If `a` is less than `z`, the current value of `a` is less than `z`.**
