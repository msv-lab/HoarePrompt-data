The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the range defined by `t`. The loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `t` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers provided by the user. If `x` is less than `k - 1`, then if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 1`. If `x` is greater than or equal to `k - 1`, then if `x` is equal to `k - 1`, if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`, `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`. Otherwise, `a` is less than `x + 3`. If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, then `z` is `x + 1`, `i` is `x`, and `x + 1` is greater than `x`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `z` (which is `x + 1`), `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 1`. If `a` is less than `z`, `a` is less than `x + 1`.**
