Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. If `n` < `k`, no further changes are made to `n` and `k`. If `n` ≥ `k`, and `n` is equal to `k`, no further changes are made. If `n` > `k`, then either `k - 1 < n - k + 1` (implying `k` is less than `n - k + 2`), or `k - 1 ≥ n - k + 1`.***
