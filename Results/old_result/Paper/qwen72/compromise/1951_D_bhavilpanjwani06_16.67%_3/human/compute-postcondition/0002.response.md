Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18.
- `n` is assigned a value from the input which is an integer.
- `k` is assigned a value from the input which is an integer.
- The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.
- `t` is an integer indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.

The code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
