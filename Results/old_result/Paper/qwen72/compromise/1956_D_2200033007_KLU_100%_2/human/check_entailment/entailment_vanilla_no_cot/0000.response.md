Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the maximum sum of the array after performing the operations, but it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it seems to be calculating a different value that is not related to the MEX.

2. **Incorrect Operation Sequence**: The function `func_2` is supposed to generate the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum. However, it does not correctly determine the MEX and apply the operation to the subarray. The logic for deciding the operations is flawed and does not match the problem requirements.

3. **Global Variables**: The program uses global variables `arr` and `res_dict` without initializing them properly. This can lead to undefined behavior and errors.

4. **Stairs Function**: The `make_stairs` function is intended to transform a subarray into a specific pattern, but it is not clear how this pattern is related to the MEX operation. The function also uses a global variable `start_index` which is not defined or passed correctly.

5. **Recursion and State Management**: The program uses recursion but does not manage the state of the array correctly. The array should be modified in place to reflect the operations, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program that should work as intended:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def mex(subarray: List[int]) -> int:
    seen = set(subarray)
    for i in range(len(subarray) + 1):
        if i not in seen:
            return i

def maximize_sum(arr: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, List[Tuple[int, int]]]:
    n = len(arr)
    operations = []
    
    while True:
        max_sum = sum(arr)
        max_mex = 0
        max_range = (0, 0)
        
        for l in range(n):
            for r in range(l, n):
                subarray = arr[l:r+1]
                current_mex = mex(subarray)
                new_sum = sum(arr) - sum(subarray) + current_mex * (r - l + 1)
                if new_sum > max_sum:
                    max_sum = new_sum
                    max_mex = current_mex
                    max_range = (l, r)
        
        if max_range == (0, 0):
            break
        
        operations.append(max_range)
        for i in range(max_range[0], max_range[1] + 1):
            arr[i] = max_mex
    
    return max_sum, operations

# Example usage:
n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
max_sum, operations = maximize_sum(arr)
print(max_sum, len(operations))
for op in operations:
    print(op[0] + 1, op[1] + 1)  # Adjusting indices to be 1-based
```

This corrected version:
- Uses a function `mex` to correctly compute the MEX of a subarray.
- Iterates over all possible subarrays to find the one that maximizes the sum after applying the MEX operation.
- Modifies the array in place and records the operations.
- Ensures that the operations are performed no more than 5 * 10^5 times.

This should correctly solve the problem as described.
