### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` after applying the operation.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, in which case the maximum sum is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
   - The function then tries to split the subarray at different points and computes the maximum sum by considering the MEX of the subarrays.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It recursively checks different splits and compares the results to determine the optimal sequence of operations.
   - If the length of the subarray is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, it calls `make_stairs` and returns the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively constructs the operations for the subarrays.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0).
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and updates the elements to the MEX value.
   - It appends the operation to the result list `res` and updates the array `arr`.

5. **Issues and Concerns**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. It uses a heuristic that does not match the definition of MEX.
   - **Recursion and Splitting**: The recursion in `func_2` and `make_stairs` is not well-defined. The function `make_stairs` is called with a fixed `start_index` which is not updated in the recursive calls.
   - **Global Variables**: The functions `func_2` and `make_stairs` rely on global variables `res` and `arr`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code hard to understand and maintain.
   - **Operation Count**: The program does not ensure that the number of operations is within the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The MEX calculation is incorrect, and the recursive functions do not handle the subarray transformations properly. Additionally, the use of global variables and the lack of a clear operation count mechanism are significant issues.

Correctness: **False**
