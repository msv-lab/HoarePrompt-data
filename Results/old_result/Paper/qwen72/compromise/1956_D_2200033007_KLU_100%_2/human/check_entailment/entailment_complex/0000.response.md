### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves an array of integers and an operation that can be performed to maximize the sum of the elements in the array.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieves this sum.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
     - This function computes the maximum possible sum for the subarray defined by `start_index` to `end_index`.
     - It uses memoization to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
     - If `start_index` equals `end_index`, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
     - Otherwise, it recursively explores different ways to partition the subarray and computes the MEX for each partition, updating the maximum sum accordingly.
     - The function correctly calculates the maximum sum by considering all possible operations and their effects on the subarray.

   - **`func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
     - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum.
     - It first calls `func_1` to get the maximum value for the subarray.
     - If the subarray has a single element that is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`.
     - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" pattern and appends the operation to the result list.
     - Otherwise, it recursively explores different partitions to find the operations that achieve the maximum sum.
     - The function correctly constructs the sequence of operations by backtracking from the maximum sum.

   - **`make_stairs(i)`**:
     - This function modifies the subarray to form a "staircase" pattern.
     - It checks if the subarray already forms a staircase from 0 to `i`.
     - If not, it recursively ensures that the subarray is transformed to have all elements set to `i` and appends the operation to the result list.
     - The function correctly modifies the subarray and appends the necessary operations to achieve the desired pattern.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly uses memoization in `func_1` to avoid redundant calculations and ensure efficient computation of the maximum sum.
   - `func_2` correctly constructs the sequence of operations by backtracking from the maximum sum.
   - `make_stairs` correctly modifies the subarray to form a staircase pattern and appends the necessary operations.
   - The program handles all edge cases, such as single-element subarrays and subarrays that already form a staircase.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and meets the problem description. It efficiently computes the maximum sum and constructs the sequence of operations to achieve this sum.

**Correctness: True**
