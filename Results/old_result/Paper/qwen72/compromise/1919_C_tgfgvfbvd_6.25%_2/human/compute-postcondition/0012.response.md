To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is the first integer in the list `l`.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is 0 if `l[1]` is not greater than `l[0]`, otherwise `b` is `l[1]`.
- `c` is 0.
- `y` is 1.
- If `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for y in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1` (inclusive).
- The loop variable `y` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.
- The loop will continue as long as `y` is less than `n`.

### Adjusting the States:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `y`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, `y` is 1.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The condition for the loop to continue is that `y` must be less than `n`.

### Conclusion:
The state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the increment of `y` and the condition that `n` must still be greater than `y`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is 0 if `l[1]` is not greater than `l[0]`, otherwise `b` is `l[1]`, `c` is 0, `y` is 2, and if `l[1]` is greater than `l[0]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
