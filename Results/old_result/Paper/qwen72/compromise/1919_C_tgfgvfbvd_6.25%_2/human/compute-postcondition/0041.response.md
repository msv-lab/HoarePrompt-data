Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]`, and `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists. If `a` is less than `l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]`, and `a` remains the first integer in the list `l`. Additionally, either `l[x]` is not less than `a` or `l[x]` is not less than `b` (or both).***
