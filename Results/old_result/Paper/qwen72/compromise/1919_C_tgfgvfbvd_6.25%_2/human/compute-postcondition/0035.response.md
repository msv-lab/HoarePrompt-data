Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`. If `a - l[x] <= b - l[x]`, then `a` is updated to `l[x]` and `b` remains the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists. If `a - l[x] > b - l[x]`, then `b` is updated to `l[x]` and `a` remains the first integer in the list `l`. In both cases, `l[x]` is less than the original values of `a` and `b`.***
