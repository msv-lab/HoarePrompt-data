Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + k + 1`, and `x` must be less than `n`, `a` is the value of `l[x]`.** 

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `l[x]` to the variable `a`. The value of `x` is determined by the expression `y + k + 1`, and it must be less than `n`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `y`, `k`) remain unchanged. The new state includes the updated value of `a` which is the element at index `x` in the list `l`.
