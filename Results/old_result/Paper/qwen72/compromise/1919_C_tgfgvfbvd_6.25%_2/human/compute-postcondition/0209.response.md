Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index where the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element is found, or `y` is `n-1` if no such element exists, `y` must be such that `y + 1 < n`, `x` is `y + 3`, and `x` must be less than `n`, `a` is the value of the element at index `x` in `l`, `b` is the value of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element or 0 if no such element exists, and `c` is incremented by 1 if `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, otherwise `a` remains the first element in `l` and `b` is the value of the element `l[x]`.**
