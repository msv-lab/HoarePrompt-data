The only objects in the loop head are the variables `y` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 2, and `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still satisfy the condition 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is 3, `a` is the first element in `l`, `b` is 0, and `c` is 0.**
