Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`l`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`b`**: After the loop completes, `b` will hold the value of the first element in the list `l` that is greater than its previous element. If no such element exists, `b` remains 0.
- **`c`**: Remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`y`**: After the loop completes, `y` will be the index of the first element in the list `l` that is greater than its previous element. If no such element exists, `y` will be `n-1` because the loop will have iterated through all elements without breaking.
