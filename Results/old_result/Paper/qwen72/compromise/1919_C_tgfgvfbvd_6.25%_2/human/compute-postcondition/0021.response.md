To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop:

```python
for x in range(y + 1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head involves the variables `x`, `y`, and `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the range `range(y + 1, n)` is non-empty.
   - For the range to be non-empty, `y + 1` must be less than `n`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - We need to ensure that `y + 1 < n`.
   - This implies that `y` must be less than `n - 1`.

### Given Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 (not relevant to the loop).
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is the first integer in the list `l` (not relevant to the loop).
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists (not directly relevant to the loop, but affects `y`).
- `c` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
- `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or `n-1` if no such element exists.

### Adjusted State:
- To ensure the loop executes, `y` must be less than `n - 1`.
- If `y` is `n - 1`, the loop will not execute because `y + 1` would equal `n`, making the range empty.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is the first integer in the list `l`.
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists.
- `c` is 0.
- `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the first integer in the list `l`, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `b` is the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, or 0 if no such element exists, `c` is 0, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`**
