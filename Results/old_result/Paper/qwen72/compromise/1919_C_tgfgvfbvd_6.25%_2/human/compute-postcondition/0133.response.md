The value of `c` is incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `y + 3 < n`, `c` is increased by 1. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[y + 3]`. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[y + 3]`.**
