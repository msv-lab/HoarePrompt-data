Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its previous element, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + k + 1`, and `x` must be less than `n`. If `l[x] > a` and `l[x] > b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the comparison between `l[x] - a` and `l[x] - b`, and `c` is incremented by 1. If `l[x] < a` and `l[x] < b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the comparison between `a - l[x]` and `b - l[x]`. If `l[x]` is not less than both `a` and `b`, then either `a` or `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]` based on the comparison between `a` and `l[x]`.***
