The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value of the element at index `y` (which is 3) in the list `l` to the variable `b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input
- `y` is 3
- `a` is the first element in `l`
- `c` is 0
- `b` is either the third element in `l` if `l[2] > l[1]`, or 0 otherwise
- `n` must be greater than 3

After executing the code `b = l[y]`:
- `b` is now assigned the value of `l[3]` (since `y` is 3).

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5
- `l` is a list of integers read from the input
- `y` is 3
- `a` is the first element in `l`
- `c` is 0
- `b` is the fourth element in `l` (since `l[3]` is the fourth element in the list)
- `n` must be greater than 3

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 < n ≤ 2·10^5, `l` is a list of integers read from the input, `y` is 3, `a` is the first element in `l`, `c` is 0, `b` is the fourth element in `l`, `n` must be greater than 3.**
