The code snippet `l = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores the resulting list in the variable `l`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n

After executing the code snippet, the variable `l` will contain a list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `l` is a list of integers read from the input.**
