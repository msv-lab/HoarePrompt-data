t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, m is an integer such that 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and for each of the m lines, a_i, b_i, and f_i are integers where a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
