### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` as \(10^9 + 7\), which is a common modulus used in competitive programming to avoid large numbers and ensure results fit within standard integer ranges.
   - It calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). This is correct because the teacher chooses pairs equiprobably, and the total number of pairs is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `a` of all pairs of friends.
   - This is done by reading `m` lines, each containing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value, and adding these values to `a`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - The program then iterates over `k` excursions and calculates the expected sum of friendship values.
   - For each excursion, it updates `s` by adding the expected increase in friendship value.
   - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is calculated as `c * i * c * m + c * a`.
     - `c * i * c * m` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the increase in the friendship value of pairs chosen in previous excursions.
     - `c * a` represents the expected increase in friendship value due to the initial friendship values of the pairs.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic to ensure that all intermediate results and the final result are within the range of \(10^9 + 7\).
   - The final result is printed as `s % M`.

5. **Efficiency and Constraints:**
   - The program efficiently handles the constraints by using modular inverse and modular arithmetic, which are necessary for large values of `n` and `k`.
   - The time complexity is \(O(m + k)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

6. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula used to update `s` is correct. The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion is indeed the sum of the expected increase due to previous excursions and the initial friendship values.
   - The use of the modular inverse `c` ensures that the probability of choosing any pair is correctly accounted for.

### Detailed Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` can be broken down as follows:
  - `c * a` is the expected increase in the sum of friendship values due to the initial friendship values of the pairs. This is correct because the probability of choosing any pair is \(\frac{1}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\), and there are `m` pairs, so the expected increase is \(\frac{a}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\).
  - `c * i * c * m` is the expected increase in the sum of friendship values due to the increase in the friendship value of pairs chosen in previous excursions. This is incorrect because it assumes that the friendship value of each pair increases by `i` in each subsequent excursion, which is not the case. The correct formula should account for the cumulative increase in friendship values over all excursions.

### Correct Formula:
- The correct formula for the expected sum of friendship values after `k` excursions should be:
  - The initial sum of friendship values: `a`.
  - The expected increase in friendship value for each excursion: `c * a` (since the friendship value of each pair increases by 1 if chosen, and the probability of choosing any pair is `c`).
  - The total expected increase over `k` excursions: `k * c * a`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        s = (k * c * a) % M
        
        print(s)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect in the formula used to update `s`. The formula `c * i * c * m + c * a` does not correctly account for the cumulative increase in friendship values over all excursions. The corrected formula `k * c * a` should be used instead.

Final: **False**
