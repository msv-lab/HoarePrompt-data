### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input and initializes the necessary variables.

2. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs of children, and the modular inverse is used to compute the probability of selecting a specific pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The variable `a` is used to accumulate the sum of initial friendship values `f` for all pairs of friends. This is done correctly by iterating over the `m` pairs and adding their friendship values.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The variable `s` is used to accumulate the expected sum of friendship values over `k` excursions.
   - The loop iterates `k` times, and for each iteration, it updates `s` as follows:
     - `c * i * c * m`: This term calculates the expected increase in friendship value for the current iteration. However, this term is incorrect. The expected increase in friendship value for each pair of friends should be `c * m` (the probability of selecting a friend pair) times the current iteration number `i` (since the friendship value increases by 1 for each selection).
     - `c * a`: This term correctly adds the expected contribution of the initial friendship values to the total sum.

5. **Output:**
   - The final result `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is correct for the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program has a logical error in the expected value calculation. Specifically, the term `c * i * c * m` should be `c * m * (i + 1)` to correctly account for the expected increase in friendship value for each iteration. The current implementation incorrectly multiplies `c` twice, which is not necessary and leads to an incorrect result.

Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
