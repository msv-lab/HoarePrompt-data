Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`. If `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, then `coef0[j]` is set to `r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]`, `coef1[j]` is set to `-coef1[i]`, and the function `dfs` has been called with `j` as an argument. Otherwise, the values of `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` remain unchanged.***
