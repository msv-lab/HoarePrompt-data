Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[i]` is set to `True`, `j` is set to `n-1`, and for all `j` from 0 to `n-1`, if `visited[j]` is `False` and `(r[i] + r[j])` is less than a certain condition (which is not fully provided in the fragment), some operation is performed. If `visited[i]` is `True`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
