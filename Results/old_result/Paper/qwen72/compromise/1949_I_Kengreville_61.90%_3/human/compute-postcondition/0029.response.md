Output State: **`nodes` must have at least 2 elements, `j` is the second element in `nodes`, `c0` is increased by `coef0[j]`, `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]` twice.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c1 += coef1[j]` increases the value of `c1` by `coef1[j]` again. Since the initial state already mentioned that `c1` is increased by `coef1[j]`, after executing this code, `c1` is now increased by `coef1[j]` twice. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
