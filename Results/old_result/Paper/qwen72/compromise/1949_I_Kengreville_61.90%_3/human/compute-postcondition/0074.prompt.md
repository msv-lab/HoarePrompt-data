Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain `[False] * n`, `[None] * n`, and `[None] * n` respectively, and `nodes` remains an empty list. `ok` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if not visited[i]:
        coef0[i] = 0
        coef1[i] = 1
        nodes = []
        dfs(i)
        c0 = 0
        c1 = 0
        for j in nodes:
            c0 += coef0[j]
            c1 += coef1[j]
        ok = ok or c1 != 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 0, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain `[False] * n`, `[None] * n`, and `[None] * n` respectively, and `nodes` remains an empty list. If `visited[i]` is `False`, `c0` is increased by the sum of `coef0[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is increased by the sum of `coef1[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is now `True` if `c1` is not equal to 0. Otherwise, `ok` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`, and `nodes` must contain all the elements that were added to it before the loop started. If `visited[i]` is `False`, `c0` is increased by the sum of `coef0[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is increased by the sum of `coef1[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is `[False] * n`, and if `i` (which is 2) was not visited, `visited[2]` is set to `True`. `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` being 0, and if `i` was not visited, `coef0[2]` is also set to 0. `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` being 1, and if `i` was not visited, `coef1[2]` is also set to 1. `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and if `i` was not visited, `c0` remains unchanged. `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for each `j` in `nodes`, and if `i` was not visited, `c1` is increased by 2. `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`. `nodes` is a list that can contain any number of elements, and if `i` was not visited, `nodes` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
