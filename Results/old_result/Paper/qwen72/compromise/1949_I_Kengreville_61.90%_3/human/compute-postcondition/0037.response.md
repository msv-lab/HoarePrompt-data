Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 1, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. The lists `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` remain `[False] * n`, `[None] * n`, and `[None] * n` respectively, and `nodes` remains an empty list. `coef0[i]` is now 0. If `visited[i]` is `False`, `c0` is increased by the sum of `coef0[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, `c1` is increased by the sum of `coef1[j]` for all elements `j` in `nodes`, and `ok` is now `True` if `c1` is not equal to 0. Otherwise, `ok` remains `False`.**
