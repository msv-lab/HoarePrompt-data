Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is `n-1`, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces. `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding index was visited during the loop, otherwise it remains `False`. `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef0[i]` is 0 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`. `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element `coef1[i]` is 1 if the corresponding index was visited, otherwise it remains `None`. `nodes` is a list that can contain any number of elements, and it will be populated with indices that were visited during the loop. `c0` is the sum of all `coef0[j]` for `j` in `nodes`, and `c1` is the sum of all `coef1[j]` for `j` in `nodes`. `ok` is `True` if `c1` is not 0, otherwise `ok` remains `False`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `i` will be `n-1`.
- The lists `x`, `y`, and `r` will still contain the values assigned by the user.
- The list `visited` will have `True` for each index that was visited during the loop, and `False` for any index that was not visited.
- The list `coef0` will have 0 for each index that was visited, and `None` for any index that was not visited.
- The list `coef1` will have 1 for each index that was visited, and `None` for any index that was not visited.
- The list `nodes` will contain the indices of all elements that were visited during the loop.
- The variable `c0` will be the sum of all 0s in `coef0` for the indices in `nodes`, which will always be 0.
- The variable `c1` will be the sum of all 1s in `coef1` for the indices in `nodes`, which will be the number of visited indices.
- The variable `ok` will be `True` if any indices were visited (i.e., `c1` is not 0), otherwise it will remain `False`.
