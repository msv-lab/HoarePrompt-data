Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `i` is 2, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element `x[i]`, `y[i]`, and `r[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `n-1`) is assigned the value of three integers input by the user, split by spaces, `visited` is `[False] * n` with `visited[2]` being `True`, `coef0` is `[None] * n` with `coef0[1]` and `coef0[2]` being 0, `coef1` is `[None] * n` with `coef1[1]` and `coef1[2]` being 1, `c0` is `0 + coef0[j] + coef0[j]`, `c1` is `1 + coef1[j] + coef1[j]`, `ok` is `False`, `nodes` is a list that must contain at least two elements, `j` is the second element in `nodes`.**
