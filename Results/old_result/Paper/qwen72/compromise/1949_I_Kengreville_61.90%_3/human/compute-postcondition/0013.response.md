Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= i < n, `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `x` and `y` are lists of integers of length n, `r` is a list of positive integers of length n, `visited` is a list of booleans of length n where `visited[i]` is `True`, `dx` is the integer value of `x[i] - x[1]`, `dy` is the integer value of `y[i] - y[1]`.** 

The value of `dy` is calculated as the difference between the integer at index `i` of the list `y` and the integer at index `1` of the list `y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
