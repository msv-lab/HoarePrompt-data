You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `dfs(i)` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from the node at index `i`. It updates the `visited` list to mark nodes as visited and appends the indices of visited nodes to the `nodes` list. Additionally, for each unvisited node `j` that satisfies the condition `(r[i] + r[j])+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a set of disks in the plane with integer coordinates and positive integer radii.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks such that:
     - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
     - No two disks overlap.
     - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   - The output should be `YES` if it is possible to change the radii as required, otherwise `NO`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the connected components of the graph formed by the disks.
   - Each disk is represented as a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent.
   - The program attempts to assign coefficients to each disk such that the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency.

4. **Key Steps**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `n` is the number of disks.
     - `x`, `y`, and `r` are arrays to store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
     - `visited` is an array to keep track of visited disks.
     - `coef0` and `coef1` are arrays to store coefficients for each disk.
     - `nodes` is a list to store the nodes in the current connected component.

   - **DFS Function**:
     - The `dfs` function is used to explore the connected component starting from disk `i`.
     - It marks the disk `i` as visited and appends it to the `nodes` list.
     - For each disk `j` that is tangent to disk `i` (i.e., the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii), it updates the coefficients and recursively calls `dfs` on disk `j`.

   - **Main Function**:
     - The program iterates over all disks and performs a DFS on each unvisited disk.
     - After the DFS, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the nodes in the current connected component.
     - If `c1` (the sum of `coef1` values) is non-zero, it means there is a way to change the radii such that the sum of radii decreases, and the program sets `ok` to `True`.
     - Finally, if `ok` is `True`, the program prints `YES`; otherwise, it prints `NO`.

5. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The program correctly identifies the connected components of the graph formed by the disks.
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are used to ensure that the tangency condition is maintained.
   - The condition `c1 != 0` ensures that there is a non-trivial way to change the radii such that the sum of radii decreases.
   - However, the program does not explicitly check for the non-overlapping condition, but this is implicitly handled by the tangency condition and the fact that the radii are positive real numbers.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no disks (i.e., `n = 0`) by not entering the loop.
   - It also handles the case where there is only one disk (i.e., `n = 1`) by correctly setting `ok` to `False` since there is no way to decrease the sum of radii with a single disk.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and should work for the given problem description. It correctly identifies the connected components and checks if the radii can be adjusted to meet the required conditions.

Correctness: **True**
