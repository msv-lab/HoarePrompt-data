### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and initializes the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`.
   - The input format is correctly handled, and the lists are populated with the coordinates and radii of the disks.

2. **DFS Function:**
   - The `dfs` function is called for each disk that has not been visited.
   - The function marks the current disk as visited and appends its index to the `nodes` list.
   - It then iterates over all other disks to find those that are tangent to the current disk. The condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` ensures that the disks are tangent.
   - For each tangent disk, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists and recursively calls `dfs` on the tangent disk.

3. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After the DFS traversal, the program calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for the visited disks.
   - The program checks if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero. If it is non-zero, it means that there is a way to change the radii such that the sum of all radii strictly decreases while maintaining tangency and non-overlap.
   - If `c1` is zero, it means that the system of equations derived from the tangency conditions does not allow a non-trivial solution, and thus the radii cannot be changed as required.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' if it is possible to change the radii and 'NO' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Incomplete Condition in DFS:**
  - The comment in the `dfs` function mentions an incomplete condition: `if (r[i] + r[j])` is less than a certain condition (which is not fully provided in the fragment). However, the actual condition used in the code is `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`, which correctly checks for tangency.
- **coef0 and coef1 Initialization:**
  - The `coef0` and `coef1` lists are initialized to `[None] * n` and `[None] * n` respectively, but they are later set to `0` and `1` for the first disk in each connected component. This is correct, but the initialization to `None` is unnecessary and could be simplified to `[0] * n` and `[1] * n`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if the radii of the disks can be changed as required. The DFS traversal correctly identifies connected components of tangent disks, and the program checks if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, which is a valid approach to determine if a non-trivial solution exists.
