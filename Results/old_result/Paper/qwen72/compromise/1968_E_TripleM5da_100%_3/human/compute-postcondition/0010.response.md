Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is `n`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the same value as `n`. This is because the loop starts at `i = 3` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged, as it is only used as the upper bound for the loop and is not modified within the loop body.
