The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, the range `3` to `n + 1` must contain at least one integer. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. The variable `i` is not used outside the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0**
