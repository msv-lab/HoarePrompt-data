The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4**
