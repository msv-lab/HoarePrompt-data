Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3.
- `i` is 0.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(i, i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly defined as 0 in the initial state, the `print` statement will output the value of `i` twice.

Output: **0, 0**
