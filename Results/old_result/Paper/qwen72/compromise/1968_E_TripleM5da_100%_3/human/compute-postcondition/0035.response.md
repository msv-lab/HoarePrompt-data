Functionality: ** The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, and prints a series of pairs of integers. Specifically, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and then for each integer `i` from 3 to `n` (inclusive), it prints (i, i). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the pairs of integers have been printed for each `n` in the test cases. **
