The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 4, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 4**
