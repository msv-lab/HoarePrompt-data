The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `int(input()) - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50
- For each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3

We need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the state of `i` and the input value.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, for each of the `t` test cases, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
