Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of lists a, where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), each n[i] is the number of sticks for the i-th test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 100), and each a[i] is a list of stick lengths for the i-th test case, with each stick length a[i][j] being an integer (1 ≤ a[i][j] ≤ 100).**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, n, a):
```

This ensures that the function can accept the required inputs as described in the problem.
