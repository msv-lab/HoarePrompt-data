To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is the number of test cases, and it is given that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers where each element \(a[j]\) is an integer and \(1 \leq a[j] \leq 100\).
   - `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
   - `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4.

2. **Understanding `cnt` and `ans`:**
   - The dictionary `cnt` is constructed by counting the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - For each key in `cnt`, the value is the count of how many times the corresponding integer appears in `a`.
   - `ans` is calculated by summing the floor division of each count in `cnt` by 4. The floor division operation `//` returns the largest integer less than or equal to the division result.

3. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `a` is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]`.
   - The dictionary `cnt` would be:
     ```python
     cnt = {1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 4, 4: 5}
     ```
   - The floor division of each count by 4:
     - \(1 // 4 = 0\)
     - \(2 // 4 = 0\)
     - \(4 // 4 = 1\)
     - \(5 // 4 = 1\)
   - Summing these results:
     ```python
     ans = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2
     ```

4. **General Case:**
   - For any list `a` where each element is an integer between 1 and 100, the dictionary `cnt` will contain the counts of these integers.
   - The value of `ans` will be the sum of the floor division of each count in `cnt` by 4.
   - The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific counts of each integer in `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the floor division of each count in `cnt` by 4.
   - Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each count in cnt by 4)**
