Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it only considers the possibility of forming squares (4-sided polygons) and does not account for the possibility of forming other regular polygons with different numbers of sides (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.). The problem statement requires finding the maximum number of regular polygons, not just squares.

To correct this, the program should iterate over all possible regular polygons (from 3 sides up to the maximum number of sides that can be formed with the given sticks) and determine the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        for sides in range(3, n + 1):
            ans += x // sides
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

However, this corrected version is still not optimal because it counts the same stick multiple times for different polygons, which is not allowed. A more efficient and correct approach would be to consider the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each stick length and then sum these values.

Here is a more optimal and correct version:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        for sides in range(3, min(n + 1, x + 1)):
            ans += x // sides
    print(ans)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed for each stick length, considering all possible polygon sides from 3 up to the number of sticks of that length.
