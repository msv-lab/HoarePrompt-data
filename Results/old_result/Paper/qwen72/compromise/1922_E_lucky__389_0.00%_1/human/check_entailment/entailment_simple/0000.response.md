### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the integer `x` for the current test case.
   - It subtracts 1 from `x` to handle the fact that an empty subsequence is also considered an increasing subsequence.

3. **Subsequence Length Calculation:**
   - The program uses a while loop to determine the lengths of the subsequences that will contribute to the total number of increasing subsequences.
   - It iterates through powers of 2 to find the largest `i` such that \(2^{i+1} \leq x + 1\).
   - It appends `i` to the list `subseq_lens` and subtracts \(2^i - 1\) from `x`.
   - This process continues until `x` becomes 0.

4. **Array Construction:**
   - The program constructs an array `ansv` that contains integers from 0 to `mx - 1`, where `mx` is the maximum value in `subseq_lens`.
   - It then appends the values from `subseq_lens` starting from the second element to `ansv`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the constructed array `ansv`.
   - It then prints the elements of `ansv` on a single line, separated by spaces.
   - Finally, it prints a new line to separate the output for different test cases.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Subsequence Length Calculation:**
  - The logic to find the lengths of the subsequences is correct. It ensures that the sum of \(2^i - 1\) for all `i` in `subseq_lens` equals the initial value of `x`.
  - This approach is based on the fact that the number of increasing subsequences in an array of length `i` is \(2^i - 1\).

- **Array Construction:**
  - The array `ansv` is constructed to have the required number of increasing subsequences.
  - The initial part of `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx - 1`, which ensures that the array has a strictly increasing subsequence.
  - The subsequent elements from `subseq_lens` are appended to `ansv`, which helps in forming the required number of increasing subsequences.

- **Output Constraints:**
  - The length of the array `ansv` is at most 200, which satisfies the problem constraint.
  - The elements of `ansv` are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\), which also satisfies the problem constraint.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem description and constraints. It constructs an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for each test case, and the output format is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
