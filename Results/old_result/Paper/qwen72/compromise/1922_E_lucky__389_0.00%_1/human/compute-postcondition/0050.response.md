Output State: **`i` is the highest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\) before the execution, `x` is now `x - (2^{i+1} - 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value between the previous `mx` and `i`.** 

The value of `i` remains the same, as it is the highest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\) before the execution. The value of `x` is updated to `x - (2^{i+1} - 1)`. The value of `mx` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `mx` and `i`.
