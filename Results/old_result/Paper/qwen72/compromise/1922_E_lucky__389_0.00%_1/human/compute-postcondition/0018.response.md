Output State: **`x` is an input integer minus 2^i, `x` must be greater than or equal to 2^i - 1, `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the integer `i`, `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i`, and `i` is the largest integer such that 2^i - 1 â‰¤ x, and `i` is greater than 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value (0) and the value of `i`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
