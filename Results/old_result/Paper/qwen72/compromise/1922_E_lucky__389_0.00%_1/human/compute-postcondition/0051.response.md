Postcondition: ***`i` is the highest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\), `x` is the input integer minus 1, and `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and the final value of `i`. If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `x` is updated to `x - (2^{i+1} - 1)` and `mx` is the maximum value between the previous `mx` and `i`.***
