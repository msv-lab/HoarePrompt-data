The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `subseq_lens`. Therefore, we can only adjust these.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least two integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 to 2, and `subseq_lens` must still have at least two integers, but since `i` is now 2, the list must have at least three integers for the loop to continue.

State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing at least three integers, `i` is 2, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1, and `ansv` now includes the integer at index 1 of `subseq_lens`.**
