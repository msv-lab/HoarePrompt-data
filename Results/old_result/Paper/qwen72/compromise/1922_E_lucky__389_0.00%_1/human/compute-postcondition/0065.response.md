Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1.
   - `ansv` must have at least two elements.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ansv[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `ansv`.
   - Since `i` is 1, it will print the second element of `ansv`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine the Value of `ansv[i]`:**
   - `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1.
   - The second element of `ansv` (index 1) is the integer 1, because the list starts from 0 and increments by 1.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the integer 1 followed by a space.

Output: **1 **
