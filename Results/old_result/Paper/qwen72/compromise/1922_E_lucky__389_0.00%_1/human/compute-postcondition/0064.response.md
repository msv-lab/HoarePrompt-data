The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `ansv`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `ansv`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1 with at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `ansv` must have at least two elements.

State: **`i` is 1, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1, and `ansv` must have at least two elements**
