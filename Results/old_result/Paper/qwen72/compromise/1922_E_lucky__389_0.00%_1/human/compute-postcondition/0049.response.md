Output State: **`i` is the highest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\) before the execution, `x` is now `x - (2 ** i - 1)`, `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and the final value of `i`, `subseq_lens` includes the final value of `i`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^i - 1\) from its current value.
- The value of `i` remains the highest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\) before the execution.
- The value of `mx` is still the maximum of the previous `mx` and the final value of `i`.
- The list `subseq_lens` still includes the final value of `i`.
- `i` is still not equal to 0.
