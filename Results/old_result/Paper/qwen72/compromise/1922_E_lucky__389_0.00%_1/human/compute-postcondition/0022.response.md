To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

The loop condition is:
```
while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
```

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to \(2^i - 1\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mx` is the maximum of 0 and `i` (which is 0).
   - `subseq_lens` is a list.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop will execute if \(2^{(i + 1)} \leq x + 1\).
   - Substituting `i` with 0, the condition becomes \(2^{(0 + 1)} \leq x + 1\), which simplifies to \(2 \leq x + 1\).
   - This further simplifies to \(1 \leq x\).

3. **Adjusting the State:**
   - The variable `i` is already 0, which is a valid starting point.
   - The variable `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Given the initial state where `x` is an input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to \(2^i - 1\), and knowing that `i` is 0, we can deduce that `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop can execute the first time is:
State: **`x` is an input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `mx` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list**.
