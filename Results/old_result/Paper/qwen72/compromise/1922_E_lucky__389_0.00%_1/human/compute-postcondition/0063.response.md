Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx` - 1.
   - `ansv` must have at least one element.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ansv[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is 0, so `ansv[i]` will access the first element of the list `ansv`.
   - The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx` - 1. Since `ansv` must have at least one element, the first element of `ansv` is 0.
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `ansv[i]` followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Output:**
   - The first element of `ansv` is 0.
   - The `print` statement will output `0` followed by a space.

Output: **0 **
