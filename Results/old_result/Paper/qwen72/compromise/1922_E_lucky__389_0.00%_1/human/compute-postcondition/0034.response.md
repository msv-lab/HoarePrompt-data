Output State: **`i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\), `x` is now equal to `x - (2^{i+1} - 1)`, and `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` and `i`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains the largest integer such that \(2^{(i+1)} - 1 \leq x\).
- The value of `x` is updated to `x - (2^{i+1} - 1)`.
- The value of `mx` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i`.
