The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies -10^9 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. The function returns `total_max_segment`, which is the segment with the maximum sum found during the iteration. If the length of `total_max_segment` is 1, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the segment with the maximum sum found during the iteration. If the length of this segment is 1, it returns `[-1]`.**
