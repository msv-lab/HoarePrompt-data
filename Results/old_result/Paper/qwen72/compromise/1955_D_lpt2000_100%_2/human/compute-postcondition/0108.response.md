The value of `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. All other variables (`fnd`, `D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, `n`, `in_aa`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`fnd` remains the same or is incremented by 1 depending on the condition, `D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, and `n` remain the same, `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1.**
