Output State: **`fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. `D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, and `n` remain the same. `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0 and `E[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` > 0 and `E[out_aa]` <= 0, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**
