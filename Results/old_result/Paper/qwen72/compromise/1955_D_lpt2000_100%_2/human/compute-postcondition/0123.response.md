The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `nabors`. The loop iterates based on the value of `nabors`. Since the loop has completed all iterations, the value of `_` would have reached the last valid index (which is `nabors - 1`), and the loop condition would no longer be satisfied (i.e., `_` is no longer less than `nabors`).

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `nabors` must be such that the loop condition is satisfied again. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable and its value is not tracked explicitly, the key adjustment needed is to ensure that `nabors` is greater than the number of iterations already completed.

If the loop has completed `nabors` iterations, to execute one more time, `nabors` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`nabors` must be incremented by 1**
