The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into three parts, converting each part to an integer and assigning them to `n`, `m`, and `k`. The variable `nabors` is not directly affected by this code, but according to the initial state, it must be incremented by 1.

Output State: **`nabors` is incremented by 1, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers from the input.**
