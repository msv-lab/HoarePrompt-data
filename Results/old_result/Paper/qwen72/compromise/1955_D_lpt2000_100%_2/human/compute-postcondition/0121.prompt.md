Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `D` is updated to contain the intersection (minimum counts) of the elements in `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`. `pairs_in_D` is the sum of the values in `D`. `E` is updated to contain the elements in `cnt_aa` that are not in `D` (i.e., `cnt_aa - D`). `C` is updated to contain the elements in `cnt_bb` that are not in `D` (i.e., `cnt_bb - D`). `fnd` is 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` is 0. All other variables (`aa`, `nabors`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `bb`, `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`) remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
    if D[out_aa] > 0:
        if E[out_aa] > 0:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        else:
            D[out_aa] -= 1
            pairs_in_D -= 1
            C[out_aa] += 1
    else:
        E[out_aa] -= 1
    if C[in_aa] > 0:
        D[in_aa] += 1
        pairs_in_D += 1
        C[in_aa] -= 1
    else:
        E[in_aa] += 1
    fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. All other variables (`D`, `pairs_in_D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, `n`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`) retain their previous values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: If `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `fnd` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. The values of `D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, `n`, `in_aa`, and `out_aa` remain the same.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `pairs_in_D` is greater than or equal to `k`; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. `D`, `E`, `C`, `m`, and `n` remain the same. `in_aa` is the next element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the next element in `aa[:n - m]`. If `D[out_aa]` > 0 and `E[out_aa]` > 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` > 0 and `E[out_aa]` <= 0, `D[out_aa]` is decremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is decremented by 1, and `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa]` > 0, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1, `pairs_in_D` is incremented by 1, and `C[in_aa]` is decremented by 1. Otherwise, `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
