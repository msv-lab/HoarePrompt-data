### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input.
   - `func_14()` is called for each test case, and it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns the string '1\n2'. This is a special case where the sequence `[1]` is valid because it can form a subsequence sum of 1 but not 2.
   - If `k == 1` and `n != 2`, the function constructs a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8]` which is a specific sequence that meets the criteria for `k == 1`. This sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - For `k > 1`, the function constructs a sequence `ans` that meets the criteria:
     - It starts by adding powers of 2 from `2^0` to `2^(lk-2)` where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that all other values up to `n` can be formed.
     - Finally, it adds powers of 2 from `2^lk` to `2^(l-1)` where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The function `func_15()` iterates over the number of test cases and prints the result of `func_14()` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Solution:
- **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
  - The sequence is constructed in such a way that it avoids any subsequence summing to `k`. For `k > 1`, the sequence is built to ensure that the sum of any subsequence does not equal `k`.
- **All Other Values from 1 to `n`**:
  - The sequence is designed to include all necessary values to form any sum from 1 to `n` except `k`. This is achieved by including powers of 2 and specific values that cover the range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements and ensures that the sequence meets the conditions for all test cases. The special cases and general case handling are both implemented correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
