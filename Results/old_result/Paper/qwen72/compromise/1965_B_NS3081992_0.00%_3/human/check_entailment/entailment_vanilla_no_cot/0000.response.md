Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The function `func_14` attempts to generate a sequence based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`, but it does not ensure that the sequence meets the required conditions:

1. There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

The function `func_14` has a few issues:
- It does not handle the case where `k` is not a power of 2 correctly.
- It does not ensure that the sequence can form all other sums `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`.
- The sequence generated may exceed the size limit of 25.

A correct solution would need to carefully construct a sequence that meets both conditions for all valid `n` and `k`. The provided solution does not do this reliably, and thus it is incorrect.
