Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of the new `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the new `b`, `k` is equal to 1, `ans` is [2, 3], and `n` is not equal to 2.**

The code snippet `ans = [2, 3]` updates the variable `ans` to the list `[2, 3]`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain as they were updated by `func_7()`, and `k` is still equal to 1. The condition that `n` is not equal to 2 remains valid.
