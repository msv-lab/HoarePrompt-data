The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `lk`. To ensure the loop executes, the condition `lk - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `lk` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, so it does not need to be adjusted. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`
- `b` is the binary representation of the new `n` without the '0b' prefix
- `l` is the length of the new `b`
- `k` is not equal to 1
- `bk` is the binary representation of the new `k` without the '0b' prefix
- `ans` is an empty list
- `lk` is the length of `bk`

To ensure the loop executes, `lk` must be greater than 1. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect this condition.

State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, `b` is the binary representation of the new `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the new `b`, `k` is not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of the new `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 0**
