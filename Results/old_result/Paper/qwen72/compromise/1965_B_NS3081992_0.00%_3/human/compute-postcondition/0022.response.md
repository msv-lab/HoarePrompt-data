Output State: **The program returns a string that is a space-separated list of integers. If `k` was 1, the list is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, the list contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2))`, then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).**
