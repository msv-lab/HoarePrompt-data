The function `func_14` accepts no parameters and returns a string. The function internally uses the values of `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^6, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, the function returns a string that is a space-separated list of integers `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. If `k` is greater than 1, the function returns a string that is a space-separated list of integers. This list contains powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2))`, then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and finally, powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` and `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
