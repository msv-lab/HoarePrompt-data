Output State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{i} - 1\), `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `1`, `mx` is `1`, `i` is `0`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `0`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside.
