You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer X (2 \le X \le 10^{18}) as input, and the integer t (1 \le t \le 1000) representing the number of test cases. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, X):` where t is the number of test cases and X is the integer for each test case.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences subtracted from `x` during the loop, and `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with all elements of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to `len(subseq_lens) - 1` appended, `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: - The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of `ansv`.
    #
    #Given the initial state, the length of `ansv` is calculated as:
    #- `mx + (len(subseq_lens) - 1)`
    #
    #Output:
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: `x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least `len(subseq_lens)` elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, `ansv` must have at least `len(subseq_lens) + mx - 1` elements, `i` is `len(ansv) - 1`.
    print()
    #This is printed: (a newline character)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t` (the number of test cases) and `X` (an integer for each test case). It returns a result based on the value of `X` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
