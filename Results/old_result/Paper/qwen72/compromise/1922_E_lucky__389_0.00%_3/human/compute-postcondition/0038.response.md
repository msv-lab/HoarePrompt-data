To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the program state right before the loop.

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `x` is now `x - (2^i - 1)`
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`
- `mx` is `i`
- `i` is 0

### Loop Condition:
```
while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition depends on `i` and `x`.

2. **Evaluate the Condition with the Current State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - The condition becomes: `2 ** (0 + 1) <= x + 1`.
   - Simplifying, we get: `2 <= x + 1`.

3. **Determine the Required State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `2 <= x + 1` must be true.
   - This simplifies to: `1 <= x`.

### Conclusion:
- The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1.
- Since `x` is currently `x - (2^i - 1)`, and `i` is 0, `x` is `x - (2^0 - 1)`, which simplifies to `x - 0`, so `x` remains `x`.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `x` is at least 1.

### Final State:
State: **`x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is `i`, and `i` is 0**
