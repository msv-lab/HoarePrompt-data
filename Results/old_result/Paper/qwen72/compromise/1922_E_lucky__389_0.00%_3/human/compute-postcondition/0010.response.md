To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition: `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

### Current State:
- `x` is now `x - 1` and must be at least 3.
- `subseq_lens` is an empty list.
- `mx` is 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `x` must be at least 1.

### Loop Condition:
The loop condition is `2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is 2.
   - `x` is `x - 1` and must be at least 3, so the current value of `x` is at least 2 (since it was `x` and is now `x - 1`).

2. **Evaluate the Loop Condition**:
   - The current condition is `2 ** (2 + 1) <= x + 1`, which simplifies to `2 ** 3 <= x + 1` or `8 <= x + 1`.
   - This means `x` must be at least 7 for the loop to execute again.

3. **Adjust the State**:
   - Since `x` is currently at least 2 (after being decremented by 1), we need to ensure that `x` is at least 7 for the next iteration.
   - The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `x`.

### Conclusion:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be at least 7.

### Final State:
State: **`x` is now `x - 1` and must be at least 7, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` must be at least 1**.
