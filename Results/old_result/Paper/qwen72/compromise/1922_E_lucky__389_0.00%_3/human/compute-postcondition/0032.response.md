The code `subseq_lens.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the list `subseq_lens`. The value of `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i - 1 <= x`, and `i` is not equal to 0. The other variables (`x`, `mx`, and the condition that `x` must be greater than or equal to `2^i - 1`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is now `x - 1` and must be greater than or equal to `2^i - 1`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i - 1 <= x`, and `i` is not equal to 0.**
