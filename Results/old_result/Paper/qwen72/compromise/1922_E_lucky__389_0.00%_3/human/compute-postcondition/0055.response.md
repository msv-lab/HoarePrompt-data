Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of sub-sequences and must have at least 2 elements, `mx` is the maximum length of these sub-sequences, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with `subseq_lens[1]` appended, `i` is 1.**

The value of `subseq_lens[1]` is appended to the list `ansv`. The other variables (`x`, `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
