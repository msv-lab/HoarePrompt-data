Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the input format as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem states that the first line of input contains the number of test cases `t`, and this value is used to iterate over multiple test cases. However, the function `func_1` reads the input directly without considering the number of test cases, which means it will only process the first test case and ignore the rest.

To illustrate, consider the following input:
```
5
2 2
3 2
10 4
13 4
7 4
```
The program will only read and process the first test case (`2 2`) and will not proceed to the next test cases. This violates the requirement to handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

Additionally, the function `func_1` does not validate the input constraints (e.g., ensuring `k` is even and within the specified range). While this might not cause the program to fail in all cases, it is still a potential issue that could lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not well-formed.

Therefore, the program is incorrect due to its failure to handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description.
