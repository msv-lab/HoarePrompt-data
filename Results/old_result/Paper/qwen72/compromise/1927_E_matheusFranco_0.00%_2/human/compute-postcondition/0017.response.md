Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` with `permutation[0]` set to 1, `permutation[k]` set to 2, and `permutation[3 * k]` set to 3, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 4, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `3 * k` and `3 * k` must be less than `len(permutation)`**.

Explanation:
- The code snippet `curr_v += 1` increments the value of `curr_v` by 1.
- Initially, `curr_v` was 3, so after the increment, `curr_v` becomes 4.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, `i`, `multiples_of_k_plus_i`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions and constraints specified in the initial state are still valid.
