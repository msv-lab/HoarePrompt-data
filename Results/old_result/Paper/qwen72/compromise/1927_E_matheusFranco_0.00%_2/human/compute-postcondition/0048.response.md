The only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. If `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is less than `len(permutation)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and it is stated that `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must still be less than `len(permutation)` after being increased by `k`. This condition is already met as per the given state, so no further adjustment is necessary.

State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
