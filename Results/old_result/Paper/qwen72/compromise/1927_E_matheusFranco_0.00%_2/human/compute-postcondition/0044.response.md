To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

- The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.
- The current state is:
  - `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v - 1`.
  - `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
  - `curr_v` is increased by 1.
  - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` must still hold true after the adjustments. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k` at the end of each iteration, the next value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` will be `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_i` (which is `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k`) must be less than `len(permutation)`.

State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v - 1`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `curr_v` is increased by 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is increased by `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_i + k` must be less than `len(permutation)`**
