The value of `t` is decremented by 1. Since `t` was already `t - 1` and was stated to be greater than 0, after decrementing, `t` is now `t - 2` and is still greater than 0. The other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` is now `t - 2` (which is still greater than 0), and `func_1()` has been called twice.**
