Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` with `permutation[0]` set to 1 and `permutation[k]` set to 2, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 3, `i` is 0, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is `k`.** 

Explanation: The value of `curr_v` is incremented by 1, changing from 2 to 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
