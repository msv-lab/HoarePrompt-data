To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the condition in the `while` loop:

```python
while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Condition:**
   - The variables in the loop condition are `multiples_of_k_plus_i` and `len(permutation)`.

2. **Initial State:**
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2.
   - `len(permutation)` is `n`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.
   - Given the initial state, this translates to: `2 < n`.

4. **Check Initial State:**
   - From the problem statement, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
   - Since `n` is at least 2, the condition `2 < n` is already satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Since the condition `2 < n` is already satisfied given the constraints, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `permutation[1]` is `curr_v`, `permutation[1 + k]` is `curr_v + 1`, `permutation[1 + 2 * k]` is `curr_v + 2`, ..., `permutation[n - 1]` is the final value of `curr_v`, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `n`, `i` is 2, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 2**
