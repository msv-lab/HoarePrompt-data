Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. After the function completes, `t` is reduced to `0`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The function effectively repeats the execution of `func_1` based on the user-provided integer. **
