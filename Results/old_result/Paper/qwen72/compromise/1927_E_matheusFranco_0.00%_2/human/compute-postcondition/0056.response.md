The function `func_1` does not explicitly list any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both are integers, and they satisfy the conditions 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is even. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value without additional context. However, given the constraints, we can infer that the function likely performs some operation involving these parameters and returns a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers, where 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The function returns a result based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.**
