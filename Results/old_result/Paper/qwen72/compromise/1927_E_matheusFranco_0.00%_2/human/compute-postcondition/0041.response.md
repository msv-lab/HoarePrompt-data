Output State: **`permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i]` is set to `curr_v`, `n` is an integer such that `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `curr_v` to the element in the `permutation` list at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_i`. The initial condition that `n` is an integer within the range `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` remains unchanged.
