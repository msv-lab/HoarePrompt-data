To determine if the loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `n` and `k` are integers such that \(2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(k\) is even.
- `permutation` is a list of length `n`.
- `idx` is 0.
- `idx_v` is 1.
- `curr_v` is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus one.
- `i` is 1.
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1.

### Condition Analysis:
The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)`. For the loop to execute at least once, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` must be less than `len(permutation)`.

Given:
- `len(permutation) = n`
- `multiples_of_k_plus_i = 1`

For the loop to execute:
\[ 1 < n \]

Since `n` is given to be an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), it is always true that \(1 < n\).

### Conclusion:
No adjustments are needed because the condition `multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation)` is already satisfied with the given initial state.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where `permutation[i * k]` is set to `i + 1` for all valid `i` (i.e., `i * k < n`), `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is the number of multiples of `k` that fit into `n` plus one, `i` is 1, `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is 1**
