Since the function `func_1()` is called without any parameters and there is no information about what `func_1()` does or any variables it might modify, we cannot determine the exact changes it makes to the program state. However, we know that `t` must be greater than 0 before the function call.

Output State: **No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, `t` must be greater than 0, and `func_1()` has been called.**
