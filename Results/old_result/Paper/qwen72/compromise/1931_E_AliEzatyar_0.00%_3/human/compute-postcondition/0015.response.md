Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5; `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`, and `i` is the index of the first non-zero element from the end of the list, or -1 if all elements are zero.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `num` remains unchanged.
- The variable `counter` will hold the count of consecutive zeros from the end of the list `num`.
- The variable `i` will be the index of the first non-zero element when iterating from the end of the list. If the list `num` consists entirely of zeros, `i` will be -1.
