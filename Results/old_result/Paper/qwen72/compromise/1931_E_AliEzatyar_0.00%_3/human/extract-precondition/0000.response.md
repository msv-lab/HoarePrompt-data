Precondition: **num is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of num is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take two parameters: the list of integers and the integer m, which determines the winning condition. A correct function definition would be:

```
def func_1(numbers, m):
```

Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of numbers is in the range 1 to 2 * 10^5. m is a non-negative integer in the range 0 to 2 * 10^6.**
