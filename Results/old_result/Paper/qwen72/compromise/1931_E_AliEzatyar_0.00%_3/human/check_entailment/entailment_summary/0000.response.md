Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `m`, and the list of integers.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros**: The program calculates the total number of digits in the list and counts the trailing zeros for each number using the `func_1` function. The `func_1` function works as intended, counting the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy**: The program attempts to determine the winner based on the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros. However, the logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the number of trailing zeros can be subtracted from the total number of digits to determine if the final number will be greater than or equal to \(10^m\). This is not a valid strategy for the game described.

4. **Winning Condition**: The winning condition for Sasha is that the final number should be greater than or equal to \(10^m\). The program's logic for this condition is incorrect. It should consider the maximum possible number that can be formed after all moves, not just the total number of digits minus some trailing zeros.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the results for each test case, but it incorrectly prints "Sashah" instead of "Sasha" due to a typo.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game and has a typo in the output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
