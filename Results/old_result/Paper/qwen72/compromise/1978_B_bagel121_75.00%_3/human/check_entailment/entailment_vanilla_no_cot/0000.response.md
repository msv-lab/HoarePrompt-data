Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Condition Check**: For each test case, it checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If so, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`, and the profit is simply `n * a`.
3. **Optimal k Calculation**: If `a < b`, it calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n` to ensure that the modified prices are used effectively.
4. **Profit Calculation**:
   - It calculates the profit from the first `k` buns sold at modified prices using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\text{sum} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\).
   - It calculates the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.
5. **Output**: The total profit is printed for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
