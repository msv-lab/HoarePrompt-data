Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` is attempting to count the number of times the balance (sum of +1 for '+' and -1 for '-') goes below zero, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty as defined in the problem statement.

The problem requires splitting the array into subarrays such that the total penalty, defined as the sum of the penalties of each subarray, is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The correct approach involves recognizing that the minimum penalty can be achieved by splitting the array at every transition from '+' to '-' or vice versa, ensuring that each subarray is balanced (sum of elements is zero) or as close to balanced as possible. If the entire array is balanced (sum is zero), the minimum penalty is zero. If not, the penalty is the absolute value of the sum of the entire array multiplied by its length, but this can be optimized by splitting the array into the smallest possible balanced subarrays.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it counts the number of times the balance goes below zero and adds one if the final balance is positive, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

A correct solution would involve calculating the sum of the entire array and then determining the minimum penalty based on the sum and the length of the array, ensuring that the array is split optimally to minimize the penalty.
