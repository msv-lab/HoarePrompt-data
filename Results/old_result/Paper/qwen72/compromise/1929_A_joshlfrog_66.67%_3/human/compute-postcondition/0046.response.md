Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, and `x` is the maximum of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` if any of these values are greater than 0. If `nums[2]` is less than `y`, then `y` is updated to `nums[2]`. Otherwise, `y` remains 100000000 if `nums[0]` was less than 100000000, or `y` remains `nums[0]` if `nums[0]` was greater than or equal to 100000000.***
