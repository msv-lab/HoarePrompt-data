Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `e` is 2, `l` is the new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the maximum value in the new list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the new list `nums`.** 

The code snippet `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` updates the `nums` list to a new list of integers provided by the user. The values of `x` and `y` are then recalculated based on the new `nums` list. The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
