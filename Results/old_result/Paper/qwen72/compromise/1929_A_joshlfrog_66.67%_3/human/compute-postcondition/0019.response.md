Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `e` is 0, `l` is greater than 2, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `x` is equal to `nums[2]`.** 

The value of `x` is updated to be equal to the third element in the list `nums` (since `i` is 2, `nums[i]` refers to `nums[2]`). The values of `t`, `e`, `l`, `nums`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `y` is not affected by this code snippet.
