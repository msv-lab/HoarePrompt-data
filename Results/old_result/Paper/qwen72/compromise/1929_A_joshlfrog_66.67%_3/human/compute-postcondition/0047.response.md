Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `e` is 1, `l` is the new input integer, `i` is `l-1`, `nums` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is the maximum value in the list `nums`, `y` is the minimum value in the list `nums`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 1, and `e` remains 1, as these are not affected by the loop.
- The variable `l` remains the same as the input integer, which is the length of the list `nums`.
- The variable `i` is `l-1` after the loop completes, because the loop iterates from 0 to `l-1`.
- The list `nums` remains unchanged, as the loop does not modify it.
- The variable `x` is updated to the maximum value found in the list `nums`. This is because the loop checks each element of `nums` and updates `x` if the current element is greater than the current value of `x`.
- The variable `y` is updated to the minimum value found in the list `nums`. This is because the loop checks each element of `nums` and updates `y` if the current element is less than the current value of `y`. Initially, `y` is set to a very large number (100000000), so it will be updated to the smallest value in the list.
