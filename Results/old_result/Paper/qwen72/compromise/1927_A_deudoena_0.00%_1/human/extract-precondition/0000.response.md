Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def min_paint_length(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` as described in the precondition.
