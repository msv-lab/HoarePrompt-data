Postcondition: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and `sequence` is a list of integers of length at most 200, with elements in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. No changes have been made to the variables. The current value of `number` is 0.**

Note: The precondition states that `number` is an integer within a specific range, but the if condition checks if `number` is 0. Since the if condition is entered, it implies that `number` must be 0, which contradicts the precondition. However, for the purpose of this task, we include both the precondition and the if condition in the postcondition.
