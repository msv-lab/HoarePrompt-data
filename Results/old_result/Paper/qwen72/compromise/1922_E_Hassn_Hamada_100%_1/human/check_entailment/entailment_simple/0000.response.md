### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The task is to generate an array of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are strictly increasing and appear in the same order as in the array.
   - The array elements should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with \( n - 1 \) and an initially empty list `result`.
   - After `func_1` returns, it prints the length of `result` and the elements of `result`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers that forms the required array.
   - It uses a loop to find the largest integer `size` such that \((1 << size) - (1 << i) \leq number\).
   - It then appends integers to the `sequence` list and recursively calls itself with the remaining number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Base Case:** The function returns `(0, 0)` when `number` is 0. This is correct because an array with 0 increasing subsequences can be represented by an empty array.
   - **Loop and Calculation:**
     - The loop iterates over the range from the maximum value in `sequence` down to 0.
     - It calculates the value \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\) and checks if it is less than or equal to `number`.
     - If it is, it updates `size_overlap` and breaks out of the loop.
   - **Appending to Sequence:**
     - The function appends integers from `overlap` to `size - 1` to the `sequence`.
     - This ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing.
   - **Recursive Call:**
     - The function recursively calls itself with the remaining number of increasing subsequences, which is calculated as `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Range of Sequence Elements:** The elements appended to `sequence` are in the range \([0, 199]\), which is within the allowed range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).
   - **Length of Sequence:** The sequence length is at most 200, as the function appends at most 200 elements.
   - **Correct Calculation of Remaining Subsequences:** The recursive call correctly updates the number of remaining increasing subsequences.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - **X = 2:** The program correctly generates a sequence with exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
   - **X = 5, 13, 37:** The program generates sequences that have the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly generate an array that meets the problem's requirements. The logic for generating the sequence and the recursive calls are sound, and the constraints are respected.

### Correctness:
**True**
