Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where `X = 2`. According to the problem description, for `X = 2`, the output should be an array that has exactly 2 increasing subsequences. However, the program outputs a single-element array `[0]`, which has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the single-element subsequence). This does not meet the requirement of having exactly 2 increasing subsequences.

To further illustrate, the expected output for `X = 2` could be:
```
2
0 1
```
This array has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[0]` and `[0, 1]`.

The program fails to generate the correct output for this specific case, hence it is incorrect.
