### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the winner of a game where Alice and Bob take turns to either swap wallets or remove a coin from their current wallet. The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move, which happens when their wallet is empty and they cannot swap.

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins. Here's why:

1. **Parity of Total Coins:**
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, then the game will always end in a situation where both wallets are empty at the same time, and the player whose turn it is will lose.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, then the game will end with one wallet having one coin left, and the player whose turn it is will be able to remove that coin, forcing the opponent to lose on the next turn.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the first player (Alice) will always lose because she will be the one to face the situation where both wallets are empty.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the first player (Alice) will always win because she can force the game into a state where the second player (Bob) will be the one to face the empty wallet on their turn.

### Program Analysis:

- The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from a string input.
- It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
- If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'.
- If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

This logic is correct based on the reasoning above. The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
