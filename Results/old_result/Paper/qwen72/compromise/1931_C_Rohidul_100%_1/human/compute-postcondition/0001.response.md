Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases, and for each test case, the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal has been printed. The variables `l`, `r`, `st`, `end`, and `ans` are reset and recalculated for each test case, and their final values after the last test case are not relevant to the output state. The loop variable `_` has completed its range, and the input has been fully consumed.**
