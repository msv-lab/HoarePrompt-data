The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the size of an array, followed by a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the array elements. The function computes the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal. The total number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It returns the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal for each test case.**
