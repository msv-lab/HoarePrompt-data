Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads the size of the array and the array itself.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes the length of the array `le`, and two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively. It also initializes `st` and `end` to 1, which will be used to count the lengths of the initial and final segments of the array that are already equal.

3. **Counting Equal Segments**:
   - The first `while` loop moves the left pointer `l` to the right as long as the current element and the next element are the same, incrementing `st` each time.
   - The second `while` loop moves the right pointer `r` to the left as long as the current element and the previous element are the same, incrementing `end` each time.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The initial cost `ans` is calculated as the total length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`. This accounts for the scenario where the longest segment of equal elements is either at the beginning or the end of the array.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of 0 and the total length of the array minus the sum of `st` and `end`. This accounts for the scenario where the array can be made equal by combining the initial and final segments.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

The logic correctly handles the problem constraints and edge cases, ensuring that the minimum cost to make all elements equal is calculated accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
