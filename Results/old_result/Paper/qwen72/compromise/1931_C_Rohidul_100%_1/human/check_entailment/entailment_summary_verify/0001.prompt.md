You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        le = len(a)
        (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
        (st, end) = (1, 1)
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of operations (burles) required to make all elements of the array equal. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case directly. After processing all test cases, the function has consumed all input and printed the results, leaving no relevant state in the variables used for computation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.

2. **Initial Setup**: The program initializes the variables `l` and `r` to point to the start and end of the array, respectively. It also initializes `st` and `end` to 1, which will be used to count the lengths of the initial and final segments of the array where all elements are the same.

3. **Finding Initial and Final Segments**:
   - The first `while` loop increments `l` and `st` as long as the current element `a[l]` is equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`. This loop finds the length of the initial segment of the array where all elements are the same.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `r` and increments `end` as long as the current element `a[r]` is equal to the previous element `a[r - 1]`. This loop finds the length of the final segment of the array where all elements are the same.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The initial cost `ans` is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`, where `le` is the length of the array. This means the cost is the length of the array minus the length of the longer segment (initial or final).
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the program updates `ans` to `max(0, le - (st + end))`. This means the cost is the length of the array minus the sum of the lengths of both segments, but it ensures the cost is not negative.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The program aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by selecting a segment and assigning a value to it.
- The logic of finding the initial and final segments where all elements are the same is correct. This helps in determining the minimum cost by either:
  - Assigning the value of the initial segment to the entire array.
  - Assigning the value of the final segment to the entire array.
  - If the initial and final segments have the same value, it considers the combined length of both segments.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array**: The program correctly handles this case by printing 0, as no operation is needed.
- **Already Equal Array**: The program correctly handles this case by printing 0, as no operation is needed.
- **Array with Different Elements**: The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering the longer segment.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It follows the logic of finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by considering the initial and final segments.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
