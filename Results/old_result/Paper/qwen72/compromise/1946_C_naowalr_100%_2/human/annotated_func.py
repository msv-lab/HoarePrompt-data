#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant as the function `func_1` does not take any parameters. The function is designed to read input data from `sys.stdin` and call the `solve` function for each set of input data.
def func_1():
    for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):
        solve()
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the `solve` function has been called for each set of input data read from `sys.stdin`. The number of times the `solve` function was called is equal to the integer value read from the first line of `sys.stdin`. The initial state of the variables outside the loop remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer from `sys.stdin`, which specifies the number of times the `solve` function will be called. For each iteration, it reads a set of input data (the specifics of which are not provided) and calls the `solve` function with that data. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `solve` function has been called the number of times specified by the integer read from `sys.stdin`, and the initial state of any variables outside the function remains unchanged.
