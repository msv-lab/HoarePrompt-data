Correctness: **False**

The provided program has some logical issues that need to be addressed to correctly determine the winner of the game. Here are the issues:

1. **Initial Condition Handling**:
   - The condition `if a == b:` is correct. If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will always win because Alice will be forced to make the first move, and Bob can mirror her moves.

2. **Single Coin Cases**:
   - The condition `if a == 1:` is incorrect. If Alice has 1 coin and Bob has more than 1 coin, Alice will lose because she will be forced to remove her coin and then Bob will have a non-empty wallet.
   - The condition `if b == 1:` is also incorrect. If Bob has 1 coin and Alice has more than 1 coin, Bob will lose because Alice can force Bob to remove his coin and then Alice will have a non-empty wallet.

3. **Parity Check**:
   - The conditions `if a % 2 == 1:` and `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 1:` are not sufficient to determine the winner. The game's outcome depends on the number of moves each player can make, not just the parity of the coin counts.

4. **General Case**:
   - The conditions `if a > b:` and `else:` are not correct. The game's outcome should be determined by the number of moves each player can make, which is influenced by the initial coin counts.

To correctly determine the winner, we need to consider the number of moves each player can make. The player with the larger number of coins will always win if the difference in the number of coins is more than 1. If the difference is 1, the player with the even number of coins will win. If both players have the same number of coins, Bob will win.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for i in range(T):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            print('Bob')
        elif (a - 1) % 2 == 0 and (b - 1) % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        elif (a - 1) % 2 == 1 and (b - 1) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        elif a > b:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

Explanation:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins because Alice will be forced to make the first move and Bob can mirror her moves.
- If `(a - 1) % 2 == 0` and `(b - 1) % 2 == 1`, Alice wins because she can force Bob into a losing position.
- If `(a - 1) % 2 == 1` and `(b - 1) % 2 == 0`, Bob wins because he can force Alice into a losing position.
- If `a > b`, Bob wins because he can always force Alice into a position where she has fewer coins.
- Otherwise, Alice wins.

This corrected program should accurately determine the winner based on the given problem description.
