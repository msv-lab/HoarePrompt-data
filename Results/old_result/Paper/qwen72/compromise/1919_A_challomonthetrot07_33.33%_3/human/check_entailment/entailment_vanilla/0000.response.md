### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.

2. **Winning Conditions:**
   - **If `a == b`:** Bob wins because they will always end up with the same number of coins, and the game will end when both have 0 coins. Since Alice goes first, she will be the one who cannot make a move when both wallets are empty.
   - **If `a == 1`:** Alice wins because she can always swap with Bob and then remove a coin from Bob's wallet, leaving Bob with 0 coins on his turn.
   - **If `b == 1`:** Bob wins because Alice will be forced to swap with Bob, and then Bob can remove a coin from Alice's wallet, leaving Alice with 0 coins on her next turn.
   - **If `a % 2 == 1`:** Bob wins because if Alice has an odd number of coins, she will always be the one to make the last move when both wallets have 0 coins. This is because the number of moves required to reduce an odd number to 0 is odd, and since Alice goes first, Bob will make the final move.
   - **If `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 1`:** Alice wins because if Alice has an even number of coins and Bob has an odd number of coins, Alice can always force Bob to make the last move when both wallets have 0 coins. This is because the number of moves required to reduce an even number to 0 is even, and the number of moves required to reduce an odd number to 0 is odd. Alice can always swap to ensure Bob is the one to make the last move.
   - **If `a > b`:** Bob wins because if Alice has more coins than Bob, Bob can always force Alice to make the last move when both wallets have 0 coins. This is because Bob can always swap to ensure Alice has more coins, and Alice will be the one to make the last move.
   - **Otherwise:** Alice wins because if Bob has more coins than Alice, Alice can always force Bob to make the last move when both wallets have 0 coins. This is because Alice can always swap to ensure Bob has more coins, and Bob will be the one to make the last move.

3. **Logical Flow:**
   - The conditions are checked in a specific order to ensure that the correct winner is determined for each test case.
   - The conditions cover all possible scenarios based on the parity of `a` and `b` and their relative values.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles all the given conditions and test cases.
- The logic is sound and follows the rules of the game as described.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
