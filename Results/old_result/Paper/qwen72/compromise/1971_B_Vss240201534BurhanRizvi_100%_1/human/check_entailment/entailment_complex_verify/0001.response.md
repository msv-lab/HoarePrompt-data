### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` using `input()`.
   - This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - The program checks if the length of the string `s` is 1 using `if len(s) == 1`.
   - If true, it prints 'No' because it's impossible to rearrange a single character string to form a different string.
   - This is correct as per the problem statement.

3. **All Characters are the Same:**
   - The program checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same using `elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1`.
   - If true, it prints 'No' because any rearrangement of a string with all identical characters will result in the same string.
   - This is also correct as per the problem statement.

4. **General Case:**
   - The program attempts to rearrange the string `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))` to create a new string `s2`.
   - It checks if `s2` is equal to `s` using `if s == s2`.
   - If they are equal, it manually rearranges `s2` by moving the first character to the end (`s2 = s[1:] + s[0]`).
   - This ensures that `s2` is different from `s` in the general case where `s` has at least two different characters.
   - The use of `random.sample` is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string. However, the check `if s == s2` and the manual rearrangement `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` ensures that the generated string is different from the original string `s`. This is a robust solution because:
     - If the random permutation is different, it is used directly.
     - If the random permutation is the same, the manual rearrangement guarantees a different string.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'Yes' followed by the rearranged string `s2`.
   - The output format is correct as per the problem statement.

### Analysis:
- **Single Character String:** Correctly handled by printing 'No'.
- **All Characters are the Same:** Correctly handled by printing 'No'.
- **General Case:** The use of `random.sample` is a valid approach to generate a random permutation of the string. The check `if s == s2` and the manual rearrangement `s2 = s[1:] + s[0]` ensures that the generated string is different from the original string `s`. This is a robust solution because it covers the edge case where the random permutation might be the same as the original string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the output string is different from the input string when possible and reports 'No' when it is not possible.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
