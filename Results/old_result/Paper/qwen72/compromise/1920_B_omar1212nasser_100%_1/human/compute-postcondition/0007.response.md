The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers, and `elements` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000. The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which contains the initial value of `s` and the value of `s` minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements of `elements` after each iteration of the loop.
