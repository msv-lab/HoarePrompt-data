The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes. The variables `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are reinitialized for each test case based on the input provided.
