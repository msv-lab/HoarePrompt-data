Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n`, `k`, and `x`, followed by the array `a`.

2. **Sorting**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which minimizes the impact on the sum) and Bob to flip the largest negative elements (which maximizes the reduction in the sum).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played their moves.
   - `s` is initialized as the sum of all elements in the array.
   - `s2` is initialized as the sum of the last `x` elements in the sorted array (which are the largest elements).
   - The list `pos` is used to store the possible sums after different numbers of removals by Alice.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `k` (inclusive), simulating the removal of the smallest `i` elements by Alice.
   - For each removal, the sum `s` is updated by subtracting the smallest element that was removed.
   - The sum `s2` is updated to reflect the sum of the largest `x` elements after the removals.
   - The new sum after Bob's flips is calculated as `s - 2 * s2` and appended to `pos`.
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob should flip the largest elements to minimize the sum.
   - The program correctly considers all possible scenarios where Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob flips up to `x` elements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` or `x` is 0.
   - The program also handles the case where the array has fewer elements than `k` or `x`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the optimal sum for each test case, which is the maximum value from the list `pos`.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
