### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice can remove up to `k` elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob can multiply up to `x` elements by -1 to minimize the sum.
   - The goal is to find the sum of the array after both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` to facilitate the optimal removal and negation.
   - It calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted array `a`.
   - The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the optimal sum after Alice's removals and Bob's negations.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array and the sum `s2` of the last `x` elements (which Bob will negate).
   - It then iterates over the possible number of removals from 0 to `k`:
     - For each removal, it updates the sum `s` by subtracting the last element of the array.
     - It updates `s2` to reflect the sum of the last `x` elements after the removal.
     - If the total number of negations plus the number of removals is less than or equal to the length of the array, it adds the next element to `s2`.
     - It appends the new potential sum to the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

4. **Optimality:**
   - Alice will remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum.
   - Bob will negate the largest elements to minimize the sum.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calculates the potential sums for each combination of removals and negations, and returns the maximum possible sum.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `k` or `x` is 0.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of removals plus the number of negations exceeds the length of the array.

6. **Input and Output:**
   - The input format is correctly followed.
   - The output format matches the problem description.
