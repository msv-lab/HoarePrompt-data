The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` from the input. Depending on the values of `A`, `B`, and `C`, it prints either `A * B`, `A * C / 2` (if `A` is even), or two lines: `X` and `X * C + B` (if `A` is odd, where `X` is `A // 2`). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. The values of `t`, `A`, `B`, and `C` are not modified and remain as they were read from the input.
