Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect logic for odd number of yogurts**: When `A` (the number of yogurts) is odd, the program calculates the cost for `X` yogurts (where `X = A // 2`) and then adds the cost of one additional yogurt. However, it prints `X` and `X * C + B` separately, which is incorrect. It should print the total cost in one line.

2. **Incorrect logic for even number of yogurts**: When `A` is even, the program calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`. This is correct, but it should be consistent with the logic for odd numbers to avoid confusion.

3. **Handling the case where the promotion is not beneficial**: The condition `if B * 2 < C` correctly identifies when buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion. However, the program should handle this condition for both even and odd numbers of yogurts.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            total_cost = X * C
            if A % 2 == 1:
                total_cost += B
            print(total_cost)
```

This version correctly calculates the minimum cost for both even and odd numbers of yogurts, and it handles the case where the promotion is not beneficial.
