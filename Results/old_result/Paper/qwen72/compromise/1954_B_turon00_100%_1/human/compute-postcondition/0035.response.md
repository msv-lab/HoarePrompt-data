Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the new list `a` is different from `tmp`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
