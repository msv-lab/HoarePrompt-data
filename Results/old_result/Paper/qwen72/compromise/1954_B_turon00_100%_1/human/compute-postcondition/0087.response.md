Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- If the last element of the list `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
- Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.
- Additionally, either `n` is equal to 1, or `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a` if `a` has `n` elements.
   - The condition about the last element of `a` and `tmp` affects the value of `cnt` and `ans`.
   - If the last element of `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - If the last element of `a` does not equal `tmp`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.
   - Either `n` is 1, or `ans` is equal to `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(-1)` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
   - It simply prints the integer `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(-1)` statement will always print `-1`, regardless of the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`, `cnt`, or `ans`.

Output: **-1**
