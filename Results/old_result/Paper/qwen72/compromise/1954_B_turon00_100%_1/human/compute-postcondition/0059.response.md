Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
   - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`.
   - `i` is `n-1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
   - `n` is not equal to 1.
   - `ans` is not equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.
   - `i` is the index of the last element in the list `a`, which is `n-1`.
   - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is updated to be the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.

4. **Determine the Value of `ans`:**
   - Since `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, it can range from 0 to `n-1` (since `n` is the length of the list and `i` is `n-1`).
   - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
   - The initial value of `ans` is not provided, but it is updated to be the minimum of itself and `cnt`.
   - Given that `ans` is not equal to `n`, and `cnt` can be at most `n-1`, `ans` will be a value between 0 and `n-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(ans)` statement will output the value of `ans`, which is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to the first element of the list `a`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the minimum value between the previous ans and the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to the first element of the list `a`, and ans is not equal to n)**
