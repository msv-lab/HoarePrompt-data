Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`. If the last element of the list `a` equals `tmp`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of `a` that are equal to `tmp`. Otherwise, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`, and `cnt` is set to 0.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was initially set.
- The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration.
- The variable `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`. If the last element of `a` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` will be 0.
- The variable `ans` will be the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the iterations where `a[i]` was not equal to `tmp`. If all elements in `a` are equal to `tmp`, `ans` will remain `n`.
