Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the new list that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the new list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the new list `a` is different from `tmp`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `tmp = a[0]` assigns the first element of the list `a` to the variable `tmp`. Since `tmp` was already defined as equal to the first element of the new list `a` in the initial state, this assignment does not change the value of `tmp`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
