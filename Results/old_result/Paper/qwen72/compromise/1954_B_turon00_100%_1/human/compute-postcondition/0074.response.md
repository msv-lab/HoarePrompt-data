The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
