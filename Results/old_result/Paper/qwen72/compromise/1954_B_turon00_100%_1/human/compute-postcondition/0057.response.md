The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(-1)
```

### Analysis:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
  - `n` is greater than 0.
  - `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user.
  - `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`.
  - `i` is `n-1`.
  - `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
  - `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`.
  - Additionally, either `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`.

### Explanation:
- The `print` statement in the code snippet simply prints the integer `-1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be `-1`.

### Final Output:
Output: **-1**
