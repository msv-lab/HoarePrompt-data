The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`
- `i` is `n-1`
- `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0
- `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the list `a` is different from `tmp`
- If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`

After executing the code:
- The variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `tmp`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the new list that are equal to `tmp` if the last element of the new list `a` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value of `cnt` encountered during the loop, or `n` if no element in the new list `a` is different from `tmp`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the current state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
