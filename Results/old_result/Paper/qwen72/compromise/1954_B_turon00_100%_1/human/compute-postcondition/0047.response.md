Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1.**

The variable `cnt` is reset to 0, while all other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `i`, and `ans`) retain their initial values.
