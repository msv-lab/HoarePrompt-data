Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the new list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.**
