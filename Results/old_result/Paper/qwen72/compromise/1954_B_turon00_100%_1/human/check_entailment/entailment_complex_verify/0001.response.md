### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `tmp` is initialized to the first element of the array `a[0]`.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n` to store the minimum number of elements to remove.

3. **Loop Through Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array `a` to count the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp`.
   - If an element `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is incremented.
   - If an element `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, the program updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt`, and resets `cnt` to 0.

4. **Final Update**:
   - After the loop, the program updates `ans` to the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

5. **Output**:
   - If the array length `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array not beautiful.
   - Otherwise, the program prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful.
- The logic of counting consecutive elements and updating `ans` to the minimum count is correct for identifying the smallest segment of consecutive elements.
- However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output `1` because it finds a segment of length 1, but the array is already not beautiful and no elements need to be removed.

### Correctness:

The original assessment is correct. The program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. The program should check if the array is already not beautiful before attempting to find the minimum number of elements to remove. This can be done by checking if there are any elements in the array that are not equal to the first element, and if so, the array is already not beautiful and the answer should be `0`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
