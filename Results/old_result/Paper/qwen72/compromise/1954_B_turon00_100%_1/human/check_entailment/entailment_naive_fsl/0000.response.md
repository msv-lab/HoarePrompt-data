Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array is beautiful and consists of more than one unique element, but the unique elements are not adjacent. For example, consider the input:
```
1
7
1 2 1 3 1 2 1
```
The array is beautiful because we can perform operations to make all elements the same. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `3` because we need to remove at least three elements to prevent the array from being beautiful. Removing any single element will still allow the array to be made beautiful with the remaining elements.
