To determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` remain unchanged.
   - `ans` is a set containing all possible values of `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for all integers `k` from `0` to `m`.
   - `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, then `0` is removed from the set and `n` is added to the set. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Set `ans`:**
   - The set `ans` is populated with values derived from the expressions `(x + k*r) % n` and `(x - k*r) % n` for each integer `k` from `0` to `m`.
   - These expressions are modular arithmetic operations, which means the results will be in the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Modifying the Set `ans`:**
   - After populating `ans`, if `0` is present in the set, it is removed, and `n` is added to the set.
   - This modification ensures that if `0` is a result of any of the modular operations, it is replaced by `n`.

4. **Output of the `print` Statement:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the set `ans` separated by spaces.
   - The elements of `ans` will be the unique results of the modular arithmetic operations, with `0` replaced by `n` if `0` was present.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be the elements of the set `ans` after the described modifications. Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and the results of `func_1()` are not provided, we can describe the output in a general form.

Output: **[elements of ans] (where ans is a set containing all unique values of (x + k*r) % n and (x - k*r) % n for k from 0 to m, with 0 replaced by n if 0 is present)**

This description captures the essence of the set `ans` and the modifications applied to it.
