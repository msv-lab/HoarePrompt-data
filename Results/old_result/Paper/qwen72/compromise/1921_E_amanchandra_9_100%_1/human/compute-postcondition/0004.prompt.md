You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. These integers should satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. The function should also handle the input of the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). The sum of `h` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        r, w, a, b, c, d = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= 
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read six integers from the input, perform the specified conditions, and print either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions. After all iterations, the value of `t` will be unchanged, and the input variables for each test case (`r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) will be consumed and not retained. The output will be a series of strings, each either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', corresponding to the result of each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function handles multiple test cases, each with six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the given parameters, ensuring that the constraints on `t`, `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b` are met.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
