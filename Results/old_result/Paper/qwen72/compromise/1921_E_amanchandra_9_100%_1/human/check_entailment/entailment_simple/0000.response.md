### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads six integers `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` from the input. This matches the problem description.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The function checks if `a > c` (i.e., Alice's chip is initially below Bob's chip). If this is true, the function immediately prints "Draw". This is correct because if Alice's chip is below Bob's chip, Alice cannot move up to Bob's chip, and Bob cannot move down to Alice's chip. Therefore, the game will end in a draw.

3. **Distance Calculation**: If `a <= c`, the function calculates `x` as the integer division of the absolute difference between `a` and `c` by 2. This is a key part of the logic to determine if Alice or Bob can win.

4. **Odd Distance Case**: If the distance `abs(a - c)` is odd, the function calculates the range of possible positions for Alice's chip after `x` moves. It then checks if Alice can move to a position that intersects with Bob's chip. The conditions `abs(l - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - b) <= x + 1` are used to determine if Alice can win. If either condition is true, the function prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

5. **Even Distance Case**: If the distance `abs(a - c)` is even, the function calculates the range of possible positions for Bob's chip after `x` moves. It then checks if Bob can move to a position that intersects with Alice's chip. The conditions `abs(l - d) <= x` and `abs(r - d) <= x` are used to determine if Bob can win. If either condition is true, the function prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".

6. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is either "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob". This matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem's constraints and logic. However, there is a potential issue with the variable names used in the function. The variables `r`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not consistent with the problem description, which uses `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, and `y_b`. This could lead to confusion, but the logic itself is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem. However, it is recommended to use variable names that match the problem description for clarity.
