Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. These integers should satisfy the conditions: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`. The function should also handle the input of the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4). The sum of `h` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.**
