### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading an integer `N` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `N` times, reading an integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - For each `n`, the program iterates from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) and calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of the digits of each integer `i`.
   - The result of `func_1(i)` is added to the variable `soma`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` converts the integer `n` to a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts each character back to an integer, and sums these integers.
   - This correctly calculates the sum of the digits of `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints the total sum `soma`.

5. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the sum of the digits of each number from 1 to `n` is correct.
   - However, the program sums the results of all test cases into a single variable `soma` and prints it at the end, which is incorrect. The problem requires the sum for each test case to be printed separately.

6. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the program is \(O(N \cdot n)\), where \(N\) is the number of test cases and \(n\) is the largest number in each test case.
   - Given the constraints \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), this approach is inefficient and will likely exceed the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not print the sum for each test case separately, and it has a time complexity that is too high to meet the problem's constraints.
