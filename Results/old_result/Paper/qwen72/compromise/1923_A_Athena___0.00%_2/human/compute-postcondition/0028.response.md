Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `res` is 3.**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` was either 1 or 2, depending on whether the first element of `a` was 0 or not. After the increment, `res` is now 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
