The variables in the loop head are `a` and the condition `a[0] == 0`. The loop will execute if `a` is a non-empty list and the first element of `a` is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `a[0]` is no longer 0, which means the loop condition is no longer met. To make the loop execute one more time, `a[0]` must be 0 again.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user and `a[0]` is 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0**
