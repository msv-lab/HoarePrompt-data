The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, this element is removed, and the length of `a` is decreased by 1. The value of `i` is `len(a) - 1`, so `i` is also decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and its last element is removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0.
Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and its last element is removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0.**
