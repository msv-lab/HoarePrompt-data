Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is 1, and `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 1.** 

The value of `res` has been incremented by 1. If the first element of `a` was 0, `res` was initially 1 and is now 2. If the first element of `a` was not 0, `res` was initially 0 and is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
