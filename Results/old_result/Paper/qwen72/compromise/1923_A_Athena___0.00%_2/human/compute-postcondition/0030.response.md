Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will have the value of the last index of the list `a` (which is `len(a) - 1`), and `res` will contain the count of how many zeros are present in the list `a`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, and `n`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
