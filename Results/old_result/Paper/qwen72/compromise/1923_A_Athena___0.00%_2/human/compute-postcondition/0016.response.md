To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `a and a[-1] == 0`.

1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - `a` must be a non-empty list for the condition to be true.
   - `a[-1]` must be equal to 0 for the condition to be true.

2. **Current State**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (irrelevant to the loop condition).
   - `_` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop condition).
   - `n` is an input integer (irrelevant to the loop condition).
   - `a` is a non-empty list with the last element removed.
   - `res` is 0 (irrelevant to the loop condition).

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute again, `a` must still be non-empty after the last element is removed.
   - The last element of `a` must be 0.

Given that `a` is a non-empty list with the last element removed, for the loop to execute one more time, the new last element of `a` must be 0. Since `a` is non-empty, it must have at least one more element, and this element must be 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with the last element removed and the new last element must be 0, `res` is 0**
