The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and at least one trailing zero, removing the last element means that the trailing zero is removed. The length of `a` is now reduced by 1. The variable `i` is `len(a) - 1`, so after the removal, `i` is also reduced by 1. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `res`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and no trailing zeros, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (reduced by the number of leading zeros and one trailing zero, then further reduced by 1), and `res` is 0**.
