### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic for Determining if Another Rectangle Can Be Formed:**
   - The function uses a series of conditions to determine if Bob can form another rectangle from the given `a` and `b`.
   - The first condition checks if both `a` and `b` are even. If they are, the function prints 'yes'. This is correct because if both dimensions are even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle.
   - The second condition checks if `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`. This condition is incorrect and does not make sense. It is checking if the difference between `a` and `b` is equal to a tuple, which is not a valid logical check.
   - The third condition checks if `(a - b) % 2 > 0` or `(a - b) % 2 < 0`. This condition is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1, so the condition will always be true. This means that the function will always print 'yes' for this case, which is not correct.
   - The final `else` block prints 'no'. This is used as a catch-all for cases that do not meet the previous conditions. However, due to the incorrect conditions, this block may not be reached for cases where it should.

3. **Expected Output:**
   - The function should print 'yes' if Bob can form another rectangle and 'no' otherwise.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can form another rectangle.
     - If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

### Correctness:
- The function is **incorrect** because it contains logical errors in the conditions used to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. Specifically, the second and third conditions are invalid and will lead to incorrect outputs.

### Correctness: **False**
