### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions**:
   - **Both dimensions are even**: Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is different from the original. For example, a \(4 \times 6\) rectangle can be cut into two \(4 \times 3\) rectangles, which can be combined to form a \(6 \times 4\) rectangle.
   - **One dimension is 1**: Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting a \(1 \times n\) rectangle will result in two \(1 \times m\) rectangles, which can only form the same \(1 \times n\) rectangle when rotated.
   - **One dimension is even and the other is odd**: Bob can form a new rectangle by cutting the even side. For example, a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, which can be combined to form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle.
   - **Both dimensions are odd**: Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd side will always result in at least one odd side, and the resulting rectangles will be the same as the original when rotated.

3. **Evaluating the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - It reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - The first condition checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. If so, it prints "yes". This is correct.
   - The second condition checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is \(-a\) or \(-b\). This is not a valid condition for the problem. The correct condition should be if either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1, because a \(1 \times n\) rectangle cannot be cut to form a different rectangle.
   - The third condition checks if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd. This is also not a valid condition. The correct condition should be if one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other is odd.
   - The fourth condition is a catch-all for the remaining cases, which should be "no" if the first two conditions are not met.

4. **Correcting the Program**:
   - The second condition should be replaced with a check if either \(a\) or \(b\) is 1.
   - The third condition should be replaced with a check if one of \(a\) or \(b\) is even and the other is odd.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif a == 1 or b == 1:
            print('no')
        elif (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 != 0) or (a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 == 0):
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The original program has logical errors in the second and third conditions.
   - The corrected program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
