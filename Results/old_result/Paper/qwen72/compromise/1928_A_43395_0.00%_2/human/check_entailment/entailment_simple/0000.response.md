Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the given rectangle by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. The key points to consider are:
1. If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle.
2. If one dimension is even and the other is odd, Bob can still form a new rectangle by cutting the even dimension.
3. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd dimension will always result in two smaller rectangles with at least one odd dimension, and combining them will not form a new rectangle.

Let's analyze the given program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

1. **First Condition**: `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`
   - This correctly identifies the case where both dimensions are even. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always form a new rectangle. This condition is correct.

2. **Second Condition**: `elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`
   - This condition is incorrect. The expressions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples, and the condition will always evaluate to `True` because tuples are always truthy in Python. This means that the program will incorrectly print 'no' for many cases where it should print 'yes'.

3. **Third Condition**: `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`
   - This condition is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1 (or -1 if `a < b`). Therefore, `(a - b) % 2 > 0` will be `True` if `a - b` is odd, and `(a - b) % 2 < 0` will never be `True` because the result of the modulo operation is non-negative. This means the condition will only be `True` if `a - b` is odd, which is not the correct logic.

4. **Else Condition**: `else: print('no')`
   - This condition will be reached if the previous conditions are not satisfied. However, due to the incorrect conditions, this will not always be the correct output.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the second and third conditions are flawed and will lead to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**
