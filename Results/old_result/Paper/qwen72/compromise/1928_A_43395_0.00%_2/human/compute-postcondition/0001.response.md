Output State: The function `func` processes all the test cases, each with two integers a and b, and prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The loop iterates over the number of test cases provided as input, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of a rectangle, checks the conditions, and prints the corresponding result. The initial state of the function and the variables outside the loop remain unchanged.
