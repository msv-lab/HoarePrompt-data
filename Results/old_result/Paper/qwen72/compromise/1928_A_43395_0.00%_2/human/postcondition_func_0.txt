The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It prints 'yes' if both dimensions are even, and 'no' for all other cases. The function does not return any values. The variables `a` and `b` are updated for each test case but their final values are not retained after the loop completes.
