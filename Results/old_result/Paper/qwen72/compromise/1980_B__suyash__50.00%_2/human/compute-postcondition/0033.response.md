Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `l` is a list of unique strings, and it must have at least 1 element.
   - `fav` is equal to the first element of the list `l` (i.e., `l[0]`).
   - `k` is updated to `k - dic[l[0]]`, where `dic` is a dictionary and `l[0]` is a key in `dic`.
   - `k` is greater than or equal to 0 after the update.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

Given the initial state, the code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of `i`, `l`, `fav`, and `k` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
