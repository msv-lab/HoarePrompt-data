The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print('YES')
```

Let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It directly prints the string `'YES'`.

Therefore, the output of the code snippet is:
Output: **YES**
