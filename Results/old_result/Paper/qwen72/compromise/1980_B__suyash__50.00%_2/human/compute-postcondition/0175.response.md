Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **`l`**: This is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 3 elements.
2. **`i`**: This is set to 2.
3. **`o`**: This is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string and sorted in descending order.
4. **`b`**: This is a list of integers obtained by splitting a string `a` and converting each part to an integer.
5. **`n`**: This is the first integer in the list `b`.
6. **`f`**: This is the second integer in the list `b`.
7. **`k`**: This is the third integer in the list `b` minus the count of the string at index `f - 1` in `o` minus the count of the string at index 1 in `l` minus the value of `dic[l[2]]`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
