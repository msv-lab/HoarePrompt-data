Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `i` is 0.
   - `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` on whitespace and converting each element to an integer.
   - `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input on whitespace.
   - `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `b`.
   - `f` is equal to the second integer in the list `b`.
   - `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b`.
   - `k` is also equal to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The initial state provides several variables and their relationships, but the code snippet does not use any of these variables.
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string 'YES'.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state, it will always print 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
