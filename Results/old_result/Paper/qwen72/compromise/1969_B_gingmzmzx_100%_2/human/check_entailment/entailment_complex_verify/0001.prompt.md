You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with the last `n` elements, `cnt` is [number of 0s in the final `s`, number of 1s in the final `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in the final `s` plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in the final `s`, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the final `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, indicating the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `n` binary strings, it reads a string `s` from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and calculates a value `ans`. This value `ans` represents the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in the string plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in the string. The function then prints `ans` for each binary string. After processing all `n` strings, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's).
   - We can perform cyclic shifts on any substring, and the cost of each operation is the length of the substring.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted string.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case is a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it converts the binary string into a list of integers (0s and 1s).
   - It counts the number of '0's in the string.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the cost `ans` based on the current character and the counts of '0's and '1's.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each '0' encountered, if there is at least one '1' before it, it adds 1 to the cost.
   - For each '1' encountered, it adds the number of '0's that have not been encountered yet to the cost.
   - This approach ensures that the cost is minimized by only counting the necessary shifts to move '1's to the right of '0's.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted, the cost will be 0.
   - If the string contains only '0's or only '1's, the cost will also be 0.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The program processes each character of the string exactly once, making it O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the string.
   - The total complexity is O(T * n), where T is the number of test cases and n is the length of the string, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all edge cases as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
