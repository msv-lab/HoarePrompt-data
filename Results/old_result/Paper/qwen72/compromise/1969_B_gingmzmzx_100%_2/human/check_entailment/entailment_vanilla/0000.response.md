### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's).
   - We can perform cyclic shifts on any substring, and the cost of each operation is the length of the substring.
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted string.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case is a binary string.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it converts the binary string into a list of integers (0s and 1s).
   - It counts the number of '0's in the string.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It iterates through the string and updates the cost `ans` based on the current character and the counts of '0's and '1's.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each '0' encountered, if there is at least one '1' before it, it adds 1 to the cost.
   - For each '1' encountered, it adds the number of '0's that have not been encountered yet to the cost.
   - This approach ensures that the cost is minimized by only counting the necessary shifts to move '1's to the right of '0's.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted, the cost will be 0.
   - If the string contains only '0's or only '1's, the cost will also be 0.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The program processes each character of the string exactly once, making it O(n) for each test case, where n is the length of the string.
   - The total complexity is O(T * n), where T is the number of test cases and n is the length of the string, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. The logic and implementation are sound and handle all edge cases as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
