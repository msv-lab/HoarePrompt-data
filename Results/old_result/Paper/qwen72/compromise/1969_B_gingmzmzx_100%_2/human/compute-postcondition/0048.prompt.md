Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `cnt` is [0, 0], `ans` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`.
Code of the loop:
for c in s:
    cnt[c] += 1
    if c == 0:
        ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
    else:
        ans += zeroes - cnt[0]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least one integer, `c` is the first integer in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 2 integers, `c` is the second integer in `s`, `cnt` is [1, 1] if the first integer in `s` is 0 and `c` is 1, or [2, 0] if the first integer in `s` is 0 and `c` is 0, or [0, 2] if the first integer in `s` is 1 and `c` is 1, or [1, 1] if the first integer in `s` is 1 and `c` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is 1, `ans` is increased by `zeroes - cnt[0]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 3 integers, `c` is the third integer in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`, `cnt` is updated based on the value of `c` as follows: if `c` is 1, `cnt` is `[1, 2]` or `[0, 3]`; if `c` is 0, `cnt` is `[3, 0]` or `[2, 1]`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is increased by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged. If `c` is 1, `ans` is updated by adding the difference between `zeroes` and `cnt[0]` to its current value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
