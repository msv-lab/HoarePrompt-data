Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `s`, `cnt` is [0, 0] with `cnt[c]` incremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`**

Explanation: The code `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value at the index `c` in the list `cnt` by 1. Since `c` is the first element in `s`, and `s` is a list of integers, `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
