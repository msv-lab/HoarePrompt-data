The function `func_1` should accept a parameter `s`. `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 2 · 10^5, and each character in the string is either '0' or '1'. However, the provided function definition does not include any parameters, which is incorrect. Assuming the correct function definition is `def func_1(s):`, the function's output is not specified in the given information.

Functionality: **The function is expected to accept a binary string `s` with a length between 2 and 2 · 10^5, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The function's output is not specified.**
