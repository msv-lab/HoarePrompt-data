The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1. Since `c` is the second element of `s`, and `s` is a list of integers, `c` can be either 0 or a non-zero integer. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is initially [1, 0], and after the increment, `cnt` becomes [2, 0]. If `c` is a non-zero integer, `cnt` is initially [0, 1], and after the increment, `cnt` becomes [0, 2]. The values of `n`, `s`, `c`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least two elements, `c` is the second element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0] and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 2] and `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.**
