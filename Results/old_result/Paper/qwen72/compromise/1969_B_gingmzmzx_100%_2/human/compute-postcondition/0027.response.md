The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` updates the list `s` by reading a new input string, stripping any leading or trailing whitespace, and converting each character of the stripped string to an integer to form a new list `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with `n` elements
- `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`]
- `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` for each 0 in `s` plus the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for each 1 in `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0.

After executing the code snippet:
- `s` is now a list of integers derived from the new input string, which may have a different number of elements and different values.
- The value of `n` is still greater than 1, but the new list `s` may have a different number of elements.
- `cnt` and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet, so they retain their previous values.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `cnt` is [number of 0s in the previous `s`, number of 1s in the previous `s`], and `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in the previous `s` for each 0 in the previous `s` plus the sum of the number of 0s in the previous `s` for each 1 in the previous `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0.**
