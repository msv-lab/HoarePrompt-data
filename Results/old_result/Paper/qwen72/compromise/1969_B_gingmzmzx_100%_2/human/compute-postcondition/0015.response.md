Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with at least two elements, `c` is the second element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0] and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt` is [0, 2] and `ans` is `zeroes - 1 + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.
- If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [2, 0], and `ans` is 0. Since `cnt[1]` is 0, `ans` remains 0.
- If `c` is not 0, `cnt` is [0, 2], and `ans` is `zeroes - 1`. Since `cnt[1]` is 2, `ans` is incremented by 1, making it `zeroes - 1 + 1`.
