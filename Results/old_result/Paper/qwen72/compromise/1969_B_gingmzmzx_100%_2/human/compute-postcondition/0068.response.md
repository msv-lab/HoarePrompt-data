Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 3 elements, `c` is the third element in `s`, `cnt` is updated to [1, 2] if the first element was 0 and `c` is 1, or [2, 0] if the first element was 0 and `c` is 0, or [0, 3] if the first element was 1 and `c` is 1, or [2, 1] if the first element was 1 and `c` is 0, `ans` is 0 if the first element was 0 or `zeroes - cnt[0]` if the first element was 1, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s` which is at least 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1.
- If the first element of `s` is 0 and `c` is 1, `cnt` was initially [1, 1], and after the increment, it becomes [1, 2].
- If the first element of `s` is 0 and `c` is 0, `cnt` was initially [1, 0], and after the increment, it becomes [2, 0].
- If the first element of `s` is 1 and `c` is 1, `cnt` was initially [0, 2], and after the increment, it becomes [0, 3].
- If the first element of `s` is 1 and `c` is 0, `cnt` was initially [1, 1], and after the increment, it becomes [2, 1].
- The values of `n`, `s`, `c`, `ans`, and `zeroes` remain unchanged, except for the update to `cnt`.
