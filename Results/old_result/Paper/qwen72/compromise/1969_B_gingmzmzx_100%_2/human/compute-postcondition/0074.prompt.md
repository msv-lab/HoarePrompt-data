Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func_1` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}). `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with `n` elements, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], and `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` for each 0 in `s` plus the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for each 1 in `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` multiplied by the number of 0s in `s` before each 1, plus the number of 0s in `s` that come after at least one 1, `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string, `cnt` is [number of 0s in `s`, number of 1s in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in `s` plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in `s`, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the current `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
