To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the calculation of `ans` step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is greater than 0.
2. `s` is a list of integers derived from an input string with `n` elements.
3. `cnt` is a list where:
   - `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s`.
   - `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.
4. `ans` is calculated as the sum of the number of 1s in `s` for each 0 in `s` plus the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for each 1 in `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0.

### Step-by-Step Calculation of `ans`:
1. **Count the number of 0s and 1s in `s`:**
   - `cnt[0]` is the number of 0s in `s`.
   - `cnt[1]` is the number of 1s in `s`.

2. **Sum of the number of 1s for each 0 in `s`:**
   - For each 0 in `s`, the contribution to `ans` is `cnt[1]` (the number of 1s in `s`).

3. **Sum of the number of 0s for each 1 in `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0:**
   - Identify the index of the first 0 in `s`.
   - For each 1 in `s` that appears after the first 0, the contribution to `ans` is `cnt[0]` (the number of 0s in `s`).

### Example Calculation:
Let's consider an example to illustrate the calculation:
- Suppose `s = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
  - `cnt[0] = 2` (number of 0s).
  - `cnt[1] = 4` (number of 1s).

1. **Sum of the number of 1s for each 0 in `s`:**
   - There are 2 zeros in `s`.
   - Each 0 contributes `cnt[1]` to `ans`.
   - Total contribution from 0s: `2 * 4 = 8`.

2. **Sum of the number of 0s for each 1 in `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0:**
   - The first 0 is at index 2.
   - The 1s after the first 0 are at indices 3, 5.
   - Each of these 1s contributes `cnt[0]` to `ans`.
   - Total contribution from 1s after the first 0: `2 * 2 = 4`.

3. **Total `ans`:**
   - `ans = 8 + 4 = 12`.

### General Formula:
- For each 0 in `s`, the contribution to `ans` is `cnt[1]`.
- For each 1 in `s` that appears after the first 0, the contribution to `ans` is `cnt[0]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans` calculated as described above. Since the exact values of `s` are not provided, we can describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of 1s in `s` for each 0 in `s` plus the sum of the number of 0s in `s` for each 1 in `s` except for the 1s that appear before the first 0)**
