Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least one element, `c` is the first element of `s`, `zeroes` is the number of times 0 appears in `s`, `cnt` is a list with values [0, 0] where `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`, and `c` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to the value of `zeroes - cnt[0]`.
- `cnt[0]` remains 0 because `c` is not equal to 0, so `cnt[c]` is incremented by 1 at a different index.
- All other variables (`n`, `s`, `c`, `zeroes`, `cnt`) retain their initial values or conditions.
