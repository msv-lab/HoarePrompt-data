#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(s):` where `s` is a binary string (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5; s_i ∈ {0, 1}).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string with the last `n` elements, `cnt` is [number of 0s in the final `s`, number of 1s in the final `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in the final `s` plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in the final `s`, and `zeroes` is the number of 0s in the final `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the input, indicating the number of binary strings to process. For each of the `n` binary strings, it reads a string `s` from the input, converts it into a list of integers, and calculates a value `ans`. This value `ans` represents the sum of the number of 1s that appear after each 0 in the string plus the number of 0s that appear after each 1 in the string. The function then prints `ans` for each binary string. After processing all `n` strings, the function concludes.
