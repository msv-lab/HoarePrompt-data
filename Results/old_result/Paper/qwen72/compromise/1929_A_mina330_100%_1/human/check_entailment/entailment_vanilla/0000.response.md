Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last element. The beauty is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
   \]
   To maximize this, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Rearranging the Array**: The key insight is that to maximize the sum of differences, we should sort the array in ascending order. This is because the largest differences will be between the smallest and largest elements, and sorting ensures that the differences are maximized in a systematic way.

3. **Calculating the Beauty**: After sorting the array, the maximum beauty can be achieved by taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This is because the sum of differences in a sorted array will be:
   \[
   (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) = a_n - a_1
   \]
   This is the maximum possible beauty because the largest element minus the smallest element will always be the largest possible difference.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `ntest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It prints the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted array, which is `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`.

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the array `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. The maximum beauty is `3 - 1 = 2`.
   - For the array `[69, 69, 69]`, sorting gives `[69, 69, 69]`. The maximum beauty is `69 - 69 = 0`.
   - For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The maximum beauty is `100 - 43 = 57`.
   - For the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The maximum beauty is `4 - 3 = 1`.
   - For the array `[2, 1]`, sorting gives `[1, 2]`. The maximum beauty is `2 - 1 = 1`.

The program correctly implements the logic to sort the array and calculate the maximum beauty as the difference between the largest and smallest elements.
