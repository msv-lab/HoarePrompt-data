Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations, and the variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` have been modified as follows: `ntest` remains unchanged, `itest` is equal to `ntest`, `n` is the last input integer read, and `a` is the last sorted list of integers read. The function has printed the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each array for each test case.**
