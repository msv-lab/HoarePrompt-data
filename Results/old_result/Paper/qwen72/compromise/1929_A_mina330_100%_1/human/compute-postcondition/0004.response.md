Functionality: ** The function `func` reads from standard input a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the length of an array, then reads `n` integers into a list `a`. It sorts the list `a` and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the difference for each test case, and the variables `ntest`, `itest`, `n`, and `a` are in the final state described in the comments. The function does not return any value. **
