The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list represents an array of integers of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with elements in the range 1 to 10^9. The function processes these test cases and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `a`, a list of lists where each inner list is an array of integers. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case.**
