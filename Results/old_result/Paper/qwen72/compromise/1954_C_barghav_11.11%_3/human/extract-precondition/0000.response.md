Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters, x and y, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def maximize_product(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `x` and `y`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of t tuples, each containing two integers x and y where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y have the same length and consist only of digits from 1 to 9.**
