Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads two lines of input, each representing a string of digits (assumed to be integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9 and of the same length). The function then modifies these strings by swapping the minimum and maximum digits between corresponding positions in the first half and second half of the strings, respectively. After processing, it prints the modified first string, followed by the modified second string, and then an empty line. The original input values are not retained or returned. **
