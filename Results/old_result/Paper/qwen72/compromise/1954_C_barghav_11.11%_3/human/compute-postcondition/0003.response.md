Output State: The first half of the list `a` will contain the maximum digit between the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`, while the second half of `a` will contain the minimum digit. Conversely, the first half of the list `b` will contain the minimum digit, and the second half will contain the maximum digit. The length of `a` and `b` remains the same, and the values of `x` and `y` are unchanged. The number of test cases `t` is also unchanged.
