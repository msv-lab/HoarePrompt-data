Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly maximize the product of \(x\) and \(y\) for every potential case. Specifically, the logic in the function `func_1` only swaps the digits once when it finds the first pair of digits where \(a[i] < b[i]\). This approach does not guarantee that the product of \(x\) and \(y\) is maximized.

For example, consider the input:
```
x = 3516
y = 3982
```
The expected output should be:
```
3912
3586
```
However, the program will output:
```
3586
3912
```
This is because the program only swaps the digits at the first position where \(a[i] < b[i]\), which is at index 1 (3 and 9). After this swap, the program does not consider further swaps that could potentially maximize the product.

To correctly maximize the product, the program should consider all possible swaps that can increase the product, not just the first one.
