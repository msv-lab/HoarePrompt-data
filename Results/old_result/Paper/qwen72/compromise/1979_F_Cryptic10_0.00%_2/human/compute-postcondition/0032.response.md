Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must contain at least one element, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**. 

The values of `v` and `u` are now determined by the output of `func_1(d)`, while the other variables remain unchanged.
