Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices` and `v` is appended to `path`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is 0, or if `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration.**

In natural language: The values of `n`, `d`, `v`, `u`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the loop body and move to the next iteration of the loop.
