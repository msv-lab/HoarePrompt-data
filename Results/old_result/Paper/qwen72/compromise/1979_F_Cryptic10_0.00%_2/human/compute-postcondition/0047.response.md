Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` contains the vertex `v` (if `v` is not 0 and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and minus `v`, `v` and `u` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

In natural language: The values of `n` and `d` remain unchanged. The values of `v` and `u` are now the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, both `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. If `v` is a non-zero value and is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`. The program then breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
