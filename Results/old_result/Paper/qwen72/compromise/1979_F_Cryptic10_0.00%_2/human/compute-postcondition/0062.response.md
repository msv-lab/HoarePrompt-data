Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must be non-empty, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and the current value of `v` is 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
