Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5) representing the number of vertices in a graph. It constructs a path that includes all vertices from 1 to `n` in some order and prints this path as a space-separated list of integers. After the function concludes, `n` remains unchanged, `path` contains all vertices from 1 to `n` in the order they were added, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set. **
