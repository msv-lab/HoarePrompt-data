Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must be non-empty, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**. 

This means that the variables `v` and `u` have been assigned the values returned by the function `func_1` when called with the argument `d`, which is `n - 1`. The other variables (`n`, `d`, `path`, and `remaining_vertices`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
