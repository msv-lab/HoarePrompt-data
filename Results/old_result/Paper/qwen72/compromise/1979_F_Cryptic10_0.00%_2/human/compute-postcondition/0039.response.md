Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` contains the vertex `v` (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` and the current value of `v`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration. The current value of `v` is no longer in `remaining_vertices`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
