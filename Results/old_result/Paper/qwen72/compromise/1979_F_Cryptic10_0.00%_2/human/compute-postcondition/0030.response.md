The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. If `remaining_vertices` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any). For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is 0, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any) and must contain at least one element**
