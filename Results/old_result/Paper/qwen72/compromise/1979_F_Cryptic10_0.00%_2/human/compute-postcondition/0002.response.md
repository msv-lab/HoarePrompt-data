The only object in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, which is a set. The loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty. Given the state right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive), where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. This means `remaining_vertices` is not empty, as it contains at least one element (from 1 to n).

Since `remaining_vertices` is already non-empty, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of vertices in the graph; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)**
