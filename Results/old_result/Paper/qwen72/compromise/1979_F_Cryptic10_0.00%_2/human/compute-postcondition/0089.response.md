The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer with the constraint 2 <= n <= 10^5, representing the number of vertices in a graph. Since the output details are not provided, we can only describe the input parameter and the general context.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in a graph, where 2 <= n <= 10^5.**
