Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is 0, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), and `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any).**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop execution because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`d`**: After all iterations of the loop, `d` will be 0. The loop starts with `d` at `n - 1` and decrements `d` by 1 each iteration, stopping when `d` is -1. However, the loop body is not executed when `d` is -1, so the final value of `d` is 0.
- **`path`**: The loop appends at most one vertex to `path`. This happens if a suitable `v` (i.e., `v` is not 0 and is in `remaining_vertices`) is found during any of the iterations. If no such `v` is found, `path` remains empty.
- **`remaining_vertices`**: If a vertex `v` is added to `path`, it is removed from `remaining_vertices`. Otherwise, `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged. Thus, `remaining_vertices` will be the original set minus the vertex in `path` (if any).
