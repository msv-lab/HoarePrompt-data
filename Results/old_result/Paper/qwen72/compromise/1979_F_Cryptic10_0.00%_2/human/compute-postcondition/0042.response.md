Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `path` contains at most one vertex (if a suitable `v` was found and added), `remaining_vertices` is a set containing the integers from 1 to n (inclusive) minus the vertex in `path` (if any). `v` and `u` are now assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `v` is added to `path`, `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the program continues with the current iteration.**
