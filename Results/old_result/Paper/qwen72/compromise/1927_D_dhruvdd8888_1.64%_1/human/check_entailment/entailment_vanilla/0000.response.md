### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the length of the array `N`.
   - It reads the array `nums` and appends an extra `-1` to it. This is done to handle edge cases where the last element of the array is different from the previous one.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to track the start and end of segments of the same number and the current number.
   - It creates an array `arr` to store tuples of the form `(start, end, number)` for each segment of the same number in `nums`.

3. **Segment Identification**:
   - The loop iterates through the array `nums` and identifies segments where the number changes.
   - For each segment, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`, where `s` is the start index and `i` is the end index of the segment.
   - It updates `s` to the current index `i` and `num` to the current number `nums[i]`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It retrieves the segment `(s, e, num)` from `arr` using `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the last index of `arr`.

5. **Output Logic**:
   - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no different elements). Otherwise, it prints `s-1` and `s` (the last element of the previous segment and the first element of the current segment).
   - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no different elements within the range).
   - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N`, it prints `s` and `e+1` (the first element of the current segment and the first element of the next segment).
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Use of `input`**:
   - The function `func_1` redefines `input` to `sys.stdin.readline`. This is problematic because it shadows the built-in `input` function, which can lead to unexpected behavior if `input` is used elsewhere in the function.

2. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment starting at or after `l`, but it does not correctly handle the case where the segment starts exactly at `l` and ends before `r`.
   - The logic for determining if a pair of different elements exists within the range `(l, r)` is flawed. It does not correctly check if there are different elements within the segment or across segments.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the entire range `(l, r)` is within a single segment of the same number correctly.
   - The program does not handle the case where the range `(l, r)` spans multiple segments correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly handle all cases and may produce incorrect results for some queries.

**Correctness: False**
