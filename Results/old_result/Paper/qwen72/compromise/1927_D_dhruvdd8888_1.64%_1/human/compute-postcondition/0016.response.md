The function `func_1` is designed to accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and a list of queries. Each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains `n` integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The list of queries contains `q` queries where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

The function returns a list of results corresponding to each query. For each query `(l, r)`, the function returns the result of some operation (not specified in the constraints) performed on the sublist `a[l:r+1]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a list of queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the operation performed on the sublist `a[l:r+1]` for each query. If the function is called multiple times, it processes each test case independently.**
