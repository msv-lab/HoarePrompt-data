Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input with an additional `-1` appended at the end, `N` is an input integer, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a contiguous segment of the same integer in `nums`, along with the integer itself, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.** 

The code snippet `LA = len(arr) - 1` assigns the value of `len(arr) - 1` to the variable `LA`. The length of `arr` is the number of tuples in the list, and `LA` is one less than this length. All other variables remain unchanged.
