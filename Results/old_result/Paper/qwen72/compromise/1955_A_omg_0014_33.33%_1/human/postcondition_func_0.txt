The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, and for each of the `n` iterations, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It calculates `d` as `c` divided by 2. If the product of `a` and `b` is less than the product of `a` and `d`, it prints `a * b`. Otherwise, it prints the rounded value of `a * d`. The function does not return any value. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
