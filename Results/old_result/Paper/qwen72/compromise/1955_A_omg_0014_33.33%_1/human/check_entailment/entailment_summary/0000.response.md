Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` in the program do not match the problem's input description, which specifies that the inputs are `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` is used in the program where `b` (the price for two yogurts on promotion) should be. Additionally, the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The program calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`, which does not align with the problem's requirements. The correct approach should involve comparing the cost of buying yogurts individually with the cost of buying them in pairs.

The correct logic should be:
1. Calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts individually: `n * a`.
2. Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buying the remaining yogurts individually:
   - Number of pairs: `n // 2`.
   - Cost of pairs: `(n // 2) * b`.
   - Cost of remaining yogurts: `(n % 2) * a`.
3. The minimum cost is the lesser of the two calculated costs.

Given the execution summary and the program's logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
