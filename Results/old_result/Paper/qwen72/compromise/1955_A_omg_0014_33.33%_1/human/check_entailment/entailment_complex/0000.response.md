Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem statement. However, the function should read `t` instead of `n` for the number of test cases, and then use `t` in the loop.

2. **Variable Names and Input Parsing**: The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, but the variable names do not match the problem description. According to the problem, the inputs should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of yogurts, `a` is the price of one yogurt, and `b` is the price of two yogurts on promotion. The function incorrectly uses `a`, `b`, and `c` for these values.

3. **Calculation of `d`**: The function calculates `d` as `c / 2`. This is incorrect because `c` should be `b` (the price of two yogurts on promotion), and `d` should be the price of one yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotion price, which is `b / 2`.

4. **Comparison and Output**: The function compares `a * b` with `a * d` and prints the minimum value. This is incorrect because:
   - `a * b` should be `n * a` (the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price).
   - `a * d` should be `n // 2 * b + (n % 2) * a` (the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price).

5. **Rounding**: The function rounds the value of `a * d` before printing. This is unnecessary because the cost should be an integer, and the calculation should naturally produce an integer.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
