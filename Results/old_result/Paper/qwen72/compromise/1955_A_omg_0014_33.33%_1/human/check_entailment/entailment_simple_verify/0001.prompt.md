You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: The loop iterates n times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers a, b, and c from the input. It then calculates d as c divided by 2. If the product of a and b is less than the product of a and d, it prints a * b. Otherwise, it prints the rounded value of a * d. The values of t and n remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Variable Assignment**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and assigns them using `map(int, input().split())`. However, the problem description specifies that the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, not `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is a discrepancy in the variable names.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`. This is intended to represent the price per yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotion price. However, `c` is not defined in the problem statement, and the correct variable should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts).
   - The program then checks if `a * b < a * d`. This condition is incorrect because `a * b` should be the total cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price, and `a * d` should be the total cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price and the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition `a * b < a * d` is true, the program prints `a * b`. This is incorrect because `a * b` is not the correct expression for the minimum cost.
   - If the condition is false, the program prints `round(a * d)`. This is also incorrect because `a * d` is not the correct expression for the minimum cost.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should involve comparing the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The minimum cost can be calculated as follows:
     - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought: `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculate the cost of buying these pairs at the promotion price: `promotion_cost = pairs * b`.
     - Calculate the number of remaining yogurts: `remaining = n % 2`.
     - Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price: `remaining_cost = remaining * a`.
     - The total minimum cost is `promotion_cost + remaining_cost`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
