Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`. This is correct as per the problem statement.

2. **Variable Assignment**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` and assigns them using `map(int, input().split())`. However, the problem description specifies that the input should be `n`, `a`, and `b`, not `a`, `b`, and `c`. This is a discrepancy in the variable names, and the correct variables should be `n`, `a`, and `b`.

3. **Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d` as `c / 2`. This is intended to represent the price per yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotion price. However, `c` is not defined in the problem statement, and the correct variable should be `b` (the promotion price for two yogurts).
   - The program then checks if `a * b < a * d`. This condition is incorrect because `a * b` should be the total cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotion price, and `a * d` should be the total cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price. The correct comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price and the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the promotion price.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition `a * b < a * d` is true, the program prints `a * b`. This is incorrect because `a * b` is not the correct expression for the minimum cost.
   - If the condition is false, the program prints `round(a * d)`. This is also incorrect because `a * d` is not the correct expression for the minimum cost.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should involve comparing the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) with the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The minimum cost can be calculated as follows:
     - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought: `pairs = n // 2`.
     - Calculate the cost of buying these pairs at the promotion price: `promotion_cost = pairs * b`.
     - Calculate the number of remaining yogurts: `remaining = n % 2`.
     - Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price: `remaining_cost = remaining * a`.
     - The total minimum cost is `promotion_cost + remaining_cost`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is indeed incorrect. The variable names and the logic used to calculate the minimum cost are flawed.

Final: **False**
