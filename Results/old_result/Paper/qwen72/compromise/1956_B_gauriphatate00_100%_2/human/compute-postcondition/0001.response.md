The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, the list `a` must not be empty. Given the initial state, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times, and `n` is a positive integer. Since `n` is a positive integer, `a` must have at least one element, ensuring that the loop can execute.

Before the loop starts, `count_a` is an empty dictionary, but this does not affect the loop's execution directly. The loop will start with `num` being the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`a` is a list of integers of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`), and each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list `a` at most 2 times. `n` is a positive integer. `num` is the first element in the list `a`. `count_a` is an empty dictionary.**
