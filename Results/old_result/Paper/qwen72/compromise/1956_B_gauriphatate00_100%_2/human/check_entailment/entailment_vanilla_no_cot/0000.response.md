Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem based on the given description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Cards**: The function `func_1` creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand. This is necessary to determine how many of each card you have.

3. **Calculating Maximum Score**: The function iterates through each integer from 1 to `n` and checks if it appears in your hand. If an integer appears exactly twice in your hand, you can score 1 point for that integer by playing both cards optimally. The program correctly sums up these points to get the maximum score you can achieve.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results for each test case and prints them after processing all test cases.

The logic in the program ensures that you maximize your score by playing both cards of any integer that appears twice in your hand, and Nene's optimal play is implicitly considered by the fact that you only score points for integers that you have both cards of. This aligns with the problem's requirements and constraints.
