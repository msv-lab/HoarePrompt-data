Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is a dictionary with `current_key` mapped to 1, `arr` must contain at least two elements, `num` is the second element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r_y = num % y` calculates the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and assigns it to `r_y`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of `r_y` is now the result of `num % y`, and `r_x` is still the result of `-num % x`. The `current_key` is still a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y`.
