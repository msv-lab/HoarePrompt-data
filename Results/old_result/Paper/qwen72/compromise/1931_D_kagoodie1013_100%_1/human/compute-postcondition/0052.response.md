Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the first element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x`, `r_y` is `num % y`, `current_key` is not relevant for the loop to start.**

The code snippet `r_y = num % y` calculates the remainder of `num` when divided by `y` and assigns it to `r_y`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
