To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` from each tuple in `test_cases`.

1. **`test_cases`**: This is the list of tuples that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
2. **`(n, x, y, arr)`**: These are the elements unpacked from each tuple in `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is not empty, and the first tuple will be unpacked into `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples.
- `results` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple for the loop to execute. The state of `results` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `results` is an empty list, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`**
