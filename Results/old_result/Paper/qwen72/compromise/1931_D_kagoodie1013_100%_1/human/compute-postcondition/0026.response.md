Output State: **`test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is 0, `residue_map` is an empty dictionary, `arr` is the array part of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `num` is undefined for the next iteration, `r_x` is undefined for the next iteration, `r_y` is undefined for the next iteration, `current_key` is undefined for the next iteration.**

The code initializes `residue_map` as an empty dictionary, while all other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
