Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each tuple to count how many pairs of integers in `a` satisfy the condition that the negative residue of the first integer modulo `x` and the positive residue of the second integer modulo `y` are the same. The function returns a list `results` containing the count for each tuple in `test_cases`. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and any internal state (like the `residue_map` dictionary) is reset after processing each tuple. **
