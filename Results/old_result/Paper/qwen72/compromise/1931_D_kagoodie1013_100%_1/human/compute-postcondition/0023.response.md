Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of times the same `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been encountered in `arr`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value is the count of how many times this `(num % x, num % y)` pair has been encountered, `arr` remains unchanged, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.**
