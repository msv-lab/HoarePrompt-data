The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `x`, `y` (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, `1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9`), and a list `a` of `n` integers (where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9`). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.

The function processes each tuple in `test_cases` and returns a list `results` containing the final value of `count` for each tuple. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, and the `residue_map` dictionary is reset to an empty dictionary after each tuple is processed.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` containing the final value of `count` for each tuple, while keeping `test_cases` unchanged and resetting a dictionary `residue_map` after processing each tuple.**
