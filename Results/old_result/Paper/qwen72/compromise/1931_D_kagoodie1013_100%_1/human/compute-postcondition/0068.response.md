Output State: **The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of pairs in `arr` that have the same residues as previously seen elements, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` and each value is the count of how many times that tuple has been encountered, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is `num % y` for the last element, and `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element.**

### Explanation:
- **`test_cases` list remains unchanged**: The loop does not modify the `test_cases` list.
- **`results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values**: The loop does not modify the `results` list directly, but `count` will be added to `results` after the loop completes.
- **`(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`**: The loop does not change the tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`.
- **`count` is the total number of pairs in `arr` that have the same residues as previously seen elements**: `count` is incremented each time a pair of residues `(num % x, num % y)` is found in `residue_map`.
- **`residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` and each value is the count of how many times that tuple has been encountered**: The dictionary `residue_map` keeps track of the frequency of each residue pair.
- **`arr` contains all the elements it originally had**: The loop does not modify the `arr` list.
- **`num` is the last element of `arr`**: After the loop completes, `num` will be the last element of `arr`.
- **`r_x` is `-num % x` for the last element**: `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x` for the last element of `arr`.
- **`r_y` is `num % y` for the last element**: `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y` for the last element of `arr`.
- **`current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element**: `current_key` is the tuple containing the residues of the last element of `arr`.
