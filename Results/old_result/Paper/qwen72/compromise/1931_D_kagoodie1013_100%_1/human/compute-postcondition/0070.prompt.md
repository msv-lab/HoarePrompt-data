Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9) and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    residue_map = {}
    for num in arr:
        r_x = -num % x
        r_y = num % y
        count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
        current_key = num % x, num % y
        residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of times the same `(r_x, r_y)` pair has been encountered in `arr`, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for each `num` in `arr`, and the value is the count of how many times this `(num % x, num % y)` pair has been encountered, `arr` remains unchanged, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element of `arr`, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element of `arr`, `current_key` is a tuple containing the values `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of pairs in `arr` that have the same `(num % x, num % y)` residues as any previous elements, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` and each value is the count of how many times this tuple appears in `arr`, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is the result of `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is the result of `num % y` for the last element, and `current_key` is a tuple containing the values of `num % x` and `num % y` for the last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The `test_cases` list remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the previously stored values, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `count` is the total number of pairs in `arr` that have the same residues as previously seen elements, `residue_map` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` and each value is the count of how many times that tuple has been encountered, `arr` contains all the elements it originally had, `num` is the last element of `arr`, `r_x` is `-num % x` for the last element, `r_y` is `num % y` for the last element, and `current_key` is a tuple `(num % x, num % y)` for the last element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
