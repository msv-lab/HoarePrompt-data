Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input in the correct format and processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

2. **Residue Calculation**: For each number in the array, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y`:
   - `r_x = -num % x` ensures that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - `r_y = num % y` ensures that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs with the same residues. For each number `num` in the array, it checks if there are any existing numbers in the array that can form a beautiful pair with `num` by looking up the dictionary with the key `(r_x, r_y)`. If such a pair exists, it increments the count.

4. **Updating the Dictionary**: After checking for pairs, it updates the dictionary with the current key `(num % x, num % y)` to include the current number in the count for future pairs.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and potential inputs as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
