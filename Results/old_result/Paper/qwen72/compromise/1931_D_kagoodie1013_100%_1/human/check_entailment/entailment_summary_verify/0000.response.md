### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to evaluate its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Residue Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `r_x` and `r_y` for each number in the array:
     - `r_x = -num % x` is intended to ensure that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
     - `r_y = num % y` is intended to ensure that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - However, there is a subtle issue here. The calculation `r_x = -num % x` does not necessarily ensure that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. Instead, it calculates the negative residue, which is not the same as the residue needed for the sum condition.

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the counts of pairs with the same residues.
   - For each number `num` in the array, it checks if there are any existing numbers in the array that can form a beautiful pair with `num` by looking up the dictionary with the key `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - If such a pair exists, it increments the count.
   - After checking for pairs, it updates the dictionary with the current key `(num % x, num % y)` to include the current number in the count for future pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Issue Identification:
- The calculation `r_x = -num % x` is incorrect for ensuring that `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`. The correct calculation should be `r_x = num % x` for both the sum and difference conditions.
- The correct condition for a beautiful pair is:
  - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if and only if `a_i % x + a_j % x == 0` (or `a_i % x == -a_j % x`).
  - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if and only if `a_i % y == a_j % y`.

### Corrected Code:
To correct the issue, we need to adjust the residue calculations:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for num in arr:
            r_x = num % x
            r_y = num % y
            count += residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)
            current_key = (num % x, num % y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the residue calculation for `r_x` was incorrect.
- The corrected code ensures that the sum and difference conditions are correctly checked using the appropriate residues.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the corrected program is correct.)
