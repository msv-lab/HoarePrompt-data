Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are a few issues:

1. **Handling of Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program checks if `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` to determine if it's impossible to accommodate the participants. However, this condition is not sufficient to cover all cases where it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts.
   - For example, in the test case `1 4 1`, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` because it doesn't account for the fact that one universal can be paired with one extrovert to form a tent of three people, and the remaining three extroverts can form another tent of three people.

2. **Calculation of Tents:**
   - The program calculates the number of tents as `k += a + (b + c) // 3` and then adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the distribution of universals and extroverts.
   - For example, in the test case `1 1 1`, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` instead of `2` (one tent for the introvert and one tent for the extrovert and the universal).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Ensure that each introvert gets their own tent.
2. Ensure that each extrovert is part of a tent with exactly two other people.
3. Use the universals to fill in the remaining spots in the tents.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Introverts need their own tents
        tents = a
        
        # Extroverts need to be in groups of 3
        if b > c + (3 * a):
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Use universals to fill in the remaining spots for extroverts
        b_needed = b // 3
        b_remaining = b % 3
        c_used = min(c, 3 * b_remaining)
        
        # If we can't form the required groups of 3 for extroverts, it's impossible
        if b_remaining > 0 and c_used < 3 * b_remaining:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Add the tents for extroverts
        tents += b_needed
        if b_remaining > 0:
            tents += 1
        
        # Remaining universals can be placed in any tent
        c -= c_used
        if c > 0:
            tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        print(tents)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Introverts:** Each introvert needs their own tent, so we start by adding `a` to the total number of tents.
2. **Extroverts:** We need to form groups of 3 for the extroverts. If the number of extroverts is greater than the number of universals plus three times the number of introverts, it's impossible to accommodate them.
3. **Universals for Extroverts:** We use universals to fill in the remaining spots for the extroverts. If we can't form the required groups of 3, we output `-1`.
4. **Remaining Universals:** After accommodating the extroverts, any remaining universals can be placed in any tent, and we calculate the number of additional tents needed for them.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
