The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function calculates a value `k` based on these inputs and prints it. If the conditions `(b % 3 != 0 and c < 3) and (b + c) % 3 != 0` are met, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates `k` as `a + (b + c) // 3` and adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the ones from the last test case, and `n` will remain unchanged.
