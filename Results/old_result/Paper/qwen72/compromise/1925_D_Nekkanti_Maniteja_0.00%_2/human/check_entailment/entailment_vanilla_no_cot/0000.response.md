Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The key issue is in the loop where the expected value is being computed:

```python
for i in range(k):
    s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
```

This loop incorrectly assumes that the friendship value of a pair increases linearly with each excursion. However, the problem statement specifies that the friendship value of a pair increases by 1 only if the pair is chosen, and this choice is random and independent for each excursion.

The correct approach to calculate the expected value involves understanding that the expected increase in the friendship value of a pair of friends is the probability of that pair being chosen in a given excursion. The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\). Therefore, the expected increase in the friendship value of a pair of friends in one excursion is \(\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).

Given that there are \(m\) pairs of friends, the expected increase in the total sum of friendship values in one excursion is \(m \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\). This expected increase is the same for each of the \(k\) excursions.

The initial sum of friendship values is \(a\), and the expected increase over \(k\) excursions is \(k \times m \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\). Therefore, the expected value of the sum of friendship values after \(k\) excursions is:

\[ a + k \times m \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \]

This can be simplified and computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)  # Corrected: divide by 2
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        expected_increase = (k * m * c) % M
        result = (a + expected_increase) % M
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values after \(k\) excursions.
