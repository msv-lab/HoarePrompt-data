Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is the second input integer, `u` and `v` are integers provided by the user, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `s` is updated to `s + c * 1 * c * m + c * a`**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 1.
- `k` remains greater than 1.
- `m` remains the second input integer.
- `u` and `v` remain the integers provided by the user.
- `a` remains the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations.
- `s` is updated to `s + c * 1 * c * m + c * a`, which simplifies to `s + c * c * m + c * a`.
