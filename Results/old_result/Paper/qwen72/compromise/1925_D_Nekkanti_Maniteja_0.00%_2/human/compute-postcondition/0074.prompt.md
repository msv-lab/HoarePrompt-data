You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5. Additionally, m lines follow, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 1, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: `i` is `k-1`, `s` is `s + c * (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1)) * c * m + c * a * k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` with specific constraints, and `m` lines of friendship data. It processes these test cases and returns a result based on the friendship values and relationships between the children.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
