You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code:

for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition provided is incomplete. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, k):` where `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1.
    #State: `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). `n` is not equal to 0.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: `n` is 0, `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n` (including the leading 1).
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Single Element Case (n == 1):**
   - If `n` is 1, the program simply prints `k` because the sequence must contain exactly one element, and that element must be `k` to satisfy the sum condition.

3. **Multiple Elements Case (n > 1):**
   - The program aims to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - It uses a function `func_1` to determine the highest bit position that is set in `k`.
   - The function `func_1` works by right-shifting `n` until it becomes 0, counting the number of shifts, which corresponds to the highest bit position.
   - The program then constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position determined by `func_1`.
     - It appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the sequence. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k`.
     - It appends `0` for the remaining `n - 2` elements to ensure the sequence has `n` elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed sequence for each test case.

### Analysis of the Approach:

- **Sum Condition:**
  - The sum of the sequence is `k` because the first element is `2 ** counter - 1` and the second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, and the remaining elements are `0`.
  - This satisfies the condition \(\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k\).

- **Maximizing 1s in Binary Representation:**
  - The value `2 ** counter - 1` is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`.
  - The bitwise OR of `2 ** counter - 1` and any other number will have at least as many 1s as `2 ** counter - 1`.
  - By choosing `2 ** counter - 1` as the first element and `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` as the second element, we ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible.
  - The remaining elements are `0`, which do not affect the bitwise OR operation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that satisfies both conditions: the sum of the sequence is `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

### Correctness:
**True**
