The only variables in the loop head are `n` and `position`, but the condition for the loop to execute is solely dependent on `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is not equal to 0. According to the state before the loop, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), which means `n` is already not equal to 0. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), `n` is not equal to 0, `position` is 0**
