The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`. However, the provided function definition only includes one parameter, `n`. Given the constraints, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). The function always returns -1, regardless of the input values.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and `k` is an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). However, the function always returns -1, regardless of the input values.**
