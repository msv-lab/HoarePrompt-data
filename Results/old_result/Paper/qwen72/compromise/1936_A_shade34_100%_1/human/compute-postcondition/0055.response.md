Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mak` is 0
   - `mak2` is 0
   - `pans` must have at least 2 elements
   - `i` is 1

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement starts with a literal string `'?'`.
   - `pans[mak]` is the element at index `mak` in the list `pans`. Since `mak` is 0, this is `pans[0]`.
   - `pans[mak]` is repeated, so it will print `pans[0]` again.
   - `pans[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `pans`. Since `i` is 1, this is `pans[1]`.
   - `pans[i]` is repeated, so it will print `pans[1]` again.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the first element of `pans` twice, and then the second element of `pans` twice.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the list `pans` and [pans[1]] is the second element of the list `pans`)**
