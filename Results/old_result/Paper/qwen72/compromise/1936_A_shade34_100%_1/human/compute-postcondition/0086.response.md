Postcondition: ***`mak` is 0 or `len(pans)`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=", `i` is `len(pans)`, and `n` must be greater than `len(pans)`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, but no other variables have been modified. If the user input is "<", `mak` is set to `len(pans)`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
