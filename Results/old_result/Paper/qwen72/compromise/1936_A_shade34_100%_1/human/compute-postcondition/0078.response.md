The `sys.stdout.flush()` function flushes the standard output buffer, ensuring that all output is written immediately. This operation does not affect any of the variables in the current state.

Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=", `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1**
