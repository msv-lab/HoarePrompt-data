Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices. The goal is to find indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was '>', `mak2` is 0, `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=", and `i` is `len(pans) - 1`. If no '>' inputs were received, `mak` will be 0. The `sys.stdout.flush()` call ensures that any buffered output is written to the terminal immediately, but does not change any variable values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was ">", `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<", `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `n` is the input integer, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` will still contain all indices for which the user input was "=" or "<", `mak` will be the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was ">", and `s` will be the last user input string. The output buffer will have been flushed multiple times during the loop execution, and the output buffer will be flushed again.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
