The code `pans.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `pans`. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the input string. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is equal to the value of `i`, and `pans` is a list containing the value of `i` plus the newly appended value of `i`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` now includes the value of `i` plus the newly appended value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged except for the newly appended value of `i`.**
