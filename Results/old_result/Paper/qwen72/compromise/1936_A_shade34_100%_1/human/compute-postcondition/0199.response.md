The code snippet sets the variable `mak` to 0. This overrides any previous value that `mak` might have had. The other variables (`i`, `pans`, `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `n-1`, `mak` is 0, `pans` will contain all indices `i` for which the user input was "=" or "<", and `s` will be the last user input string.**
