Output State: **`mak` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak2` is 0, `pans` contains all values of `i` for which the user input was either "<" or "=", `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current user input is "<".** 

The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is `len(pans) - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
