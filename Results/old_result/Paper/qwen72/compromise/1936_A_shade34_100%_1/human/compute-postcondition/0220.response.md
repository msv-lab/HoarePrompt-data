The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates in an environment with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function aims to find two indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p[i]` and `p[j]` (denoted as `p_i ⊕ p_j`) is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices.
