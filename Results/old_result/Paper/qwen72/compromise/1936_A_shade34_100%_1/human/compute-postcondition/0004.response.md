Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `mak` is 0.

The print statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Let's break down what will be printed:

- The first part of the print statement is a string `'?'`, which will be printed as is.
- The next two parts are the value of `mak`, which is 0. So, both `mak` values will be printed as 0.
- The last two parts are the value of `i`, which is 1. So, both `i` values will be printed as 1.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
