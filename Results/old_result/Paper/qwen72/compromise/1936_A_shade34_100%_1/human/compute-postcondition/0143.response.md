Output State: **`mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was ">", `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<", `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `n` is the input integer, and the last user input string `s` is either ">" or the previous value.**

### Explanation:
- **`mak`**: This variable tracks the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was ">". If no such input was given, `mak` will remain 0.
- **`mak2`**: This variable remains unchanged and still holds the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<".
- **`pans`**: The list `pans` remains unchanged as it contains all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<".
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `len(pans) - 1` because the loop iterates from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.
- **`n`**: The input integer `n` remains unchanged.
- **`s`**: The last user input string `s` will be either ">" or the previous value, depending on the last iteration of the loop.
