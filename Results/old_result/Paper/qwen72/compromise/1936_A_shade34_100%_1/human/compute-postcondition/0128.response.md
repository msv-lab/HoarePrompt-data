Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `mak` is 0.
2. `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution.
3. `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements.
4. `i` is `n-1`.
5. `n` is the input integer.
6. `s` is the last user input string.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Analysis:
1. **`mak`**: This is explicitly given as 0.
2. **`pans[mak]`**: Since `mak` is 0, this will be the first element of the list `pans`.
3. **`i`**: This is given as `n-1`, where `n` is the input integer.
4. **`pans[i]`**: This will be the element at index `n-1` of the list `pans`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the following:
- The string `'?'`
- The first element of the list `pans` (since `mak` is 0)
- The first element of the list `pans` again
- The element at index `n-1` of the list `pans`
- The element at index `n-1` of the list `pans` again

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n-1]] [pans[n-1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the list pans and pans[n-1] is the element at index n-1 of the list pans)**
