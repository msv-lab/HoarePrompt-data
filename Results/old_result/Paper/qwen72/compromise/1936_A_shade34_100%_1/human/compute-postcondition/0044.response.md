Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than 2 (though this value is not directly used in the print statement).
   - `mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is 0.
   - `s` is a string input by the user.
   - `pans` is `[1]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak` depends on the value of `s`:
     - If `s` is `<`, then `mak` is 1.
     - Otherwise, `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is always 0.
   - `i` is always 2.
   - `mak2` is always 0.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `s` is `<`:
     - `mak` is 1.
     - The print statement will output: `? 1 0 2 0`.
   - If `s` is not `<`:
     - `mak` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 2 0`.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be one of the following:

- If `s` is `<`:
  Output: **? 1 0 2 0**
- If `s` is not `<`:
  Output: **? 0 0 2 0**

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the most precise and general answer based on the given information is:

Output: **? [mak] 0 2 0 (where [mak] is 1 if s is `<` and 0 otherwise)**
