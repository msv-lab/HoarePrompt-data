Output State: **The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of selected indices. The goal is to find indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The input provided must be greater than 0. `n` is an input integer. `mak` is 0.**
