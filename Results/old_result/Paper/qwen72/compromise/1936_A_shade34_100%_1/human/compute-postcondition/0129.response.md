The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call forces the standard output buffer to flush, ensuring that any buffered output is written immediately. This operation does not change the values of any variables or affect the program state beyond ensuring that any pending output is displayed.

Output State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, and `s` is the last user input string.**
