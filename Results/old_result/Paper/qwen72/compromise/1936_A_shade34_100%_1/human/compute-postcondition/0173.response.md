The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to the variable `mak`. Since the value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, we only know that `mak` now holds whatever value `i` had before this assignment. The conditions regarding `n` being greater than 0 and `s` being the input string with the value `<` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is the input string and its value is `<`, `mak` is equal to the value of `i`.**
