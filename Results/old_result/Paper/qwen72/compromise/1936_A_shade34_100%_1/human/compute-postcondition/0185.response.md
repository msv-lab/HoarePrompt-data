Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `s` is the input string, `pans` is a list containing the value of `i`. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is equal to the value of `i`. If `s` is `=`, `pans` now includes the value of `i`. Otherwise, `pans` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `pans` is updated to be a list containing the value of `i`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The conditions for updating `mak` and `pans` based on the value of `s` are still valid and unchanged.
