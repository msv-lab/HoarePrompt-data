To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop and the state before the loop starts.

### Given State Before the Loop Starts:
- `mak` is 0
- `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution
- `pans` is a list containing all values of `i` for which the user input was "=" or the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<"
- `i` is `n-1`
- `n` is the input integer
- `s` is the last user input string

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `pans`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `len(pans)` is greater than 1. This is because the range function `range(1, len(pans))` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to (but not including) `len(pans)`. If `len(pans)` is less than or equal to 1, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`pans`**: For the loop to execute, `pans` must have at least 2 elements. This ensures that `len(pans)` is greater than 1.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so we don't need to adjust it manually. However, it will start from 1 as specified in the loop head.

### Final State:
The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `pans` has at least 2 elements. The other variables (`mak`, `mak2`, `n`, and `s`) are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest value of `i` for which the user input was "<" during the loop's execution, `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is the input integer, and `s` is the last user input string**
