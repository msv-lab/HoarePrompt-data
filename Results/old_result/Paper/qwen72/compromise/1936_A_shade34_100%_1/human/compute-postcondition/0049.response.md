Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is a new string input by the user, `pans` is `[1, 2]` if `s` is `<` or `=`, otherwise `pans` is `[2]` if `s` is neither `<` nor `=`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pans.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `pans`.
- If `s` is `<` or `=`, `pans` was initially `[1]`, so after appending `i`, `pans` becomes `[1, 2]`.
- If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `pans` was initially an empty list, so after appending `i`, `pans` becomes `[2]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `mak`, `mak2`, and `s`) remain unchanged.
