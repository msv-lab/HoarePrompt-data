### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index (`mak`):**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0 and iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1`.
   - For each index `i`, it queries the comparison of `(p_mak | p_mak)` and `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i`. This ensures that `mak` is the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation.

3. **Finding Potential Candidates (`pans`):**
   - The program initializes `mak2` to `mak` and creates an empty list `pans`.
   - It iterates through all indices from 0 to `n-1` and queries the comparison of `(p_mak | p_mak2)` and `(p_i | p_mak2)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to `i` and sets `pans` to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `pans`.
   - This step identifies all indices `i` such that `(p_i | p_mak2)` is equal to `(p_mak | p_mak2)`.

4. **Finding the Maximum XOR Pair:**
   - The program initializes `mak` to 0 and iterates through the indices in `pans`.
   - For each index `i` in `pans`, it queries the comparison of `(p_pans[mak] | p_pans[mak])` and `(p_pans[i] | p_pans[i])`.
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to `i`.
   - This step ensures that `mak` is the index of the element in `pans` with the highest value.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program outputs the indices `mak2` and `pans[mak]` as the pair with the maximum XOR value.
   - The output buffer is flushed after each query and after the final output.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It uses the allowed number of queries to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized. The logic for finding the maximum XOR pair is sound and adheres to the given constraints.

**Correctness: True**
