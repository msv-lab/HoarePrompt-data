### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list of ratings `a`.
   - It adjusts `k` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1 from it.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of ratings `a`.
   - It initializes `x` to be the rating of the cow at position `k`.
   - It then iterates through the list `a` to find the indices of the first two elements that have a rating higher than `x`. These indices are stored in the list `ind`, and the count `c` is incremented each time a higher rating is found.
   - The iteration stops as soon as `c` reaches 2, meaning it has found the first two elements with higher ratings.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **No Higher Ratings (`ind` is empty):**
     - If no elements in `a` have a higher rating than `x`, the function returns `n - 1`. This is correct because if your cow has the highest rating, it will win all `n-1` matches.
   - **One Higher Rating (`len(ind) == 1`):**
     - If there is only one element in `a` with a higher rating than `x`:
       - If this element is at index 0, the function returns `k - 1`. This is correct because if the only higher-rated cow is at the start, your cow can win all matches up to its original position.
       - If this element is at an index greater than `k`, the function returns `ind[0] - 1`. This is correct because your cow can win all matches up to the position of the higher-rated cow.
       - If this element is at an index less than or equal to `k`, the function returns `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)`. This is correct because it considers the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve by either moving forward or backward.
   - **Two Higher Ratings (`len(ind) == 2`):**
     - If there are two elements in `a` with higher ratings than `x`:
       - If the first higher-rated cow is at index 0, the function returns `min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)`. This is correct because it considers the minimum number of wins your cow can achieve by either moving forward to the second higher-rated cow or staying in its original position.
       - If the first higher-rated cow is not at index 0 and `k` is greater than the second higher-rated cow's index, the function returns `max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])`. This is correct because it considers the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve by either moving forward to the first higher-rated cow or moving backward to the second higher-rated cow.
       - If the first higher-rated cow is not at index 0 and `k` is less than or equal to the second higher-rated cow's index, the function returns `max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])`. This is correct because it considers the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve by either moving forward to the first higher-rated cow or staying in its original position.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. It finds the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve by either not swapping or swapping optimally. The logic is sound and the conditions are correctly checked.

**Correctness: True**
