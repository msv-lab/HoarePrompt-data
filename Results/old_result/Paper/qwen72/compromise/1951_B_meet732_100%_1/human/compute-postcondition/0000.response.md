Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 <= n <= 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`.** 

In natural language: The list `a` remains unchanged, containing `n` unique integers where `2 <= n <= 10^5` and each integer `a_i` is within the range `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. The variable `x` is now equal to the integer at the `k`-th index of the list `a`.
