The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where `2 <= n <= 10^5`, and each integer `a_i` is unique and within the range `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.

The function returns different values based on the following cases:
- **Case_1**: If the function determines a condition that is not specified, it returns `n - 1`.
- **Case_2**: If `k` is an index in the list `a` such that `x = a[k]` and `k` is at least 1, the function returns `k - 1`.
- **Case_3**: If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x` and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`, the function returns `ind[0] - 1`.
- **Case_4**: If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x` and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
- **Case_5**: If `ind` has at least two elements, the function returns the minimum value between the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1.
- **Case_6**: If `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `x`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`.
- **Case_7**: If `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than `x` and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`, the function returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `a` of `n` unique integers, where `2 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`. It returns a value based on the following cases: (1) `n - 1` if a certain unspecified condition is met, (2) `k - 1` if `k` is an index in `a` such that `x = a[k]` and `k` is at least 1, (3) `ind[0] - 1` if `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` greater than `x` and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`, (4) the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1` if `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` greater than `x` and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, (5) the minimum of the second element of `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1 if `ind` has at least two elements, (6) the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]` if `ind` contains the indices of the first two elements in `a` greater than `x`, (7) the maximum of `ind[0] - 1` and `k - ind[0]` if `ind[0]` is the index of the first element in `a` greater than `x` and `k` is less than or equal to `ind[1]`.**
