### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()` Implementation:**
   - The function reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, where `n` is the length of the strings to check, `k` is the number of alphabets to use, and `m` is the length of the string `s`.
   - It then reads the string `s` from the input.
   - A set `us` is created containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - Another set `win` is initialized to keep track of the characters seen in the current window.
   - An empty list `ans` is initialized to store the characters that form a valid subsequence.
   - A variable `ps` is initialized to count the number of valid subsequences found.

3. **Processing the String `s`:**
   - The program iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `i` is in the set `us`, it is added to the set `win`.
   - If the set `win` contains all `k` characters, the character `i` is added to the list `ans`, and `ps` is incremented.
   - The set `win` is then cleared to start a new window.

4. **Checking the Result:**
   - After processing the string `s`, the program checks if `ps` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - If `ps >= n`, it prints "YES" because it means all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - If `ps < n`, it prints "NO" and then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

5. **Constructing the Missing Subsequence:**
   - The program iterates over the set `us` to find a character that is not in the set `win`.
   - If such a character is found, it is added to the list `ans` to form a missing subsequence.
   - The remaining characters in the subsequence are filled with 'a' to ensure the length is `n`.

### Evaluation:

- **Incorrect Subsequence Check:**
  - The program only checks if there are `n` windows where all `k` characters are present. This is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets occur as subsequences.
  - For example, if `s = "abba"`, `n = 2`, and `k = 2`, the program will find two windows (`"ab"` and `"ba"`) and print "YES". However, it should also check for the subsequences "aa" and "bb".

- **Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence:**
  - The program constructs a missing subsequence by finding a character not in `win` and appending it to `ans`. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid missing subsequence.
  - For example, if `s = "abb"`, `n = 2`, and `k = 2`, the program will print "NO" and then "aa", which is incorrect because "aa" is not a valid missing subsequence.

- **Logical Flaw:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` does not contain all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. It only checks for the presence of `k` characters in a window, which is not the same as checking for all possible subsequences.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to check all possible subsequences of length `n` and incorrectly constructs the missing subsequence.

Final: **False**
