Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**:
   - The program attempts to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. However, it does not generate or check all possible strings of length `n`.
   - Instead, it uses a sliding window approach to track the characters in `s` and only checks if a set of `k` characters can be found in a window. This is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Output for "NO" Case**:
   - When the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, it prints a string that is not necessarily a valid answer. The string it prints is constructed by appending characters to `ans` and then adding a character not in `win` and padding with 'a'. This does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

3. **Logical Errors**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where `ps` (the number of times a set of `k` characters is found) is less than `n`. It should generate a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence, but it does not do this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" followed by that string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabet = ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabet, repeat=n)]
    
    for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(possible_string, s):
            print('NO')
            print(possible_string)
            return
    print('YES')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Generate All Possible Strings**:
   - `product(alphabet, repeat=n)` generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   
2. **Check Subsequence**:
   - `is_subsequence(x, s)` checks if string `x` is a subsequence of string `s` using an iterator and the `all` function.
   
3. **Output**:
   - If any of the generated strings is not a subsequence of `s`, the program prints "NO" followed by that string.
   - If all generated strings are subsequences, the program prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks all possible strings and provides the correct output for each test case.
