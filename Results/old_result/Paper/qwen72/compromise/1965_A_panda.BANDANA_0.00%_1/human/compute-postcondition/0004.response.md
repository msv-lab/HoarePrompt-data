Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input, representing the number of stones in each pile. The function then checks if any pile contains exactly 1 stone. If so, it prints "Bob" for that test case; otherwise, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` are no longer in scope after the function completes. **
