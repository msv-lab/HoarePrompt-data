Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes a list of strings `data` containing input data for `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. It extracts paths from `data` and applies `func_1` to each path, storing the results in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results` to the standard output. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `data`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged, and the results of the test cases have been printed to the standard output. **
