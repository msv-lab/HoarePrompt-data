You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a list of strings where each string is either '@', indicating a sign of the apocalypse, or '*', indicating an invalid or non-apocalyptic event.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if (path[0] == '@') :
        dp[0] = 1
    else :
        if (path[0] == '*') :
            dp[0] = -float('inf')
        #State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n` except `dp[0]` which is `-inf`, and the first element of `path` is '*'
    #State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf`.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 1, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[1]` is 2.
    #State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf`. If `n` > 1 and the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is `-inf`. If `n` > 1 and the second element of `path` is '@', then `dp[1]` is 2.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: `dp` is a list where each element is either `-inf` or a positive integer. The value of `dp[i]` for `i >= 2` is determined by the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@'. If `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is `-inf`. The initial values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain unchanged.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than `-inf`. This value is a positive integer, as `dp[i]` for `i >= 2` is either `-inf` or a positive integer, and the initial values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are also either `-inf` or positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of strings `path` where each string is either '@' or '*'. It returns 0 if there are no valid paths or no signs of the apocalypse. Otherwise, it returns the maximum positive integer from the list `dp` that represents the best possible outcome based on the path.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than `-inf`. This value is a positive integer, as `dp[i]` for `i >= 2` is either `-inf` or a positive integer, and the initial values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are also either `-inf` or positive integers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
