Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[1]` is 2.
    #State: *`path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*', `n` is the length of `path` and is greater than 0, `dp` is a list of zeros with length `n`.

    #State: `dp` is a list where each element is either `-inf` or a positive integer. The value of `dp[i]` for `i >= 2` is determined by the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`, plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@'. If `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is `-inf`. The initial values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` remain unchanged.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp` that is greater than `-inf`. This value is a positive integer, as `dp[i]` for `i >= 2` is either `-inf` or a positive integer, and the initial values of `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` are also either `-inf` or positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of strings `path` where each string is either '@' (indicating a sign of the apocalypse) or '*' (indicating an invalid or non-apocalyptic event). It returns 0 if the list is empty or if all elements in the list are invalid (i.e., '*'). Otherwise, it returns the maximum positive integer representing the best possible outcome based on the path, calculated by summing the signs of the apocalypse while avoiding invalid events.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and data is a list of strings containing the input data for all test cases.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is `2 * t + 1`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each `path` in `data` from the second element to the `2 * t`-th element, incrementing by 2.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The loop has printed each element in the `results` list, one by one. The variables `t`, `data`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes a list of strings `data` containing input data for `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. It extracts paths from `data` and applies `func_1` to each path, storing the results in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results` to the standard output. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `data`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged, and the results of the test cases have been printed to the standard output.
