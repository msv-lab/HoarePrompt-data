Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not solve the problem correctly. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to handle a different problem, which seems to involve a path with characters `@` and `*`, and is not related to the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicities of the signs.

### Explanation of the Problem:
The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur strictly after the previous sign. The solution involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, but with a twist: each sign must occur strictly after the previous one, so the year for the i-th sign is the LCM of the first i signs, plus the year of the (i-1)-th sign.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you can use the following approach:
1. For each test case, calculate the cumulative LCM of the periodicities up to the n-th sign.
2. Ensure that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one by adding the previous year to the LCM calculation.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def cumulative_lcm(periods):
    current_year = 0
    for period in periods:
        current_year = lcm(current_year + 1, period)
    return current_year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(cumulative_lcm(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Code:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
2. **Cumulative LCM**: The `cumulative_lcm` function iterates through the list of periodicities, calculating the LCM of the current year (plus one to ensure strict after) and the current period.
3. **Main Function**: The `main` function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

This approach ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous one, and it correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur.
