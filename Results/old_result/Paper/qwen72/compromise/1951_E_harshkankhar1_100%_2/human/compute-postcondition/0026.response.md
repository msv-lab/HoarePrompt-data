Postcondition: ***If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2` if the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true, otherwise `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.***
