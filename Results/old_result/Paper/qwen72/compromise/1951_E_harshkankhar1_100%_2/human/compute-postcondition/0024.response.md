Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **String `s` and Length `n`**: The string `s` and its length `n` are given, and they remain unchanged.
2. **Variable `x`**: 
   - If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character.
   - Otherwise, `x` will remain -1.
   - It is given that `x` is not equal to -1, so `s` must contain at least one character different from `s[0]`.
   - `x` is not equal to 1.
   - `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
3. **Function `func_1(s[x + 1:])`**: This function returns `True` when called with the substring `s[x + 1:]`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `x` is not -1, 1, or `n // 2`.

2. **Substrings**:
   - `s[:x + 2]` is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x + 1`.
   - `s[x + 2:]` is the substring of `s` starting from the character at index `x + 2` to the end.

3. **Output**:
   - The `print` statement will print the substring `s[:x + 2]`, followed by a space, and then the substring `s[x + 2:]`.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose `s = "aaabbbccc"` and `n = 9`.
- The first character different from `s[0]` (which is 'a') is at index 3 (the first 'b').
- Therefore, `x = 3`.
- `s[:x + 2]` is `s[:5]`, which is `"aaabb"`.
- `s[x + 2:]` is `s[5:]`, which is `"bbccc"`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` separated by a space.

Output: **s[:x + 2] ' ' s[x + 2:] (where s[:x + 2] is the substring from the start up to and including the character at index x + 1, and s[x + 2:] is the substring starting from the character at index x + 2 to the end)**

This output is based on the given precondition and the structure of the `print` statement.
