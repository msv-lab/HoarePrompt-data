Let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` is a string.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1.
   - It is given that `x` is not equal to -1.
   - The function `func_1` applied to the substring `s[x + 1:]` returns `False`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The initial state tells us that `x` is not -1, which means there is at least one character in the string `s` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
   - The function `func_1` applied to the substring `s[x + 1:]` returns `False`. This means that the substring starting from the character after the first differing character does not satisfy the condition defined by `func_1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement will always print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1`.

Output: **YES**
