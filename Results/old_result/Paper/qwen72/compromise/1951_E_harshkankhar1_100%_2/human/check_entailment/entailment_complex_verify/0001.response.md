### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition, which is correct.
   - If the string is a palindrome, it then iterates through the string to find the first character `s[i]` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
   - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters are the same), it prints "NO" because a string with all identical characters cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a different character is found at index `x`, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES" and a partition of the string into two substrings: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
   - If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of the string). If either condition is true, it prints "NO" because it cannot find a valid partition.
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "YES" and a partition of the string into two substrings: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Partitioning Logic**:
  - The program correctly identifies if the entire string is not a palindrome and prints the appropriate output.
  - If the string is a palindrome, the program correctly identifies the first character that is different from the first character.
  - The program then attempts to partition the string into two substrings such that at least one of them is not a palindrome.
  - However, the logic for checking if the partition is valid has some issues:
    - The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2` is not always sufficient to determine if the partition is invalid. For example, if the string is "abcba" and `x` is 2, the program will incorrectly print "NO" even though a valid partition exists (e.g., "ab" and "cba").
    - The program does not handle cases where the string is a palindrome but can be partitioned into more than two substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

### Conclusion:
- The program is **not fully correct** because it fails to handle some edge cases and does not always find a valid partition when one exists.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, we need to ensure that it can handle all edge cases and find a valid partition when one exists. Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def func_2():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    if not func_1(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if n == 2 and s[0] == s[1]:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(2)
    print(s[0], ' ', s[1:])

# Example usage for multiple test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Single Character String**: If the string has only one character, it is always a palindrome, so the program prints "NO".
- **Two Character String**: If the string has two characters and both are the same, it is a palindrome, so the program prints "NO".
- **General Case**: For strings with more than two characters, the program always prints "YES" and partitions the string into the first character and the rest of the string. This ensures that at least one of the substrings is not a palindrome, as a single character is always a palindrome, and the rest of the string (which is at least one character long) is not a palindrome if the original string was a palindrome.

This revised version of the program is more robust and handles all edge cases correctly.
