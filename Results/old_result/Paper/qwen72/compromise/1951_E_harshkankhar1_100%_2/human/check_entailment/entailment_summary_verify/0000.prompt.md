You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string `s` from the user input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and has a length `n` (1 <= n <= 10^6). The function checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions by calling another function `func_1`. If `func_1(s)` returns `False`, the function prints 'YES', followed by the integer `1` and the string `s`, and then returns `None`. If `func_1(s)` returns `True`, the function searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character. If all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'NO' and returns without any value. If a different character is found at index `x`, the function further checks `func_1(s[x + 1:])`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, it prints 'YES', followed by the integer `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, it prints 'NO' if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, otherwise it prints 'YES', followed by the integer `2` and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`. In all cases, the function either returns `None` or returns without any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when the string consists of the same character repeated multiple times, and the length of the string is even. For example, consider the input `s = "aa"`. The program will output `NO`, but the correct output should be `YES` followed by a partition like `a a`.

Let's break down the issue:
- The program first checks if the entire string is a non-palindrome. If it is, it prints `YES` and the string itself.
- If the string is a palindrome, it tries to find a non-palindromic substring by looking for the first character that is different from the first character in the string.
- If it finds such a character, it attempts to partition the string into two parts, but it does not always ensure that both parts are non-palindromic.

In the case of `s = "aa"`, the program will not find a different character and will output `NO`, which is incorrect because the string can be partitioned into `a a`, both of which are non-palindromic (since they are single characters).

To fix this, the program should handle the case where the string consists of the same character repeated multiple times and has an even length by splitting it into individual characters.
