You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to `func_2()`. Inside the function, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, and `n` is the length of `s` (1 <= n <= 10^6). `x` is an integer initialized to -1.

If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true. Otherwise, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.
    #State: *If `s` contains any character different from `s[0]` at any position `i` (where `1 <= i < n`), then `x` will be the index of the first such character. Otherwise, `x` will remain -1. The string `s` and the length `n` will remain unchanged. Additionally, `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, then `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]`, and `x` is either 1 or `n // 2` if the condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is true, otherwise `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - The function returns `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`. If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the partition, which is correct.
   - If the string is a palindrome, it then iterates through the string to find the first character `s[i]` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
   - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters are the same), it prints "NO" because a string with all identical characters cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a different character is found, it checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome. If it is not, it prints "YES" and a partition of the string into two substrings: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
   - If the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it further checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2` (where `n` is the length of the string). If either condition is true, it prints "NO" because it cannot find a valid partition.
   - If neither condition is true, it prints "YES" and a partition of the string into two substrings: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Partitioning Logic**:
  - The program correctly identifies if the entire string is not a palindrome and prints the appropriate output.
  - If the string is a palindrome, the program correctly identifies the first character that is different from the first character.
  - The program then attempts to partition the string into two substrings such that at least one of them is not a palindrome.
  - The logic for checking if the partition is valid is mostly correct, but there are some edge cases and potential issues:
    - The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2` is not always sufficient to determine if the partition is invalid. For example, if the string is "abcba" and `x` is 2, the program will incorrectly print "NO" even though a valid partition exists (e.g., "ab" and "cba").
    - The program does not handle cases where the string is a palindrome but can be partitioned into more than two substrings, each of which is not a palindrome.

### Conclusion:
- The program is **not fully correct** because it fails to handle some edge cases and does not always find a valid partition when one exists.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Suggested Fix:
To fix the program, we need to ensure that it can handle all edge cases and find a valid partition when one exists. Here is a revised version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def func_2():
    s = input()
    n = len(s)
    if not func_1(s):
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if n == 2 and s[0] == s[1]:
        print('NO')
        return
    print('YES')
    print(2)
    print(s[0], ' ', s[1:])

# Example usage for multiple test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Single Character String**: If the string has only one character, it is always a palindrome, so the program prints "NO".
- **Two Character String**: If the string has two characters and both are the same, it is a palindrome, so the program prints "NO".
- **General Case**: For strings with more than two characters, the program always prints "YES" and partitions the string into the first character and the rest of the string. This ensures that at least one of the substrings is not a palindrome, as a single character is always a palindrome, and the rest of the string (which is at least one character long) is not a palindrome if the original string was a palindrome.
