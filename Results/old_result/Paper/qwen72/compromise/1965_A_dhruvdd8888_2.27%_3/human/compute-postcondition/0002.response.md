Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ piles[i] ≤ 10^9, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` converts the set of unique strings `nums` into a list of unique integers and then sorts this list in ascending order. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `piles`, `N`) remain unchanged.
