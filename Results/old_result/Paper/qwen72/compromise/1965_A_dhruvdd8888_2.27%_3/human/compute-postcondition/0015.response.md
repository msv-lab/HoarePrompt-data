Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `piles` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ piles[i] ≤ 10^9, `N` is an input integer, `nums` is a sorted list of unique integers with a length greater than 2, and 0 is inserted at the beginning of `nums`, `cd` is the number of consecutive pairs of integers in `nums` starting from the first element (excluding 0) that have a difference of 1, and `cd` is even.**
