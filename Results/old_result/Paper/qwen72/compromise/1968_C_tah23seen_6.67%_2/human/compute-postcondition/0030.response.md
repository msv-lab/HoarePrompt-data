The code snippet `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates the value of `ans[i + 1]` by adding the value of `ans[i]` to it. Let's break down the impact of this code on the program:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, and each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500.
   - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is now equal to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - `ans[1]` is now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`.
   - `ans[n]` is updated to `arr[n-1] + ans[n-1]`.
   - If `ans[n]` is less than `arr[n-1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `arr[n - 1]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[n - 1] + ans[n - 2]`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `ans[i + 1]` is `ans[n - 1]`.
   - `ans[i]` is `ans[n - 2]`.
   - The code `ans[i + 1] += ans[i]` updates `ans[n - 1]` to `ans[n - 1] + ans[n - 2]`.

3. **Updated State**:
   - `ans[n - 1]` is now updated to `arr[n - 1] + ans[n - 1] + ans[n - 2]`.

4. **Final Output State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, and each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500.
   - `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500.
   - `ans` is a list of `n` zeros.
   - `ans[0]` is now equal to `arr[0] + 1`.
   - `ans[1]` is now equal to `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`.
   - `ans[n - 1]` is now updated to `arr[n - 1] + ans[n - 1] + ans[n - 2]`.
   - If `ans[n - 1]` is less than `arr[n - 1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `arr[n - 1]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[n - 1] + ans[n - 2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 500, and each element `x_i` in `arr` satisfies 1 <= `x_i` <= 500; `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 500; `ans` is a list of `n` zeros; `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`; `ans[1]` is `arr[0] + (arr[0] + 1)`; `ans[n - 1]` is now `arr[n - 1] + ans[n - 1] + ans[n - 2]`; if `ans[n - 1]` is less than `arr[n - 1]`, then `ans[1]` is updated to the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[1]` that can be expressed as a sum of `arr[0] + 1` added multiple times to `3 * arr[0] + 2`; `i` is `n - 2`; `arr[n - 1]` must be greater than or equal to `arr[n - 1] + ans[n - 2]`.**
