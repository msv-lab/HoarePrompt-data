Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i]` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `arr[i]` that can be expressed as a sum of `ans[0]` added multiple times to the cumulative sum of `ans[0]` and `arr[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `i-1`. The last element `ans[-1]` is `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.**
