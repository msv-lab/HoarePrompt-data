Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the edge case where the input array `arr` contains values that could cause the `ans` array to exceed the specified limit of \(10^9\). Specifically, the logic in the loop where `ans[i + 1]` is incremented by `ans[i]` until it is greater than `arr[i + 1]` can lead to very large values, potentially exceeding \(10^9\).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 500
```
The program will generate the following `ans` array:
```
[501, 501, 1001]
```
Here, `ans[1]` is calculated as `arr[0] + ans[0]` which is `1 + 501 = 502`. However, since `502` is less than `500`, the program will keep adding `501` to `502` until it exceeds `500`, resulting in `1001`. This value exceeds the limit of \(10^9\), making the program incorrect for this case.
