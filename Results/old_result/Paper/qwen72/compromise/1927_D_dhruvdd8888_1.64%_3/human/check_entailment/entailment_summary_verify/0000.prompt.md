You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads from standard input and processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1,000,000). The number of queries `q` for each test case is an integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 200,000). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The function processes the array to identify contiguous ranges of repeated elements and stores these ranges in a list `arr`. For each query, it determines and prints a pair of indices that represent the boundaries of the next or previous range of repeated elements relative to the given range `[l, r]`. If no such range exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for finding the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i \ne a_j` within the given query range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

In the third query, the program should output `1 3` because `a_1 = 1` and `a_3 = 2`, which are different and within the range `[1, 3]`. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1 -1`.

The issue lies in the logic that determines the indices `i` and `j`. The program uses a binary search to find the first and last occurrences of a number in the array, but it does not correctly handle cases where the range `[l, r]` contains different numbers. The program should check for the presence of at least two different numbers within the range `[l, r]` and output their indices if they exist.
