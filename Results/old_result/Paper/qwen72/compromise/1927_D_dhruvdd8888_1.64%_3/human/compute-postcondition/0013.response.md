Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a range in the `nums` list and the value that was repeated in that range. `s` is the index of the last element in the `nums` list. `e` is 0. `num` is the last element in the `nums` list, which is `-1`. `LA` is the length of `arr` minus 1. If `ppp` is equal to 23, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
