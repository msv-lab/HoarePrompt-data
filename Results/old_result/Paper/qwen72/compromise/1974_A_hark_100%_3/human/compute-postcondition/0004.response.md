Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `ap` from the user, which determines the number of iterations. In each iteration, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99) from the user. Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it calculates and prints a value. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it performs a calculation involving `x` and `y` and prints the result. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints the ceiling of `y / 2`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints the ceiling of `x / 15`. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `ap` remains unchanged, and the values of `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration but are not retained outside the loop. **
