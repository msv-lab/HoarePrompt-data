### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `ap`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
     - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is because each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.
     - It then calculates the remaining space on the screens used by the 2x2 icons and subtracts the space occupied by these icons from the total space available on those screens. The formula used is `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
     - Finally, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens needed for the 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.

3. **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.**
   - The program directly calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

4. **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.**
   - The program directly calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

5. **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0.**
   - The program prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons:**
  - The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)` to correctly account for the space used by the 2x2 icons on the screens.
  - The current formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` can lead to negative values for `x`, which is not logical for the number of remaining icons.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)

func_1()
```

### Correctness:
- **False** (The original program has a logical error in the calculation for the remaining 1x1 icons.)

### Explanation:
- The original program incorrectly calculates the remaining space for 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The corrected formula ensures that the space used by the 2x2 icons is properly subtracted from the total space available on the screens. This ensures that the program correctly determines the minimum number of screens needed for all icons.
