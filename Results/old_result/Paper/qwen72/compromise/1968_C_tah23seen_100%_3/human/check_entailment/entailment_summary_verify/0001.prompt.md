You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` of length `n` where each element from `ans[0]` to `ans[n-2]` is the difference between the next element in `ans` and the corresponding element in `arr`. The last element of `ans` remains unchanged, initialized to `10

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` which contains the values `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\). This is a valid choice because \(10^9\) is within the allowed range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

3. **Backward Construction:**
   - The function then iterates backward from `i = n - 2` to `i = 0` to construct the array `ans`.
   - For each `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This is intended to satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

4. **Modulo Condition:**
   - The condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i\) for some integer \(k\).
   - The program sets \(a_i\) to \(a_{i+1} - x_i\), which is a valid way to ensure that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) if \(a_{i+1}\) is sufficiently large and \(a_{i+1} - x_i\) is positive.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program ensures that \(a_i\) is always positive by starting with \(a_n = 10^9\) and decrementing by values that are at most 500 (since \(1 \le x_i \le 500\)).
   - This guarantees that \(a_i\) will always be within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, which is the required output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound, and the constraints are respected.

### Correctness:
**True**
