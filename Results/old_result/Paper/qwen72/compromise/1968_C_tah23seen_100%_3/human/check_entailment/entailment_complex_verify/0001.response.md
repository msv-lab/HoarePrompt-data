### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` which contains the values `x_2, x_3, ..., x_n`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\). This is a valid choice because \(10^9\) is within the allowed range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\).

3. **Backward Construction:**
   - The function then iterates backward from `i = n - 2` to `i = 0` to construct the array `ans`.
   - For each `i`, it sets `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. This is intended to satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

4. **Modulo Condition:**
   - The condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i\) for some integer \(k\).
   - The program sets \(a_i\) to \(a_{i+1} - x_i\), which is a valid way to ensure that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) if \(a_{i+1}\) is sufficiently large and \(a_{i+1} - x_i\) is positive.
   - However, the program does not guarantee that \(a_i\) will always be positive. If \(a_{i+1} - x_i\) becomes negative, the modulo condition will not be satisfied.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program ensures that \(a_i\) is always positive by starting with \(a_n = 10^9\) and decrementing by values that are at most 500 (since \(1 \le x_i \le 500\)).
   - This guarantees that \(a_i\) will always be within the range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for the given constraints.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `ans` for each test case, which is the required output.

### Detailed Analysis of the Backward Construction:
- The key point to verify is whether the expression `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` always results in a positive value for `ans[i]`.
- Given that `ans[i + 1]` is initialized to \(10^9\) and `arr[i]` is at most 500, the expression `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` will always be positive (since \(10^9 - 500 > 0\)).
- Therefore, the program ensures that \(a_i\) is always positive and within the allowed range.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound, and the constraints are respected.

### Correctness:
**True**
