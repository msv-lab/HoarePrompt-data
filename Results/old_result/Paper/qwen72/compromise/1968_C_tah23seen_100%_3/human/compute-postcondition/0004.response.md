Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where 1 <= arr[i] <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, `i` is `n - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is decremented by 1, so `i` is now `n - 3`.
- The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `arr` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 500 for all indices from 2 to `n` is still valid.
- The condition that `n` is an integer between 2 and 500 is still valid.
- The condition that `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is 1000000000 except `ans[i]` which is `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` is still valid, but now `i` is `n - 3`.
