To determine what will be printed by the `print(len(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the list `ans`.

### Initial State:
- `t` must be at least 1.
- `tc` is 0.
- `n` and `k` are input integers.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \).
- `j` is 19.
- The list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` except for `1 << i`.

### Construction of `ans`:
1. **Initial Elements**:
   - The first element is `k - (1 << i)`.
   - The second element is `k + 1`.
   - The third element is `k + 1 + (1 << i)`.

2. **Powers of 2**:
   - All powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` are included.
   - The power `1 << i` is excluded from this list.

### Calculation of the Length of `ans`:
- **Initial Elements**: There are 3 initial elements.
- **Powers of 2**: The powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` are:
  - \( 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots, 1 << 19 \)
  - This sequence has 20 elements (since \( 1 << 19 \) is the 20th power of 2 starting from 0).
- **Exclusion**: One power of 2 (`1 << i`) is excluded.

Thus, the total number of elements in `ans` is:
\[ 3 + (20 - 1) = 3 + 19 = 22 \]

### Final Output:
The `print(len(ans))` statement will print the length of the list `ans`, which is 22.

Output: **22**
