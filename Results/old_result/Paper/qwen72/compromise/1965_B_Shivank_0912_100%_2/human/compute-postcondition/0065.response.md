The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the range limit `20`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `20`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `tc` is 2, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), `j` is 1, `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, and the list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by the powers of 2 from `1 << 1` to `1 << 19`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, the list `ans` additionally includes `1 << j` which is `1`.**
