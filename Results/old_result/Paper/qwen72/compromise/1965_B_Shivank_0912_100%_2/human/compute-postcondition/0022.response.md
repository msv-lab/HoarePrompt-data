Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `i` is the largest integer such that \( 1 << i \leq k \), and `j` is 19. The list `ans` contains the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` followed by all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19` except for `1 << i`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs 20 times, with `j` ranging from 0 to 19.
- For each value of `j`, if `j` is not equal to `i`, the value `1 << j` is appended to the list `ans`.
- Therefore, after 20 iterations, `ans` will contain the initial elements `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` plus all powers of 2 from `1` to `1 << 19`, excluding `1 << i`.
- The variable `j` will be 19 after the loop completes.
- The variables `t`, `tc`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
