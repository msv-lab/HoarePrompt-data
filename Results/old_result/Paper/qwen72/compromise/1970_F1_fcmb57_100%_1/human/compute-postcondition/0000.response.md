Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, where 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd. The code snippet `x, y = a` results in a TypeError because `a` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `x` and `y`. Therefore, `x` and `y` remain undefined.**
