Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in their own goal. According to the problem description, if a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should win a point, and vice versa. However, the program only checks if the player is in a goal and increments the score for the corresponding team without considering whether the goal belongs to the player's own team or the opposing team. This leads to incorrect scoring in such scenarios.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
B2 U
B2 U
B2 L
B2 C .Q
B2 L
B2 L
B2 T
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T
```
In this case, if a red player (R0) scores in a red goal (RG), the blue team should win a point. However, the program will incorrectly increment the red team's score.
