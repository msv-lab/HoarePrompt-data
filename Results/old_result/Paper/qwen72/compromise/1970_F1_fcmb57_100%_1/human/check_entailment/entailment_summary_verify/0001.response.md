### Reasoning:

1. **Field Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It then reads the initial state of the field, which is a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns.
   - The program correctly identifies and stores the positions of players and goals in the `players` and `goals` dictionaries, respectively.
   - The position of the Quaffle is not explicitly stored, but it is assumed to be at the middle of the field when not carried by a player.

2. **Movement Handling:**
   - The program defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map the direction characters ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') to their corresponding coordinate changes.
   - For each move, the program checks if the action is a movement ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and updates the player's position accordingly using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function correctly updates the player's position based on the direction. However, the function summary provided is incorrect. The function `func_1` actually takes a tuple `a` representing the current position and a tuple `b` representing the direction, and returns the new position as a tuple. This is consistent with the code and does not raise a `TypeError`.

3. **Scoring and Goal Handling:**
   - When a player throws the Quaffle ('T'), the program checks if the player is at a goal position.
   - If the player is at a red goal, the blue team scores a point, and vice versa.
   - The program prints the scoring event with the correct time and team.
   - However, the program does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored. This is a critical oversight because the problem description states that the Quaffle should instantly move to the middle of the field after a goal.

4. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all the moves, the program prints the final score in the format `FINAL SCORE: r b`, where `r` is the score of the red team and `b` is the score of the blue team.

5. **Quaffle Handling:**
   - The program does not handle the Quaffle being caught and carried by a player. It only updates the player's position and checks for goals when the player throws the Quaffle.
   - The Quaffle's position should be updated when a player catches it and should be reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issues with the program. The program is **incorrect** because it does not handle the Quaffle's position correctly. Specifically, it does not reset the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, and it does not update the Quaffle's position when a player catches it.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
