### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is either the maximum number of draws or -1 if the scores are inconsistent.

2. **Odd Sum Check**:
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the function prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws can be `p1 + p2` if the third player has a score that is at least the sum of the other two players' scores. This is because all points could have been from draws.
   - **Case 2**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the function enters a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop tries to balance the scores by adjusting `x` and `y`:
     - `x` starts at 0 and `y` starts at `p3`.
     - The loop continues as long as `y >= x`.
     - Inside the loop, it checks if `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If this condition is met, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks the loop.
     - If the condition is not met, it increments `x` and decrements `y` to try the next possible values.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles cases where the scores are inconsistent (e.g., `1 1 10`) correctly by printing `-1`.

5. **Algorithm Validity**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the total points are even and by balancing the scores in the while loop.
   - The while loop ensures that the maximum number of draws is calculated by trying to minimize the difference between the scores of the players.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be logically correct and handles all the given test cases appropriately. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
