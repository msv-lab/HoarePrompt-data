### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

2. **Odd Sum Check:**
   - The function checks if the sum of the scores `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because the total points must be even (since each game results in either 2 points or 1 point for each player in a draw).

3. **Maximum Draws Calculation:**
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the function prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because the maximum number of draws occurs when the two players with the lowest scores have played all their games against each other, and the highest score player has not played any draws.
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the function enters a loop to find the maximum number of draws. The loop iterates while `y` (initially set to `p3`) is greater than or equal to `x` (initially set to `0`).
   - Inside the loop, the function checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks the loop. This condition ensures that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that maximizes draws.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid distribution, the function prints `p3`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles cases where no games were played (`0 0 0`).
   - It also handles cases where the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games (`1 1 1`).

5. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is `0` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `0`.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is `2` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `1` (one draw between the second and third players).
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is `3` (odd), so the function prints `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is `4` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2` (one draw between the first and second players, and one draw between the first and third players).
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is `9` (odd), so the function prints `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `6` (three draws between the first and second players, and three draws between the second and third players).
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is `12` (even), and the maximum number of draws is `2` (one draw between the first and second players, and one draw between the first and third players).

### Correctness:
**True**

The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.
