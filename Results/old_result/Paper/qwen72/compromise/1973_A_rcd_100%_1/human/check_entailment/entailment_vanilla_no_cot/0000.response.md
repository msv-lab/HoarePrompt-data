Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Draws:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the maximum number of draws by using a while loop to adjust the scores. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly account for the total number of games played and the distribution of points.

2. **Logic for Determining Feasibility:**
   - The program checks if the total points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` are even, which is correct because the total points must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss scenario or 2 points in a draw scenario).
   - However, the condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2` is not sufficient to determine the feasibility of the scores. This condition only checks if the highest score can be achieved by the sum of the other two scores, but it does not ensure that the scores can be distributed correctly among the games.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Draws:**
   - The while loop in the program is intended to find a valid distribution of draws, but it does not correctly handle all possible scenarios. For example, it does not correctly handle cases where the scores are close but not exactly equal.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Ensure the total points are even.
- Check if the scores can be achieved by a valid distribution of wins, losses, and draws.
- Calculate the maximum number of draws by distributing the points in a way that maximizes the number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        # Check if the total points are even
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (total_points // 2) - p3
        
        # Check if the remaining points can be distributed correctly
        if max_draws < 0 or (p2 - max_draws) < 0 or (p1 - max_draws) < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Total Points Check:** The program first checks if the total points are even. If not, it prints `-1` because the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation:** The maximum number of draws is calculated as `(total_points // 2) - p3`. This is because the total points can be split into wins and draws, and the maximum number of draws is the number of points that can be distributed as draws without exceeding the highest score.
- **Feasibility Check:** The program then checks if the remaining points after accounting for the maximum draws can be distributed correctly among the players. If any of the remaining points are negative, it prints `-1`.

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
