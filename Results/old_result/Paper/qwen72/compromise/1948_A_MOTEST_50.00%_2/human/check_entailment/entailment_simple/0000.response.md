### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1, the function correctly prints "NO" because it is impossible to have a string with exactly one special character. A special character must be equal to one of its neighbors, and a single character cannot have a neighbor.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the function constructs a string by repeating each character from `string.ascii_uppercase` (i.e., 'A', 'B', 'C', etc.) twice, until the string has `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is odd and greater than 1, the function starts with the string "AAA" (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to append pairs of characters from `string.ascii_uppercase` until the string has `n` special characters.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the function prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be formed.
   - If `n` is 1, it prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is a requirement of the problem.

6. **General Correctness**:
   - The function correctly constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters for all valid `n` (i.e., `n` > 1).
   - The use of `string.ascii_uppercase` ensures that the string is composed of uppercase Latin letters.
   - The logic for constructing the string is sound and meets the problem's requirements.
