Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice and then `s[2]` repeated twice, `x` is 2, `j` is 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `2` of the string `s` (which is `s[2]`) repeated twice to the existing value of `ans`. The existing value of `ans` is `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `s[0]` repeated twice, `s[1]` repeated twice, and `s[2]` repeated twice. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
