Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer.** 

The code snippet `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to the integer input provided by the user. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions for `x`, `j`, and `ans` will be evaluated based on the new value of `n` after this input.
