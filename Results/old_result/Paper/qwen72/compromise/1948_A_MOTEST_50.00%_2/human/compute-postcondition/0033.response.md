Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer not equal to 1, `x` is `n // 2`, `j` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2` if `n` is odd. If `n` is even, `ans` is a string containing each character of `s` from index 0 to `n // 2 - 1` repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAA' + each character of `s` from index 1 to `n // 2 - 1` repeated twice.***
