Output State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`, `m` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, `s2` is a string containing the third character of `s`, and `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.** 

Explanation: The code `s2 += i` appends the third character of `s` (which is `i`) to `s2`. Since `i` is in `alphabet`, `s2` is updated to include this character. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
