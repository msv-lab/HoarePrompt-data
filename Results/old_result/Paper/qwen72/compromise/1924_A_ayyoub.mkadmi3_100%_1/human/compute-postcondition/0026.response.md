Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets, `i` is the third character of `s`, and `m` is greater than 1. If `len(alphabet) != 1` and `i` is in `alphabet`, `i` is removed from `alphabet`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, and `s2` remains an empty string. If `len(alphabet) != 1` and `i` is not in `alphabet`, all variables remain unchanged. If `len(alphabet) == 1`, `s1` is a string containing the first character of `s` followed by the second character of `s`, and `s2` is a string containing the third character of `s`.***
