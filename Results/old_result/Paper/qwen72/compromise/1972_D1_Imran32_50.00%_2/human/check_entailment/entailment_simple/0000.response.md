Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\)
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to take no arguments, but it should take `n` and `m` as inputs.
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from input, but `k` should be `m` as per the problem statement.

2. **Logic Inside the Function**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to `n`.
   - It then iterates from `2` to `root` (where `root` is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`), and for each `i`, it updates `ans` by adding \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
   - This logic does not correspond to the problem's requirement of finding pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints `ans`, which is not the correct result for the problem.

Given these issues, the program is clearly incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
