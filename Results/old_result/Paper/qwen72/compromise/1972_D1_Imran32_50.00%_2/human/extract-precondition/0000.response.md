Precondition: **The function should take two positive integers n and m as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.** 

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(n, m):
```

This ensures that the function receives the necessary inputs to solve the problem.
