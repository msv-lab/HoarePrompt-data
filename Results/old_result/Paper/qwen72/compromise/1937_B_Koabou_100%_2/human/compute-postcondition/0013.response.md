To determine what will be printed by the `print(t)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` remains unchanged.
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `y` remains unchanged.
   - `t` is either `x - i + 1` if a match is found at index `i`, or 1 if no match is found.
   - `n` remains unchanged.

2. **Explanation:**
   - The value of `t` depends on whether a match is found at index `i`.
   - If a match is found at index `i`, then `t` is calculated as `x - i + 1`.
   - If no match is found, then `t` is set to 1.

Since the exact value of `i` and the conditions under which a match is found are not provided, we can only describe the possible values of `t` based on the given conditions.

- If a match is found at index `i`, then `t` will be `x - i + 1`.
- If no match is found, then `t` will be 1.

Therefore, the output of the `print(t)` statement will be either `x - i + 1` or 1, depending on the match condition.

Output: **t (where t is either `x - i + 1` if a match is found at index `i`, or 1 if no match is found)**
