The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the value `2` in the `range(2)` function. The loop will execute 2 times regardless of the state of other variables, as long as the range is defined with a positive integer. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the objects in the loop head.

However, to ensure that the loop can execute and to provide a clear state, we can state that the loop will execute 2 times, and the variable `_` will start from 0 and increment to 1 during the loop's execution.

State: **`a` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a1` and `a2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's, `_` is 0, and the loop will execute 2 times.**
