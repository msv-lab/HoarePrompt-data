Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the occurrences of the substrings "map", "pie", and "mapie" in the input string `s`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping nature of the substrings and the fact that removing characters to make the string beautiful involves more than just counting these substrings.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie":
- The program counts 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
- The program also counts 0 occurrences of "mapie".
- The program outputs `1 + 1 - 0 = 2`, which is correct in this case.

However, consider the string "mappppie":
- The program counts 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie".
- The program also counts 0 occurrences of "mapie".
- The program outputs `1 + 1 - 0 = 2`, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1, as removing the 'p' between "map" and "pie" would make the string beautiful.

The correct approach should involve identifying the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie" and determining the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring in the final string. This can be done by iterating through the string and keeping track of the positions of these substrings, then calculating the minimum deletions needed to break any occurrences of these substrings.

Correctness: **False**
