Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_7()`, 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n still holds true, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `k` is 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ..., 2^(l-1)].** 

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `i = l-1` (inclusive). For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` initially contains [2, 3], the final state of `ans` will be [2, 3] followed by the powers of 2 from `2^2` to `2^(l-1)`. The values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `l` remain unchanged.
