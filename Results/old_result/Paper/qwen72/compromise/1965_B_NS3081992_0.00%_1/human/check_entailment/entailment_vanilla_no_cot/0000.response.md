Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_14` attempts to construct a sequence based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`, but the logic and the sequence construction are flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Sequence Construction for `k == 1`**:
   - The program returns a sequence `[2, 3]` for `n > 2` when `k == 1`. This is incorrect because the sequence should not have a subsequence that sums to `k` (which is 1), but the sequence `[2, 3]` does not satisfy this condition for all `n > 2`.

2. **Sequence Construction for `k > 1`**:
   - The program constructs a sequence by adding powers of 2 up to `k-1`, then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1`. This approach is not guaranteed to produce a valid sequence that meets the problem's requirements.
   - Specifically, the addition of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` can result in negative numbers or incorrect sums, which violate the problem constraints.

3. **General Logic**:
   - The program does not ensure that there is no subsequence that sums to `k` while ensuring that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence of the sequence.

A correct approach would involve constructing a sequence that avoids any subsequence summing to `k` while ensuring all other values can be formed. One possible correct solution is to use a sequence that includes all numbers from 1 to `n` except `k` and a carefully chosen set of numbers to ensure the sum constraints are met. However, the provided program does not achieve this correctly.
