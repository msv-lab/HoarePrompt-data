### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `func_10()` to read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_14()` to generate the required sequence and prints it.

2. **Function `func_14`:**
   - This function reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It then constructs a sequence `ans` based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, it returns the sequence `1\n2`.
   - If `k == 1` and `n != 2`, it constructs a sequence of powers of 2 from 2 to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k != 1`, it constructs a sequence that includes powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

3. **Sequence Construction:**
   - The sequence construction logic ensures that:
     - No subsequence sums to `k`.
     - All other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence of the sequence.
   - For `k == 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid the sum of 1 and include all other values up to `n`.
   - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid the sum of `k` and include all other values up to `n`.

4. **Output:**
   - The sequence is printed as a space-separated string for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the input and output requirements and constructs the sequence as described in the problem statement. The sequence construction logic ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` and all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence of the sequence.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
