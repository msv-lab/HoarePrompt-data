### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - `func_14` is the main function responsible for generating the sequence `a` for a given `n` and `k`.
   - `func_15` is the function that reads the number of test cases and calls `func_14` for each test case, printing the results.

3. **Function 14 Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:**
     - It reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which splits the input into integers.
   - **Base Case for `k == 1`:**
     - If `k == 1`, it handles the special case where `n == 2` by returning the sequence `[1, 2]`.
     - For other values of `n`, it constructs the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - This sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values up to `n` can be formed by summing the powers of 2.
   - **General Case for `k > 1`:**
     - It constructs the sequence by including powers of 2 up to `k-1`.
     - It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - It adds `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - Finally, it adds the remaining powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

4. **Correctness of the Sequence:**
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
     - The sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing the elements.
     - For `k == 1`, the sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ...]` ensures that no subsequence sums to 1.
     - For `k > 1`, the sequence includes powers of 2 up to `k-1`, and the addition of `k - 1 - sum(ans)` ensures that the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - The elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` further ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
   - **All Other Sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`):**
     - The sequence includes all necessary powers of 2 to form any sum from 1 to `n` except `k`.
     - The additional elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` do not interfere with forming other sums from 1 to `n`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `k == 1` and `n == 2` correctly by returning `[1, 2]`.
   - The function also handles the general case for `k > 1` and ensures the sequence meets the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. The sequence construction logic ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` to be formed.

Final: **True**
