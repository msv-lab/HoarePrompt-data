The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 10, and `i` must start at 10.

State: **`i` is 10, `n` must be greater than or equal to 10, `values` list contains integers from 0 to 9 at the first 10 indices, `sum_values` list contains cumulative sums of integers from 0 to 9 at the first 10 indices, `total` is 45, `numbers` list and `t` remain unchanged**
