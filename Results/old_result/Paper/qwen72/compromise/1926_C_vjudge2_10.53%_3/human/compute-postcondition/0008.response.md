The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range value, which is 10. The loop will execute 10 times regardless of the other variables and lists mentioned in the state, as the range is fixed and does not depend on `n`, `t`, `numbers`, `values`, `sum_values`, or `total`. However, for the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to a value that is within the range specified by `range(10)`. Since `i` is typically initialized to 0 by the `for` loop itself, we do not need to adjust `i`. The loop will execute as long as the range is defined, which it is.

Given this, the state does not need to be adjusted for `i` or the range, but we can restate the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:

State: **`total` is 0, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized to 0, `sum_values` is a list of length `max(numbers) + 1` initialized to 0, and the loop will execute 10 times as `i` is initialized to 0 by the loop.**
