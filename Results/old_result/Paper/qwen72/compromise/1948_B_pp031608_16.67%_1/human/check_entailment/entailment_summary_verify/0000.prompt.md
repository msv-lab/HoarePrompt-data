You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99) and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific case where the program fails is when it needs to apply the operation multiple times to different elements to achieve a sorted array. The program only applies the operation once, and only to the first out-of-order element it encounters. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```

The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted, so it will print `Yes`. However, if the input is:
```
3
4
12 3 55 67
```

The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 55, 67]`, which is sorted, so it will print `Yes`. But if we split `55` into `5` and `5`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 67]`, which is still sorted. However, the program does not consider this and will print `Yes` without further checking, which is incorrect.

Another case where the program fails is when the array is initially unsorted and the operation needs to be applied to multiple elements to achieve a sorted array. For example:
```
3
4
12 3 55 4
```

The program will split `12` into `1` and `2`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 55, 4]`, which is still unsorted. The program will then print `No`, but if we split `55` into `5` and `5`, and then split `4` into `4`, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 4]`, and then `[1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 4]` is still unsorted. The program does not handle this correctly and will print `No` prematurely.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider applying the operation to all elements that are at least 10 and then check if the resulting array is sorted.
