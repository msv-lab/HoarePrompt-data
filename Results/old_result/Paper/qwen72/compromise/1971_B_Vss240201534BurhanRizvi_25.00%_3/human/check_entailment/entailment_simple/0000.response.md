### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is acceptable since it reads input directly using `input()`.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Shuffling the String:**
   - The function uses `random.sample(s, len(s))` to create a shuffled version of the string `s`.
   - This approach ensures that `s2` is a permutation of `s`.

3. **Checking for Validity:**
   - The function checks if `s2` is different from `s` using the condition `if s != s2`.
   - If `s2` is different, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints "No".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For strings of length 1, the function will always print "No" because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
   - For strings with all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa"), the function will also print "No" because all permutations of such a string will be the same as the original string.
   - For strings with at least two different characters, the function will eventually find a valid permutation that is different from the original string.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the problem description: "Yes" or "No" followed by the rearranged string if applicable.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the problem requirements and edge cases.
- The logic is sound and the output format is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
