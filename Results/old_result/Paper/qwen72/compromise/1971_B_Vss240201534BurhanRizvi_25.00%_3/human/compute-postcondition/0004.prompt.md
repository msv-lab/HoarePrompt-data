You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be called multiple times for different test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input provided. For each iteration, a string `s` will be read from the input, and a shuffled version `s2` of `s` will be created. If `s2` is different from `s`, 'Yes' will be printed followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, 'No' will be printed. The variables `s` and `s2` will be updated in each iteration, but the value of `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10. It returns a value based on the input `s`, but the specific return value is not provided in the problem description.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
