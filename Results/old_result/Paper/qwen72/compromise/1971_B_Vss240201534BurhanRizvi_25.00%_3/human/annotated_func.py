#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be called multiple times for different test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the integer input provided. For each iteration, a string `s` will be read from the input, and a shuffled version `s2` of `s` will be created. If `s2` is different from `s`, 'Yes' will be printed followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, 'No' will be printed. The variables `s` and `s2` will be updated in each iteration, but the value of `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input, shuffles the characters of `s` to create a new string `s2`, and checks if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is different, it prints 'Yes' followed by `s2`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input `t` has been processed, and for each of the `t` test cases, a shuffled string has been generated and compared to the original string, with the appropriate message printed for each case.
