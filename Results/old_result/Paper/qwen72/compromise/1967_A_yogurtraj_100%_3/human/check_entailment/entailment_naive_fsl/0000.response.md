Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the maximum score. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the number of subarrays that can be formed after buying the new cards. 

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
The expected output is 15, but the program outputs 16. 

Here's the breakdown:
- Initially, the counts are [6, 1, 8].
- The minimum count is 1, so we can buy up to 4 cards to increase the count of the second type.
- After buying 4 cards, the counts become [6, 5, 8].
- The maximum score should be 15, because we can form 15 subarrays of length 3 that are permutations of [1, 2, 3].

However, the program incorrectly calculates the score as 16, which is not correct. This indicates that the program does not handle this case correctly.
