Postcondition: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `r` is now the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, and `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is less than or equal to `k`.**
