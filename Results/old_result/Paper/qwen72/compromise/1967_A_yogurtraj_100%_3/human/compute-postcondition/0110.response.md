Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`, `y` is 0, and `r` is updated to `a[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `i` is 1.
- The expression `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` evaluates to `2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.
- `k` is updated to `k - 2 * (a[2] - a[1])`.
- `y` is set to 0.
- `r` is updated to `a[1]`.
- All other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`) remain unchanged.
