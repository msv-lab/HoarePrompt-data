Output State: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `y` is `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `n - 1 - i`.
- Given that `i` is 1, `y` becomes `n - 1 - 1`, which simplifies to `n - 2`.
- All other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `rem`, `i`, `k`, `r`) remain unchanged.
