Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, and the values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` are not yet determined.**

Explanation:
- The initial state variables `ii`, `t`, `n`, `k`, and the conditions for `r`, `rem`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a space-separated list of integers from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. This means `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, and it is sorted as per the initial state.
- The values of `r`, `rem`, and `y` are not yet determined because the conditions for their assignment depend on the values of `k` and `n`, which are not specified by the code snippet provided.
