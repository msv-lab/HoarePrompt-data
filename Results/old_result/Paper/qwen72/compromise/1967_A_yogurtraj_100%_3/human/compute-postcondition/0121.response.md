Postcondition: ***`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2. If (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k, then `rem` is `k % 3`, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`, `y` is `n - 3`, and `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `k` is reduced by `3 * (a[3] - a[2])`, and `r` is equal to `a[3]`.***
