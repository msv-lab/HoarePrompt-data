Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the condition ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k) is true.**

Explanation:
- `r` is updated to `a[0] + k // 1`, which simplifies to `a[0] + k`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
