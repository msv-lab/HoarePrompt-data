The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 1, but specifically, `n` must be greater than 2 to ensure `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, `y` is 0 or `n - 2`. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `k` is 0, and `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`. Otherwise, `rem` is 0, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is the third element of `a`.**
