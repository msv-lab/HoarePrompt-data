Output State: **`ii` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `rem` is `k % 3`, `i` is 2, `r` is `a[2] + k // 3`**

Explanation: The code snippet `rem = k % (i + 1)` updates the value of `rem` to `k % 3`, since `i` is 2. The other variables (`ii`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
