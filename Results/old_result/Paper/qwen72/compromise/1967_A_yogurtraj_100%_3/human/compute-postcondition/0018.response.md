The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 (so `n - 1` is greater than 0).

State: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `rem` is 0, `i` is 1, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `r` is the second element of `a`, `y` is 0**
