The function `func` accepts no parameters directly in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function will process inputs provided in a context where:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i initially available.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, which involves determining the maximum number of cards that can be purchased with the given number of coins `k` for each type of card, given the initial availability of each type of card in the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list `a` of initial card availabilities. For each test case, it returns the maximum number of cards that can be purchased with the given coins, considering the initial availability of each type of card.**
