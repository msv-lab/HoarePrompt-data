Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is greater than 1, `k` are input integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `r` is the first element of `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the difference between the (i + 1)-th element and the i-th element of `a` multiplied by (i + 1) is less than or equal to `k`.**
