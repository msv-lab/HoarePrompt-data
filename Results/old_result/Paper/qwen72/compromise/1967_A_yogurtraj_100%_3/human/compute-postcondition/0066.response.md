Output State: **`ii` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `r` is the second element of `a` plus 0 // 2, `rem` is 0 % 2, `y` is `n - 2`, `i` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
