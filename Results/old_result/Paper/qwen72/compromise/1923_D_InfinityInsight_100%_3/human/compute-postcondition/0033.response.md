Postcondition: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `a[1] < a[0]`, in which case `ans[1]` is set to 1, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[0]`, and `inx2` is less than `inx`.**
