Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 2, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except `ans[1]` which is set to `i + 1 - inx`. If `a[2] < a[1]`, then `ans[2]` is set to 1. `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[0]`. If `last[0] < inx`, then `inx` is updated to `last[0]` and `inx2` is also `last[0]`. If `inx` is less than 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.**

Explanation:
- `inx` is assigned the result of `func_1(left, x)`.
- The values of `a`, `i`, `last`, `ans`, `left`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The value of `inx2` is still `last[0]`.
- If `last[0] < inx`, then `inx` is updated to `last[0]` and `inx2` is also `last[0]`.
- If `inx` is less than 0, the program continues to the next iteration or statement.
