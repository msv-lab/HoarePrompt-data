Output State: **`a` must be a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1 except `ans[1]` which is 1, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` must be greater than 1, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than the value of `a[i - 1]`.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop. Since no variables are modified by the `continue` statement, the initial state remains unchanged.
