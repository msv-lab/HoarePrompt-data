Output State: **`a` is a non-empty list, `i` is 1, `last` is a list of length `n` where each element is the index of the last occurrence of the corresponding element in `a` up to that index, `ans` remains a list of length `n` with all elements set to -1, except if `a[1] < a[0]`, in which case `ans[1]` is set to 1, `left` is a list with `len(a) + 1` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `a` up to the corresponding index, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is the result of `func_1(left, x)`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for all variables except `inx`.
- `inx` is assigned the result of the function `func_1` when called with `left` and `x` as arguments.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, which is a specific value based on the initial state.
- The function `func_1` is called with `left` and `x`, and the result is stored in `inx`.
- The other variables (`a`, `i`, `last`, `ans`, `left`, `n`) retain their initial values and conditions.
