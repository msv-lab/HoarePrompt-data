To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1. This is the initial value for the loop, and it is correct as per the loop statement.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is already given as a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to run at least once.

The other variables and lists (`a`, `left`, `last`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
