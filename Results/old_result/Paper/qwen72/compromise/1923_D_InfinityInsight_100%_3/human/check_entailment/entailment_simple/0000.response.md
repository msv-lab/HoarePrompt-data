### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes `n` and the list of slime sizes `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to find the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for `x` in the sorted list `a`.
   - If `x` is less than 0, it returns -1, which is not applicable in this context since `x` is always non-negative.
   - If `a[inx]` is equal to `x`, it returns `inx + 1` to account for 0-based indexing.
   - Otherwise, it returns `inx`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, considering only the left-to-right direction.
   - It initializes `left` to store cumulative sums of slime sizes and `last` to store the last index of the same size as the current slime.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to update `last` and `left`.
   - For each slime, it checks if it can be eaten by its left neighbor. If so, it sets `ans[i]` to 1.
   - If the slime cannot be eaten by its left neighbor, it calculates the cumulative sum up to the current slime and uses `func_1` to find the index of the first slime that can potentially eat it.
   - It updates `ans[i]` based on the minimum number of seconds calculated.

4. **Combining Results from Both Directions:**
   - The program calls `func_2` twice: once for the original list `a` and once for the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - It combines the results by taking the minimum of the two values for each slime, unless one of the values is -1, in which case it takes the maximum (i.e., the non-negative value).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which are the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten or -1 if it is impossible.

### Issues:
- **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
  - The cumulative sum list `left` is being updated incorrectly. It should be `left.append(left[-1] + a[i])` instead of `left.append(left[-1] + i)`.
- **Index Calculation:**
  - The index `inx` returned by `func_1` is used to determine the minimum number of seconds, but the logic for updating `ans[i]` might be flawed. Specifically, the condition `if inx2 < inx` and the subsequent update might not always be correct.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from bisect import bisect_left as bl

def func_1(a, x):
    if x < 0:
        return -1
    inx = bl(a, x)
    if inx < len(a) and a[inx] == x:
        return inx + 1
    return inx

def func_2(a, n):
    left = [0]
    last = [-1]
    ans = [-1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] != a[i - 1]:
            last.append(i)
        else:
            last.append(last[-1])
        left.append(left[-1] + a[i])  # Corrected cumulative sum calculation

    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            ans[i] = 1
            continue

        x = left[i] - a[i]
        inx = func_1(left, x)

        inx2 = last[i - 1]

        if inx2 < inx:
            inx = inx2

        if inx < 0:
            continue

        ans[i] = i + 1 - inx

    return ans

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = func_2(a, n)
    ans2 = func_2(a[::-1], n)
    ans2 = ans2[::-1]
    for i in range(n):
        if ans[i] == -1 or ans2[i] == -1:
            ans[i] = max(ans[i], ans2[i])
        else:
            ans[i] = min(ans[i], ans2[i])
    print(*ans)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the original program is used without corrections.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has issues with the cumulative sum calculation and the index logic, which need to be corrected for the program to work as intended.
