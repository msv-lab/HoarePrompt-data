t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of slimes. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the sizes of the slimes. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
