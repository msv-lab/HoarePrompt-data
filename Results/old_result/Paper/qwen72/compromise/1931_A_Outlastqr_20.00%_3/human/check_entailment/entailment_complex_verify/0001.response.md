Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to find the lexicographically smallest word of 3 lowercase Latin letters that sums up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the three letters should equal `n`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
   - The output should be the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word for each test case.

3. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program uses a predefined string `alphabet` which contains all lowercase Latin letters.
   - It processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.
   - Depending on the value of `n`, it constructs the word:
     - If `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
     - If `n > 26`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
     - If `n ≤ 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

4. **Verification of the Approach**:
   - **Case 1: n > 52**:
     - The maximum sum of two letters is 26 + 26 = 52.
     - If `n > 52`, the third letter must be 'z' (26) and the second letter must also be 'z' (26).
     - The first letter is then `alphabet[n - 53]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first letter is the smallest possible, and the other two are 'z'.
     - **Example**: For `n = 78`, the word is 'zzz' (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).

   - **Case 2: 26 < n ≤ 52**:
     - The maximum sum of one letter is 26.
     - If `n > 26`, the third letter must be 'z' (26).
     - The first letter is 'a' (1), and the second letter is `alphabet[n - 28]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first letter is 'a', and the second letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.
     - **Example**: For `n = 52`, the word is 'az' (1 + 26 + 25 = 52).

   - **Case 3: n ≤ 26**:
     - If `n ≤ 26`, the word can be constructed with the first two letters as 'a' (1 + 1 = 2).
     - The third letter is `alphabet[n - 3]`.
     - This ensures the word is lexicographically smallest because the first two letters are 'a', and the third letter is the smallest possible to make the sum `n`.
     - **Example**: For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa' (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
     - For `n = 78`, the word is 'zzz' (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each given `n` based on the logic described.
   - The logic covers all possible ranges of `n` and ensures the smallest possible letters are used.
   - The program does not modify the `alphabet` string or the variables `t` and `n` after their initial assignment, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

However, there is a small issue in the logic for the second case:
   - **Case 2: 26 < n ≤ 52**:
     - The correct approach should be to find the smallest possible second letter such that the sum of the first letter (which is 'a') and the second letter, plus the third letter (which is 'z'), equals `n`.
     - The current implementation constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`, which is incorrect because it should be `'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z'`.

   - **Corrected Case 2**:
     - If `n > 26`, the word should be constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 27] + 'z'`.
     - **Example**: For `n = 52`, the word should be 'ayz' (1 + 25 + 26 = 52).

Given this correction, the program is not entirely correct as it fails to handle the second case properly.

Final: **False**
