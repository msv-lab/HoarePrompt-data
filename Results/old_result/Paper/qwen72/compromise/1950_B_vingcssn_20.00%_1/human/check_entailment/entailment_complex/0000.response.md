Reasoning:  
The program is designed to print a 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern based on the value of `n` provided for each test case. However, the program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4) and prints a fixed pattern for each of these cases. For values of `n` outside this range, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. This is incorrect because the problem description requires the program to handle any `n` within the range 1 to 20, not just the specific cases of 1, 2, 3, and 4. Additionally, the program does not correctly generate the checkerboard pattern for `n` values greater than 4, which is a requirement of the problem.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the problem's requirements for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
