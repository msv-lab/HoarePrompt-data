The code snippet `[n, m] = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into two parts using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns these parts to the variables `n` and `m`. This changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial state to the values provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are strings representing the input values, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`, `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`**. 

Note: The values of `n` and `m` are now strings, and the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
