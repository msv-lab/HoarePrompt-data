Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are integers.
- `min(n, m) >= 2` (the minimum of `n` and `m` is at least 2).
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `T` is 1.
- `ans` is calculated as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.
- `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **Determine `min(n, m)`**:
   - Since `min(n, m) >= 2`, let's denote `min(n, m)` as `k`. Therefore, `k >= 2`.

2. **Calculate `ans`**:
   - `ans` is defined as `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, k + 1))`.
   - This means we need to sum the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` in the range from 2 to `k` (inclusive).

3. **Break down the summation**:
   - For each `b` in the range `2` to `k`:
     - Calculate `(n + b) // (b * b)`.
     - Add this result to the running total.

4. **Summation Example**:
   - Let's assume `k = 3` (since `k >= 2`):
     - For `b = 2`: `(n + 2) // (2 * 2) = (n + 2) // 4`.
     - For `b = 3`: `(n + 3) // (3 * 3) = (n + 3) // 9`.
     - Sum these results: `((n + 2) // 4) + ((n + 3) // 9)`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - `ans = n + ((n + 2) // 4 + (n + 3) // 9 + ... + (n + k) // (k * k))`.

### Final Output:
- The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n` and the summation of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b` in the range from 2 to `k`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, based on the given formula, the output will be the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1)))**
