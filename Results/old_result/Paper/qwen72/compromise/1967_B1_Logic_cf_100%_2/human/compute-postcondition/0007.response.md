The only variables in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `b` and the result of `min(n, m)`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` was 2, and `min(n, m)` was at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `b` must increment by 1 to 3, and `min(n, m)` must still be at least 3.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers converted from their original string representations, `min(n, m) >= 3`, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is equal to `n + (n + b) // (b * b)`, `b` is 3**
