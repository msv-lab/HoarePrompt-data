To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions and variables directly involved in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The variables directly involved in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`.
2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute if the range `range(2, min(n, m) + 1)` contains at least one value. This means `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than 2.
3. **Initial State**: Given `min(n, m) >= 2`, this ensures that `min(n, m) + 1` is at least 3, which means the range will contain at least one value (from 2 to 2 inclusive).

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`b`**: The variable `b` will start at 2.
- **`min(n, m) + 1`**: This must be greater than 2, which is already satisfied by the given condition `min(n, m) >= 2`.

### Final State:
Given the initial state and the loop head, the necessary adjustments are:
- `b` is 2.
- `min(n, m) + 1` must be greater than 2, which is already satisfied by `min(n, m) >= 2`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`n` and `m` are integers representing the input values, `min(n, m) >= 2`, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `b` is 2**
