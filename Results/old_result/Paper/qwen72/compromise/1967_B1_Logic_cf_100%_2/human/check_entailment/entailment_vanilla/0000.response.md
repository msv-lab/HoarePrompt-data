### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
   - Additionally, \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Initial Count:**
   - The program initializes the answer `ans` to \(n\). This is because for \(b = 1\), any \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\) will satisfy the condition since \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

4. **Loop for \(b > 1\):**
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it updates `ans` by adding \((n + b) // (b * b)\).

5. **Analysis of the Condition:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly handled in the program.
   - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(b\).

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - For a given \(b\), we need to count the number of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This requires checking the divisibility condition for each \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\).

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
