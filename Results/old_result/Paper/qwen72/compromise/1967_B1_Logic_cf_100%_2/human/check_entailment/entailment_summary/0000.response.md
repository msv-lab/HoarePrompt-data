Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through possible values of \( b \) from 2 to \( \min(n, m) \) and calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\). However, this approach does not correctly implement the condition that \( a + b \) must be a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).

Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The program uses the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to count the number of valid pairs. This formula does not correctly reflect the condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). The correct approach should involve checking the gcd and ensuring the condition holds for each pair \((a, b)\).

2. **Initialization of `ans`**: The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is incorrect. The initial value of `ans` should be 0 because we are counting the number of valid pairs, and initially, there are no pairs counted.

3. **Range of Iteration**: The iteration range for \( b \) is from 2 to \( \min(n, m) \). This is partially correct, but the logic inside the loop is flawed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
