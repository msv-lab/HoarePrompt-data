You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = c / 2
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        d = c / 2
        
        if a * b < a * d:
            print(a * b)
        else:
            print(round(a * d))
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. For each iteration, the loop takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, calculates `d` as `c / 2`, and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` depending on the condition `a * b < a * d`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated with each input, but their final values after the loop are the ones from the last iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Variable Assignment**:
   - The program assigns `d` as `c / 2`, which is intended to represent the price of one yogurt when buying two yogurts at the promotional price. However, this is incorrect because `c` should be `b` (the promotional price for two yogurts), and `d` should be `b / 2` (the price per yogurt when buying two at the promotional price).

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `if a * b < a * d:` is intended to compare the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotional price.
   - However, the condition is incorrect because it should compare the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotional price, which should be `a * (b / 2)`.

4. **Output**:
   - If the condition is true, it prints `a * b`, which is the cost of buying `a` yogurts at the regular price.
   - If the condition is false, it prints `round(a * d)`, which is the rounded cost of buying `a` yogurts at the promotional price. However, this is also incorrect because it should print the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts, not `a` yogurts.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the cost of buying `n` yogurts using both the regular price and the promotional price.
   - The cost using the regular price is `n * a`.
   - The cost using the promotional price should be calculated by determining how many pairs of yogurts can be bought at the promotional price and the cost of any remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The formula for the promotional cost should be `((n // 2) * b) + ((n % 2) * a)`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it misinterprets the variables and the logic for calculating the minimum cost. It should use the correct variables and logic to determine the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts.
