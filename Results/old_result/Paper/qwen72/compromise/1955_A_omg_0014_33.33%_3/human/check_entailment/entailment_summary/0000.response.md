Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. However, there are a few issues with the program that make it incorrect:

1. **Variable Naming and Usage**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case, but the problem description only specifies `n`, `a`, and `b`. The variable `c` is not used correctly and should be `b` (the promotional price for two yogurts).

2. **Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. The program calculates `d` as `c / 2` and then compares `a * b` with `a * d`. This is incorrect because:
   - `d` should be `b / 2` (the promotional price per yogurt).
   - The comparison should be between the cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price (`n * a`) and the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price plus the remaining yogurts at the regular price.

3. **Correct Calculation**: The correct approach should be:
   - Calculate the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotional price: `pairs = n // 2`.
   - Calculate the cost of buying these pairs: `cost_pairs = pairs * b`.
   - Calculate the number of remaining yogurts: `remaining = n % 2`.
   - Calculate the cost of buying the remaining yogurts at the regular price: `cost_remaining = remaining * a`.
   - The total minimum cost is `cost_pairs + cost_remaining`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
