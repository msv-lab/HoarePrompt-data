Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is the number of iterations the loop has executed. For each iteration, the loop takes three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, calculates `d` as `c / 2`, and prints either `a * b` or `round(a * d)` depending on the condition `a * b < a * d`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated with each input, but their final values after the loop are the ones from the last iteration.**
