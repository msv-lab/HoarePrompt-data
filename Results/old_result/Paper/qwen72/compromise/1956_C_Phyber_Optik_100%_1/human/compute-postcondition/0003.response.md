The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function might internally use or generate values for `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but may internally use or generate values for `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 for each test case. The specific output or return value of the function is not provided.**
