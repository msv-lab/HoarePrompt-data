### Reasoning:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used to calculate the sum is incorrect. The program uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \times i
     \]
   - Simplifying the term inside the sum:
     \[
     i^2 - (i-1)^2 = i^2 - (i^2 - 2i + 1) = 2i - 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \times i
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{sum} = 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i^2 - i)
     \]
   - This formula does not match the correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix, which is:
     \[
     \text{max\_sum} = n \times \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - For \( n = 2 \), the correct maximum sum should be:
     \[
     2 \times \frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2} = 2 \times 3 = 6
     \]
   - However, the program outputs 7, which is incorrect.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program generates operations to fill the matrix, but these operations do not always result in the maximum sum. Specifically, the operations:
     \[
     1 \, n-j+1 \, 1 \, 2 \, \ldots \, n
     \]
     \[
     2 \, n-j+1 \, 1 \, 2 \, \ldots \, n
     \]
   - These operations fill the matrix with the permutation \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\) for each row and column, but this does not necessarily maximize the sum. For example, for \( n = 2 \), the operations:
     \[
     1 \, 2 \, 1 \, 2
     \]
     \[
     2 \, 2 \, 1 \, 2
     \]
     \[
     1 \, 1 \, 1 \, 2
     \]
     \[
     2 \, 1 \, 1 \, 2
     \]
   - Result in the matrix:
     \[
     \begin{bmatrix}
     1 & 2 \\
     1 & 2
     \end{bmatrix}
     \]
   - The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6 \), which is correct, but the program incorrectly calculates the sum as 7.

3. **Correct Operations**:
   - To achieve the maximum sum, the operations should fill the matrix with the maximum possible values. For an \( n \times n \) matrix, the maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\) for each row and column. This ensures that each element in the matrix is the maximum possible value from 1 to \( n \).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly compute the maximum sum for all potential cases, and the operations generated do not always result in the maximum sum. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
