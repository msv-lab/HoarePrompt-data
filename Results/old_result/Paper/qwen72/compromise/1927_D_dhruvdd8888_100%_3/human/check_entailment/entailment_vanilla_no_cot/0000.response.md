Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The program calls `func_1()` inside the loop that iterates over the test cases, but `func_1()` is defined after the loop. This will cause a `NameError` because the function is not defined at the time it is called.

2. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` redefines `input` to be `sys.stdin.readline`, which can cause issues if `input` is used elsewhere in the program. This is not necessary and can be avoided by directly using `sys.stdin.readline`.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Pairs**:
   - The program attempts to group consecutive identical elements and then use binary search to find the boundaries of the groups. However, this approach is overly complex and does not correctly handle all cases.
   - The logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` is flawed. For example, the conditions `if s > l` and `elif e >= r` are not sufficient to handle all possible query ranges.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program appends `-1` to the `nums` array, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results if the last element of `nums` is `-1`.
   - The program does not handle the case where the entire range `[l, r]` contains only identical elements correctly.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not always output the correct format for the indices `i` and `j`. For example, it sometimes prints `s - 1, s` which may not be within the range `[l, r]`.

A simpler and more reliable approach would be to directly check the elements in the given range `[l, r]` for each query to find a pair of different elements. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from bisect import bisect_left

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    idx = 0
    tc = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for ppp in range(tc):
        N = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + N]))
        idx += N
        Q = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            
            found = False
            for i in range(l - 1, r):
                for j in range(i + 1, r):
                    if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                        results.append(f"{i + 1} {j + 1}")
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

func_1()
```

This corrected version reads all input at once and processes each test case and query accordingly. It directly checks for pairs of different elements within the specified range `[l, r]` and outputs the correct indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.
