You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `nums` from the standard input. It processes `nums` to identify segments of consecutive identical integers and stores these segments in a list `arr`, where each segment is represented as a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`. The function then reads a series of queries, each consisting of a pair of integers `(l, r)`, and for each query, it prints a pair of integers representing the indices of the first and last occurrence of a value within the segment `[l, r]` of `nums`. If no such segment exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to keep track of the start and end of segments of the same number.
   - It appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the edge case where the last segment of the same number is not processed.
   - It iterates through the array and constructs a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple represents a segment of the same number. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the number of the segment.
   - The length of `arr` is stored in `LA`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of queries.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries and the number to determine if a valid pair of indices exists:
     - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1 or greater than `r`. If so, it prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints `s-1` and `s`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, it prints `s` and `e+1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Issues:
1. **Segment Construction:**
   - The segment construction logic is correct, but the program appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` which is not necessary and can be misleading. Instead, it should handle the last segment explicitly.

2. **Query Handling:**
   - The logic for handling queries is flawed. The program does not correctly handle all possible cases for finding a valid pair of indices.
   - Specifically, the conditions for checking if a valid pair exists are not comprehensive enough. The program should iterate through the segments to find the first valid pair of indices.

### Corrected Logic:
- The program should iterate through the segments to find the first valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `(l, r)`.
- If no such pair exists, it should print `-1 -1`.

### Correctness:
- The provided program does not correctly handle all possible cases for finding a valid pair of indices. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
