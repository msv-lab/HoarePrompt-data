Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding two different elements within a specified range `[l, r]` of an array `nums` for each query. The approach taken by the program is to first preprocess the array to identify segments of consecutive identical integers and store these segments in a list `arr`. Each segment is represented by a tuple `(start_index, end_index, value)`, which indicates the start and end indices of the segment and the value of the integers in that segment.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called within a loop that iterates `tc` times, but the function itself does not handle the input correctly. The `input` function is redefined within `func_1`, which can lead to confusion and potential bugs. It's better to use a different variable name for the input function.

2. **Segment Identification**: The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical integers and stores them in `arr`. However, the logic for handling queries is flawed.

3. **Query Handling**: The program attempts to use binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment that starts at or after the query's `l` value. This approach is not entirely correct because it does not account for the possibility that the segment might end before `r` or that there might be multiple segments within the query range.

4. **Output Logic**: The output logic is incorrect. The program prints the indices of the first and last occurrence of a value within a segment, but it does not check if these indices are within the query range `[l, r]`. Additionally, the conditions for printing `(-1, -1)` are not correctly implemented.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
