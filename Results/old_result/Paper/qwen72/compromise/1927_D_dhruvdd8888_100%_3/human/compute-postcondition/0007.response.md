Output State: **`N` is assigned the integer value of the input, `nums` is a list of integers read from `sys.stdin` and split by spaces with `-1` appended to it, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`, `arr` is an empty list.**

The value `-1` has been appended to the list `nums`, making it one element longer. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
