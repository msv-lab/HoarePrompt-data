Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the value of the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same number of elements as before, with the last element being `(v, True)`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it, where `u` is the second child of `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, `stack` now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended to it, where `u` is the third child of `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
