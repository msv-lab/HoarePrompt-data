Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains the same elements as before, plus the tuple `(v, True)` at the top, and the tuple `(u, False)` is appended to the top of `stack`. `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 elements, and `u` is the third element in `tree.vertices[v].children`.**

The code appends the tuple `(u, False)` to the top of the `stack`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged. The `stack` now has the tuple `(u, False)` at the very top, followed by the tuple `(v, True)`, and then the rest of the elements that were in the `stack` before the execution of the code.
