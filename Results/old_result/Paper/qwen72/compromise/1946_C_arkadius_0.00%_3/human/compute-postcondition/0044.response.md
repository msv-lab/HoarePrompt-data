Postcondition: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before, and `postorder` is True.**
