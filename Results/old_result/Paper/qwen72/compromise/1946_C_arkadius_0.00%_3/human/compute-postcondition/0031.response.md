Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `v` is equal to `s`, and the loop has processed all children of `v`. The `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its original value plus the sum of `good_components` of all children of `v`. For each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its original value plus the sum of `remaining_size` of all such children.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing, the `good_components` of the vertex `v` (which is equal to `s`) will have been incremented by the `good_components` of each of its children, plus an additional 1 for each child whose `remaining_size` is at least `x`. The `remaining_size` of `v` will have been incremented by the `remaining_size` of each child whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The `stack` and `postorder` variables remain unchanged.
