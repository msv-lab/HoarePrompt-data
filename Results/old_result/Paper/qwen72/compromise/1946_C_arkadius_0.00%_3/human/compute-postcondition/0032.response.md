Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is equal to `s`, and `postorder` is `False`. If `postorder` is `False`, `stack` is updated to contain the tuple `(s, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child of `tree.vertices[s]`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least as many children as the number of iterations the loop executed. If `postorder` is `True`, the loop has processed all children of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is updated to its original value plus the sum of `good_components` of all children of `v`. For each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further increased by 1. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is updated to its original value plus the sum of `remaining_size` of all such children.***
