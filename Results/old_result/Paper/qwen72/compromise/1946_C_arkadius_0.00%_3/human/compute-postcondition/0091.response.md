Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the value of the first element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before and must still contain at least one element, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, and `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`. `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is now equal to its previous value plus `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.**
