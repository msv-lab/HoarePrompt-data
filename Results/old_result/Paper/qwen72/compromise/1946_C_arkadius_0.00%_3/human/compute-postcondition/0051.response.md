Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child vertex, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is now `tree.vertices[v].good_components` + `tree.vertices[u].good_components`. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is incremented by 1. If `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is incremented by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.***
