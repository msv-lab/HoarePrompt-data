The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must still be greater than `i`, which means `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class initialized with `n` nodes, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `u` and `v` are input integers, an edge has been added between nodes `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree`.**
