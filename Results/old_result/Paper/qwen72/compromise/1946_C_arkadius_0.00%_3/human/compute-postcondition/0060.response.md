Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with n vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer, `v` is the first element popped from `stack`, `postorder` is the second element popped from `stack`, `stack` now contains one element fewer than before, `postorder` is True, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three child vertices, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is `tree.vertices[v].good_components` + `tree.vertices[u].good_components`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` + `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**
