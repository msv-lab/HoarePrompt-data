Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be a correct implementation to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of the key components and their roles:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The tree is represented using a class `Tree` (assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code). Each vertex in the tree has attributes `children`, `good_components`, and `remaining_size`.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex `s`.
   - It uses a stack to simulate the traversal, ensuring that each vertex is processed after its children.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function also performs a post-order traversal but in a recursive manner.
   - It calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex `v`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree such that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - It uses `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at vertex 0 (the root).

5. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and satisfy the condition.
   - It uses `func_3` to check the feasibility of each midpoint in the binary search.

6. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and prints the result of `func_4`.

The program follows the correct logic for solving the problem:
- It constructs the tree from the input edges.
- It roots the tree at vertex 0.
- It uses a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that the tree can be split into components of at least `x` vertices by removing exactly `k` edges.
- The traversal functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtrees.

Given that the input and output constraints are respected and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
