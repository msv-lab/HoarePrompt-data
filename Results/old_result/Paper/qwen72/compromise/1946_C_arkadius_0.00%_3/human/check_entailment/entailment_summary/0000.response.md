### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The `Tree` class is used to construct the tree from the input edges.
   - The `add_edge` method adds edges to the tree.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method roots the tree at a specified vertex and calculates the subtree sizes for each node. This is crucial for the subsequent functions to work correctly.

2. **Subtree Analysis:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are both used to analyze the subtrees of the tree. They calculate the number of "good" components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges.
   - `func_1` uses a non-recursive approach, while `func_2` uses a recursive approach. Both functions are designed to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the tree nodes.
   - The `good_components` attribute counts the number of subtrees that have a size of at least `x`.
   - The `remaining_size` attribute sums the sizes of subtrees that are smaller than `x`.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`:**
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the condition in `func_3`.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently.

4. **Main Function:**
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find the maximum `x` for each test case.
   - The result of `func_4` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Functions:

- **`func_1` and `func_2`:**
  - Both functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the tree nodes.
  - They ensure that the tree is analyzed in a way that allows the binary search in `func_4` to work correctly.

- **`func_3`:**
  - This function correctly checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if it is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
  - It uses the results from `func_1` to make this determination.

- **`func_4`:**
  - The binary search is implemented correctly to find the maximum `x`.
  - It uses `func_3` to check the condition for each midpoint in the search range.

- **`func_5`:**
  - This function correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum `x` for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program is designed to solve the problem as described. Each function plays a crucial role in the overall solution, and the binary search ensures that the maximum `x` is found efficiently. The tree construction and rooting, as well as the subtree analysis, are implemented correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.
