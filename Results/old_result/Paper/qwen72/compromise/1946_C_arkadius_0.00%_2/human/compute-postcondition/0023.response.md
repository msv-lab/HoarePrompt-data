Output State: **The program returns `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is the sum of `good_components_subtree` for all children of `v` plus the number of children whose `remaining_size_subtree` is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` is the sum of `remaining_size_subtree` for all children of `v` whose `remaining_size_subtree` is less than `x`.**
