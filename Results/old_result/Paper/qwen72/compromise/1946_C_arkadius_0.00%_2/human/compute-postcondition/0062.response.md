Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is True, `stack` is the stack with the last tuple removed, and for each child `u` of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` has been updated to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].good_components` for all children `u` of `v`. Additionally, for each child `u` of `v` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` has been updated to its initial value plus the sum of `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` for all such children `u`. For each child `u` of `v` where `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is further incremented by 1.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The `good_components` of the vertex `v` (the last vertex in the stack) will be the sum of the `good_components` of all its children, plus one for each child whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`.
- The `remaining_size` of the vertex `v` will be the sum of the `remaining_size` of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.
- The `postorder` value remains True.
- The `stack` remains the same as it was before the loop started, except for the last tuple being removed.
