Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the last boolean value in the stack, `stack` is the stack with the tuple `(v, True)`, `(u, False)`, and `(u, False)` appended at the end, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, `u` is the third child of `v`.**

The stack now contains the tuple `(u, False)` appended again at the end, making it the last element in the stack. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
