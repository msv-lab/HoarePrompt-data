Functionality: ** The function `func_2` takes a `Tree` object `tree`, an integer `v` representing a vertex in the tree, and a positive integer `x`. It returns a tuple `(good_components, remaining_size)`. `good_components` represents the total number of "good" components in the subtree rooted at `v`, where a component is considered "good" if its remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size` represents the total size of the remaining components in the subtree rooted at `v` that are smaller than `x`. The function effectively counts and aggregates these values for the entire subtree rooted at `v`. **
