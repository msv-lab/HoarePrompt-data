The function `func_4` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `n`, and `k`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= k < n`. The function returns the value of `beg`, which is equal to `end`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, a positive integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and a non-negative integer `k` such that `1 <= k < n`. It returns the value of `beg`, which is equal to `end`.**
