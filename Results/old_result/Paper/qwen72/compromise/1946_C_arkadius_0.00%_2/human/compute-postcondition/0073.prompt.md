Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, and `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the last element.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the second-to-last element and `(u, False)` as the last element, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child in `tree.vertices[v].children`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the second-to-last element, `(u, False)` as the third-to-last element, and `(u, False)` as the last element, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, `u` is the second child in `tree.vertices[v].children.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` vertices, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex (1 ≤ s ≤ n), `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component, `v` is the new last vertex in the stack, `postorder` is the new last boolean value in the stack, `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` as the second-to-last element, `(u, False)` as the third-to-last element, and `(u, False)` as the fourth-to-last element, and `(u, False)` as the last element, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three children, `u` is the third child in `tree.vertices[v].children.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
