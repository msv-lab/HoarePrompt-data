Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting**:
   - `func_5` reads the input and constructs the tree using the `Tree` class.
   - It then roots the tree at node 0 using the `root_tree_non_recursive` method. This method correctly sets up the parent and children relationships and calculates the subtree sizes for each node.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that the tree can be split into components where each component has at least `x` nodes after removing `k` edges.
   - The binary search is implemented correctly, with the search range initialized from 1 to `n`.

3. **Component Calculation**:
   - `func_3` checks if the tree can be split into `k` or more components where each component has at least `x` nodes.
   - It uses `func_1` to count the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing the good components.
   - `func_1` processes the tree in a post-order traversal manner, updating the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each node.
   - `func_2` is a recursive version of `func_1` and performs the same task. However, `func_1` is used in the main logic, which is non-recursive and more efficient for large trees.

4. **Output**:
   - `func_5` prints the result of `func_4`, which is the maximum value `x` such that the tree can be split into components with at least `x` nodes after removing `k` edges.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the tree is rooted and the binary search is performed within valid bounds.
   - The input handling and tree construction in `func_5` are consistent with the problem description.

6. **Logical Flow**:
   - The logical flow of the program is correct. It constructs the tree, roots it, and then uses a binary search to find the maximum `x` that satisfies the problem's conditions.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The functions work together to ensure that the tree is processed and the maximum component size is determined accurately.

Correctness: **True**
