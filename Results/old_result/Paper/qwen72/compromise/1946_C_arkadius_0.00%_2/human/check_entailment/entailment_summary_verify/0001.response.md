### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from a tree with \( n \) vertices, and each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program consists of several functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5`.
   - `func_5` is the main function that reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - `func_2` and `func_1` are helper functions to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **`func_5`**:
     - Reads the number of vertices \( n \) and the number of edges to remove \( k \).
     - Constructs the tree using the `Tree` class.
     - Adds edges to the tree.
     - Roots the tree non-recursively.
     - Calls `func_4` to find the maximum \( x \) and prints the result.
     - The function summary provided for `func_5` is incorrect. It states that the function prints the number of nodes at depth \( k \) in the tree, which is not the case. The function actually prints the maximum \( x \) such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices after removing \( k \) edges.

   - **`func_4`**:
     - Performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
     - Uses `func_3` to check if a given \( x \) is valid.
     - Adjusts the search range based on the result of `func_3`.
     - Returns the maximum \( x \).
     - The binary search is a standard approach for finding the maximum \( x \) that satisfies a condition, and it is correctly implemented.

   - **`func_3`**:
     - Uses `func_1` to compute the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - Checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or equal to \( k \) with the remaining size being at least \( x \).
     - Returns `True` if the condition is met, otherwise `False`.
     - This function correctly implements the logic to check the validity of \( x \).

   - **`func_2`**:
     - Recursively computes the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - This function is not used in the final solution, but it seems to be a redundant implementation of the same logic as `func_1`.

   - **`func_1`**:
     - Uses a stack to perform a non-recursive post-order traversal of the tree.
     - Computes the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
     - This function correctly implements the logic to compute the required values.

4. **Tree Class**:
   - The `Tree` class is not provided in the code snippet, but it is assumed to have methods for adding edges and rooting the tree.
   - The `Tree` class should have a structure that allows for the traversal and computation of good components and remaining sizes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum \( x \) is found efficiently.
   - The post-order traversal in `func_1` ensures that the tree is processed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It correctly implements the required logic to find the maximum \( x \) such that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices after removing \( k \) edges. However, the function summary for `func_5` is incorrect, which could lead to confusion. Despite this, the actual implementation of `func_5` is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
