### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Initialization:**
   - The `Tree` class is used to represent the tree, and each vertex is initialized as a `TreeNode` object.
   - The `add_edge` method correctly adds edges to the tree, ensuring that the tree is constructed as specified.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to root the tree at a specified vertex (0 in this case) and compute the subtree sizes and children for each vertex. This method is implemented correctly using a stack to avoid recursion depth issues.

2. **Component Calculation:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are both designed to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex.
   - `func_1` uses a stack to perform a depth-first search (DFS) in a non-recursive manner, which is appropriate for large trees to avoid stack overflow.
   - `func_2` is a recursive version of the same logic, which is less efficient but conceptually similar.
   - Both functions correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex based on the minimum size `x` of the components.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size:**
   - `func_3` checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices.
   - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x` that satisfies the condition. The binary search is implemented correctly, and the `func_3` function is used to validate the mid-point in each iteration.

4. **Input Handling and Output:**
   - `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum component size.
   - The input handling is correct, and the tree is constructed and rooted as expected.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints specified in the problem description, including the number of test cases, the number of vertices, and the number of edges to be removed.
   - The binary search ensures that the maximum possible `x` is found efficiently, and the non-recursive DFS in `func_1` ensures that the program can handle large trees without running into recursion depth issues.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and adheres to the problem description. It constructs the tree, roots it, and uses a binary search to find the maximum component size after removing `k` edges. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree, and `func_3` and `func_4` ensure that the maximum `x` is found.
