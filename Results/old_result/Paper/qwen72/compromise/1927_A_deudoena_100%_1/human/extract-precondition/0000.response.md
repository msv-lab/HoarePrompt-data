Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n, where s consists of characters 'W' or 'B', and at least one cell is black.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer `n` and a string `s` as described in the precondition.
