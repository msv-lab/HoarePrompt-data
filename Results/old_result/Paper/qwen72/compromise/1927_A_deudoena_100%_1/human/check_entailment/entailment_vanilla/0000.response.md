### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the length of the strip `m` and the strip itself `s`.
   - It initializes variables `ma` and `mi` to 0, and `c` and `d` to 0. The list `l` is also initialized but not used in the function.
   - The first loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right to find the position of the first black cell (`'B'`). It increments `c` for each cell and sets `mi` to `c` when it encounters the first black cell.
   - The second loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left to find the position of the last black cell (`'B'`). It increments `d` for each cell and sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` when it encounters the last black cell.
   - The function returns the length of the segment that needs to be painted white, which is calculated as `ma - mi + 2`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The logic of finding the first and last black cells is correct.
   - The segment length is calculated as `ma - mi + 2`, which should actually be `ma - mi + 1` because the segment includes both the first and last black cells.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the strip consists of only one black cell, the program will correctly return 1.
   - If the strip consists of only black cells, the program will correctly return the length of the strip.
   - If the strip has black cells at both ends, the program will correctly return the length of the segment from the first to the last black cell.

5. **Error in Calculation:**
   - The segment length calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect. It should be `ma - mi + 1`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has a minor error in the segment length calculation. It should return `ma - mi + 1` instead of `ma - mi + 2`. This error will cause the program to output an incorrect length for the segment that needs to be painted white.
