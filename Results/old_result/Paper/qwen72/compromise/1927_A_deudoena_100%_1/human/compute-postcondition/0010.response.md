The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it is constrained to the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the length of the string `s`, and it is constrained to the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10. The string `s` consists of characters 'W' or 'B', and it is guaranteed to contain at least one 'B'.

The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, the function returns 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' or 'B'. It returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B' in `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, it returns 2.**
