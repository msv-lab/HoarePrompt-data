Output State: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n, where s consists of characters 'W' or 'B', and at least one cell is black. `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string.**
