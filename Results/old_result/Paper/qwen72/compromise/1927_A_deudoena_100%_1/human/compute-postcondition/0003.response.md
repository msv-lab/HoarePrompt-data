Output State: **`c` is 0, `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `s` is an input string.**

The variables `c` and `d` are both initialized to 0. The other variables `ma`, `mi`, `m`, and `s` remain unchanged from their initial state. `ma` and `mi` are still 0, `m` is still an input integer, and `s` is still an input string.
