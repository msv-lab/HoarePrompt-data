Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and the constraints themselves. The function calculates the count of valid numbers that satisfy the constraints for each test case and prints these counts, one per line. A valid number is defined as one that is between the maximum value of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum value of type 2 constraints (`ax`), inclusive, and is not present in the set of type 3 constraints (`cx`). If `bx` is greater than `ax` for any test case, the function prints 0 for that test case. **
