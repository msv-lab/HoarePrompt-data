You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by a set of constraints. It reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and the constraints themselves. The function calculates the count of valid numbers that satisfy the constraints for each test case and prints these counts, one per line. A valid number is defined as one that is between the maximum value of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum value of type 2 constraints (`ax`), inclusive, and is not present in the set of type 3 constraints (`cx`). If `bx` is greater than `ax` for any test case, the function prints 0 for that test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints for each test case. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Constraint Types**:
   - **Type 1 (k >= x)**: The program updates `bx` to the maximum value of `x` encountered for this type of constraint. This ensures that `k` must be at least `bx`.
   - **Type 2 (k <= x)**: The program updates `ax` to the minimum value of `x` encountered for this type of constraint. This ensures that `k` must be at most `ax`.
   - **Type 3 (k != x)**: The program adds `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures that `k` must not be equal to any value in `cx`.

3. **Range Validation**: After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If this is the case, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no integer `k` can satisfy both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax` if `bx > ax`.

4. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - The program initializes `tmp` to `0` to count the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are in the set `cx`.
   - It iterates through the set `cx` and increments `tmp` for each value in the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - Finally, it appends the result `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` to the result list `r`. This correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` in the range `[bx, ax]` that do not appear in `cx`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, one per line, as required by the problem description.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem. It correctly processes the input, applies the constraints, and outputs the correct number of valid integers `k` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
