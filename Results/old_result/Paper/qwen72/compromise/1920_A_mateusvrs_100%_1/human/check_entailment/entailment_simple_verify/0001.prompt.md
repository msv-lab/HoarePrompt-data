You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `cx` is a set to store the values of `k` that must be avoided (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000000 + 7) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (type 1 constraints).

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the function reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to the maximum of `x` and the current `bx` (ensuring `k` is at least `x`).
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to the minimum of `x` and the current `ax` (ensuring `k` is at most `x`).
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to `x`).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the function checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, there are no valid values for `k`, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.

5. **Counting Valid Values:**
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, the function initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates over the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid values for `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

### Analysis:
- **Type 1 Constraints (k >= x):** The function correctly updates `bx` to the maximum of the given `x` values.
- **Type 2 Constraints (k <= x):** The function correctly updates `ax` to the minimum of the given `x` values.
- **Type 3 Constraints (k != x):** The function correctly adds these values to the set `cx` and later checks if they fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
- **Feasibility Check:** The function correctly checks if the range `[bx, ax]` is valid (i.e., `bx` <= `ax`).
- **Counting Valid Values:** The function correctly counts the number of valid values for `k` by subtracting the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range from the total number of integers in the range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle all the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers `k` for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
