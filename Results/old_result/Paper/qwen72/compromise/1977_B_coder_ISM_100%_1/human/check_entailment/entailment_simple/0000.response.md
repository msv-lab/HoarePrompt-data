Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, reading the value of `x` for each case.

2. **Binary Representation**: The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s` where each element is either '1' or '0' depending on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set.

3. **Transformation Logic**:
   - The program iterates through the binary representation to ensure no two consecutive non-zero values exist.
   - If a '1' is found and the next bit is also '1', it changes the current bit to '-1' and sets a flag to indicate that the next bit should be adjusted.
   - The flag is used to propagate the carry through the list, ensuring that no two consecutive non-zero values remain.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - If the flag is set at the end of the loop, the program adjusts the last bit or appends an additional '1' to the list to handle the carry.
   - The program also ensures that any '-1' followed by '1' is adjusted to '-1' and '0'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the list `s` and the list itself, which represents the required array.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `x` is a power of 2 or has a single bit set correctly.
   - It also handles cases where `x` is a sum of powers of 2, ensuring the transformation logic is applied correctly.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
