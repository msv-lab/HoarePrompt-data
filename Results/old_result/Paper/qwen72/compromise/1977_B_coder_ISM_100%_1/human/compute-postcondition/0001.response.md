The only variables in the loop head are `nalla` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `nalla` will start at 0 when the loop begins.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0**
