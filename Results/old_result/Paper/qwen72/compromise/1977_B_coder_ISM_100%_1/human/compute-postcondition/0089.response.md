The code snippet `s.append('1')` adds the string `'1'` to the list `s`. The initial state indicates that `s` is an empty list. After executing the code, `s` will contain one element, which is the string `'1'`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `s` is `['1']`, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and the bitwise AND of `x` and `2^i` (which is 1) is non-zero.**
