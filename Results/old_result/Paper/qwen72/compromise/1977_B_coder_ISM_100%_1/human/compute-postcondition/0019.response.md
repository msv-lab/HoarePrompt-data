Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `nalla` is 0, `length` is 30, `i` is 2, and `s` is a list containing three elements. If the bit at position 2 in `x` is set (i.e., 1), then `s` is either `['1', '1', '1']`, `['0', '1', '1']`, `['1', '0', '1']`, or `['0', '0', '1']`. If the bit at position 2 in `x` is not set (i.e., 0), then `s` is either `['1', '1', '0']`, `['0', '1', '0']`, `['1', '0', '0']`, or `['0', '0', '0']`.***
