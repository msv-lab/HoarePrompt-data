Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *After the loop has executed all 30 iterations, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` will be either '1', '0', or '-1', depending on the transformations applied during the loop. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1'. Otherwise, `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` is a list of 31 elements, with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `s[0]` is '-1' and `s[0]` was previously '1', then `s[0]` is now '-1', `s[1]` is '0'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1'. Otherwise, `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` is a list of 31 elements, with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1'. If the condition `s[0] == '-1'` and `s[-1] == '1'` is not met, the list `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `s[0]` is '-1' and `s[1]` is '1', then `s[0]` is set to '-1', `s[1]` is set to '0', and the rest of the elements in `s` remain unchanged. If `s[0]` is not '-1' or `s[1]` is not '1', the list `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `s[3]` is '-1' and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[3]` is set to '-1', `s[2]` is set to '0', and the rest of the elements in `s` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
