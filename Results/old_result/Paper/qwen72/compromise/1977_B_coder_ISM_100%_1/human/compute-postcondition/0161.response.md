Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. If `s[3]` is '-1' and `s[2]` is '1', then `s[3]` is set to '-1', `s[2]` is set to '0', and the rest of the elements in `s` remain unchanged. Otherwise, the list `s` remains unchanged.***
