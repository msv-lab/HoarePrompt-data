Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 elements, each of which is either '1' or '0', representing the binary representation of `x` with the least significant bit first. If `flag` is 1, then `s[0]` is '0'. Otherwise, `flag` remains 0, and `s[0]` is unchanged. In all cases, either `flag` is not 0, or `s[i]` is not equal to `s[i + 1]`, or `s[i]` is not '1'.***
