Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, t is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for nalla in range(t):
    x = int(input())
    s = []
    length = 30
    for i in range(30):
        if x & pow(2, i):
            s.append('1')
        else:
            s.append('0')
    flag = 0
    for i in range(0, 29):
        if flag and s[i] == '0':
            s[i] = '1'
            flag = 0
        if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and s[i] == '1':
            s[i] = '-1'
            flag = 1
        elif flag == 1:
            s[i] = '0'
        else:
            pass
    if flag and s[29] == '0':
        s[29] = '1'
    elif flag:
        s[29] = '0'
        s.append('1')
        length += 1
    for i in range(1, length):
        if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
            s[i] = '0'
            s[i - 1] = '-1'
    print(length)
    print(*s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `length - 1`, `length` is 30 or 31 depending on whether `flag` was set or not, and the list `s` has been fully processed according to the rules specified in the loop. Specifically, any consecutive '1's in the list `s` have been replaced with '-1' followed by '0', and the final state of `s` reflects these changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: After the loop has executed all 30 iterations, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list of 30 elements. Each element in `s` will be either '1', '0', or '-1', depending on the transformations applied during the loop. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is changed to '1'. Otherwise, `flag` is 0, or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `flag` is 1, `length` is 31, `s` is a list of 31 elements, with `s[29]` being '0' and `s[30]` being '1'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `nalla` is `t`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list containing 30 strings, each being either `'1'`, `'0'`, or `'-1'`. After all 29 iterations, any consecutive `'1'` and `'-1'` pairs in the list `s` have been transformed such that the `'-1'` is moved one position to the left and becomes `'0'`, and the `'1'` remains unchanged. This transformation continues until no more such pairs exist. The final state of `s` will reflect these transformations, with the last element (`s[29]`) potentially being modified based on the conditions described in the initial state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
