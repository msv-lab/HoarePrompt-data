Output State: **`i` is `29`, `length` is `30`, `s` is an empty list, `nalla` is `t`, `t` must be greater than `t - 1`, `x` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `length` is explicitly set to `30`.
- Since `i` is initially `length - 1`, and `length` is now `30`, `i` becomes `29`.
- The other variables (`s`, `nalla`, `t`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
