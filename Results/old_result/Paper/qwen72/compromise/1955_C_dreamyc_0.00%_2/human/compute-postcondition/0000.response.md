Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15, and `nums` is a deque of n positive integers where 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9.**

The code converts the list `nums` into a deque, which is a double-ended queue. This change affects the type of `nums`, making it a deque instead of a list. However, the values and the constraints on `n`, `k`, and the elements of `nums` remain the same.
