The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 1, and `x` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0, `k` and `a` are integers provided by the user, `s` is now `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1`, `x` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1**
