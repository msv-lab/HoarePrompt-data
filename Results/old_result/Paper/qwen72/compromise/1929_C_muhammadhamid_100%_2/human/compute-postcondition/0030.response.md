Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `s` is `1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1 + (1 + 1 // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1 + s // (k - 1) + 1`, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `a` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.
