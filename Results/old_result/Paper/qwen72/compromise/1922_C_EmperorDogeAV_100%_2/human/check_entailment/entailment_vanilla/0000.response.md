### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The positions of the cities are stored in a list `cities` and converted to integers.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` with zeros.
   - For each city `i`, it calculates the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - It then determines the closest city by comparing these distances and updates `prog_cities` accordingly.
   - The function returns the list `prog_cities`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for the forward and backward costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum for the forward costs.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum for the backward costs, which is calculated after reversing the `cities` list.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it calculates the minimum cost using the forward prefix sums.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it calculates the minimum cost using the backward prefix sums.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are the same by ensuring `a != b` in the input constraints.
   - The program also handles the edge case where the cities are at the boundaries of the list by setting appropriate initial values for `back` and `forward`.

6. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cost of traveling to the closest city.
   - However, there is a potential issue in the function where the cost is set to `1` if the forward city is closer, and to the absolute distance otherwise. This is not entirely correct because the cost to travel to the closest city should always be `1` if it is unique.

7. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sums are calculated correctly, but the logic in `func_1` needs to be fixed to ensure that the cost to travel to the closest city is always `1`.

8. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the minimum number of coins for each query based on the prefix sums.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program has a logical error in the `func_1` function where it incorrectly sets the cost to the absolute distance instead of always `1` when the forward city is closer. This can lead to incorrect results for the queries.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the cost to travel to the closest city is always `1` if it is unique. Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Always 1 for the closest city
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = 1  # Always 1 for the closest city
    return prog_cities
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for the given problem.
