Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 0 ≤ cities[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    back = -99999999999999999999
    forward = 999999999999999999
    if i > 0:
        back = cities[i - 1]
    if i < n - 1:
        forward = cities[i + 1]
    if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
        prog_cities[i] = 1
    else:
        prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `i` < `n - 1`, then if `i` > 0, `back` is equal to `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is 0, `back` remains -99999999999999999999 and `forward` is equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. `back` is -99999999999999999999, and `forward` is 999999999999999999. If `i` < `n - 1`, then `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`. If the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]` is less than the absolute difference between `cities[i]` and `back`, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is set to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged, and `prog_cities[i]` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 2 or greater than 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. If `i` > 0, `back` is now equal to `cities[i - 1]`. If `i` < `n - 1`, `forward` is now equal to `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged. If `abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back)`, `prog_cities[i]` is now equal to 1. Otherwise, `prog_cities[i]` is now equal to `abs(forward - cities[i])`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
