Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is 1 or greater than 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. `back` is -99999999999999999999, and `forward` is 999999999999999999. If `i` < `n - 1`, then `back` is `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is `cities[i + 1]`. `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain unchanged, and `prog_cities[i]` is not modified.**

In natural language: The code snippet sets the value of `prog_cities[i]` to 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, `back` is still `cities[i - 1]` and `forward` is still `cities[i + 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `back` and `forward` remain -99999999999999999999 and 999999999999999999, respectively, and `prog_cities[i]` is not modified.
