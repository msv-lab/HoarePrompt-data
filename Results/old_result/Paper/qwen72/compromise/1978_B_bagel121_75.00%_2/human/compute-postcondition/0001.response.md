The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly set to any value, as it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the loop's execution. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly relevant to the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration**
