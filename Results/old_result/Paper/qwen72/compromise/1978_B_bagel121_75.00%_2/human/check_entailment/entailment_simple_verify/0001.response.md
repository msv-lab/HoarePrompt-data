### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If this is true, it means selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit. Therefore, it prints `n * a`.
   - This is correct because if `a >= b`, the modified price will never be more profitable than the usual price.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`.
   - This is because the modified price decreases linearly from `b` to `b - k + 1`, and we want to maximize the profit from the modified prices without exceeding the usual price `a`.
   - The formula for the sum of the first `k` modified prices is \(\text{ans} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\), which is the sum of an arithmetic series.
   - This formula is correct and efficiently calculates the profit from the first `k` buns.

4. **Remaining Buns:**
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - This is straightforward and correct.

5. **Total Profit:**
   - The total profit is the sum of the profit from the first `k` buns and the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns, which is `ans + p2`.
   - This is correct and ensures that the total profit is accurately calculated.

### Verification with Annotated Code:

- **Case 1: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)**
  - Since \( a < b \), the optimal `k` is \( \min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2 \).
  - Profit from the first 2 buns: \(\frac{(5 + (5 - 2 + 1))}{2} \times 2 = \frac{9}{2} \times 2 = 9\).
  - Profit from the remaining 2 buns: \((4 - 2) \times 4 = 2 \times 4 = 8\).
  - Total profit: \(9 + 8 = 17\).
  - **Correct**.

- **Case 2: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)**
  - Since \( a < b \), the optimal `k` is \( \min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5 \).
  - Profit from the first 5 buns: \(\frac{(9 + (9 - 5 + 1))}{2} \times 5 = \frac{14}{2} \times 5 = 35\).
  - Profit from the remaining 0 buns: \(0\).
  - Total profit: \(35\).
  - **Correct**.

- **Case 3: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)**
  - Since \( a \ge b \), the profit is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).
  - **Correct**.

- **Case 4: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)**
  - Since \( a < b \), the optimal `k` is \( \min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5 \).
  - Profit from the first 5 buns: \(\frac{(11 + (11 - 5 + 1))}{2} \times 5 = \frac{17}{2} \times 5 = 42.5\).
  - Since the profit must be an integer, the program correctly uses integer division: \(\text{ans} = 42\).
  - Profit from the remaining 0 buns: \(0\).
  - Total profit: \(42 + 3 = 45\).
  - **Correct**.

- **Case 5: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000 \)**
  - Since \( a \ge b \), the profit is \(1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000\).
  - **Correct**.

- **Case 6: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1 \)**
  - Since \( a \ge b \), the profit is \(1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000\).
  - **Correct**.

- **Case 7: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)**
  - Since \( a < b \), the optimal `k` is \( \min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000 \).
  - Profit from the first 1000 buns: \(\frac{(1000 + (1000 - 1000 + 1))}{2} \times 1000 = \frac{1001}{2} \times 1000 = 500500\).
  - Profit from the remaining 0 buns: \(0\).
  - Total profit: \(500500\).
  - **Correct**.
