You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing `t` iterations. For each iteration, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` were read from input, and the corresponding result was printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not retained after each iteration, and their final values are undefined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates a value `ans` based on the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, and prints the sum of `ans` and `(n - k) * a`, where `k` is the calculated minimum value. After processing all test cases, the function does not retain any of the input variables, and their final values are undefined. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`. If this is true, it means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` will yield the maximum profit. Therefore, it prints `n * a`.

3. **Optimal `k` Calculation:**
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price. The optimal `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This is because the modified price decreases linearly from `b` to `b - k + 1`, and the usual price `a` should not be exceeded.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \(\text{ans} = \frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k\).

4. **Remaining Buns:**
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.

5. **Total Profit:**
   - The total profit is the sum of the profit from the first `k` buns and the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns, which is `ans + p2`.

### Verification:

- **Case 1: \( n = 4, a = 4, b = 5 \)**
  - Since \( a < b \), the optimal `k` is \( \min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 2 \).
  - Profit from the first 2 buns: \(\frac{(5 + (5 - 2 + 1))}{2} \times 2 = \frac{9}{2} \times 2 = 9\).
  - Profit from the remaining 2 buns: \((4 - 2) \times 4 = 2 \times 4 = 8\).
  - Total profit: \(9 + 8 = 17\).

- **Case 2: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 9 \)**
  - Since \( a < b \), the optimal `k` is \( \min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5 \).
  - Profit from the first 5 buns: \(\frac{(9 + (9 - 5 + 1))}{2} \times 5 = \frac{14}{2} \times 5 = 35\).
  - Profit from the remaining 0 buns: \(0\).
  - Total profit: \(35\).

- **Case 3: \( n = 10, a = 10, b = 5 \)**
  - Since \( a \ge b \), the profit is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

- **Case 4: \( n = 5, a = 5, b = 11 \)**
  - Since \( a < b \), the optimal `k` is \( \min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5 \).
  - Profit from the first 5 buns: \(\frac{(11 + (11 - 5 + 1))}{2} \times 5 = \frac{17}{2} \times 5 = 42.5\).
  - Since the profit must be an integer, the program correctly uses integer division: \(\text{ans} = 42\).
  - Profit from the remaining 0 buns: \(0\).
  - Total profit: \(42 + 3 = 45\).

- **Case 5: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1000000000 \)**
  - Since \( a \ge b \), the profit is \(1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000\).

- **Case 6: \( n = 1000000000, a = 1000000000, b = 1 \)**
  - Since \( a \ge b \), the profit is \(1000000000 \times 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000\).

- **Case 7: \( n = 1000, a = 1, b = 1000 \)**
  - Since \( a < b \), the optimal `k` is \( \min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000 \).
  - Profit from the first 1000 buns: \(\frac{(1000 + (1000 - 1000 + 1))}{2} \times 1000 = \frac{1001}{2} \times 1000 = 500500\).
  - Profit from the remaining 0 buns: \(0\).
  - Total profit: \(500500\).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
