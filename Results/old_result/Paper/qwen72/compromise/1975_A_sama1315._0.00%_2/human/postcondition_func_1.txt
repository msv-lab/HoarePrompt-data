The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of data, and applies a function `func_1` to each set. It then prints the results of these function calls, each on a new line. The function does not return any value. The input is expected to be formatted such that the first value is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` sets of data, where each set starts with an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) representing the number of integers in the subsequent list `arr`. After the function concludes, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the last processed integer, `arr` is the last processed list of integers, `input` is still a reference to `sys.stdin.read`, `data` is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is the position after the last element used in `data`, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(arr)` for each test case.
