### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires checking if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing a specific operation: splitting the array into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
   - The operation can be performed any number of times, including zero times.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it returns 'No'.
   - However, the function does not consider the possibility of sorting the array by performing the swap operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly splits the input into the number of test cases `t`, the length of each array `n`, and the elements of each array `arr`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not check if the array can be sorted by performing the swap operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted.
   - For example, the array `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]` can be sorted by performing the swap operation twice, but `func_1` will return 'No' because it is not already sorted.

5. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` is correct in terms of reading input and processing multiple test cases.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall correctness of the program is affected.

### Conclusion:
- The program is incorrect because `func_1` does not implement the required logic to check if the array can be sorted by performing the swap operation.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
