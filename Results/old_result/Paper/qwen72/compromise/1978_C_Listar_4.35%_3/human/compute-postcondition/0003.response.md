Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

The return statement provided in the code snippet does not specify any variable or value to return, so the program returns nothing. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this return statement, and their initial values remain as assigned by `func_2()`. However, since the return statement is empty, no value is returned from the program.
