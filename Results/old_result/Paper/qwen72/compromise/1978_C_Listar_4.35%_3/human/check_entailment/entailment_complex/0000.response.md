### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_4()` for each one. This is a standard way to handle multiple test cases in competitive programming.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from user input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`:
     - If `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - If `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - It then checks if `k` is greater than `max_k`. If `k` is greater, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating that no valid permutation exists.
   - If `k` is even and within the valid range, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `n` and `k` as parameters and attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - It then iterates over the list in reverse order, moving the last element to a new position based on the value of `k`:
     - If `1 + i > k`, it moves the last element to the position `-k` in the list.
     - Otherwise, it moves the last element to the beginning of the list and updates `k`.
   - The function returns the modified list `l` when `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function takes a list `l` representing a permutation and prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list separated by spaces.
   - It then prints an empty line.
   - The function does not modify the list `l` and returns `None`.

5. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function is the main function that processes each test case.
   - It calls `func_2()` to get `n` and `k`. If `func_2()` returns `(0, 0)`, it prints "NO" and terminates.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - It then calls `func_3(l)` to print the permutation if it exists.

### Analysis:
- **Function `func_2`** correctly filters out invalid cases where `k` is odd or greater than the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
- **Function `func_1`** attempts to construct a permutation by moving elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value. The logic of moving the last element to a new position based on the value of `k` is correct, but it might not always generate the correct permutation. For example, the function might not handle cases where `k` is very large or where the permutation needs more complex rearrangements.
- **Function `func_3`** correctly prints the permutation if it exists.
- **Function `func_4`** correctly orchestrates the calls to `func_2`, `func_1`, and `func_3` and handles the output based on the results.

### Conclusion:
The program is **not** guaranteed to be correct in all cases because `func_1` might not always generate a valid permutation with the desired Manhattan value, especially for large values of `k`. The logic in `func_1` is not sufficient to handle all possible cases where the permutation needs to be rearranged in a more complex manner.

### Correctness:
**False**
