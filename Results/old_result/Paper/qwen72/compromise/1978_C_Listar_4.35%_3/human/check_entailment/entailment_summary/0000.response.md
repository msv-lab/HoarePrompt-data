### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from input and performs initial checks.
   - If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation of length `n` is always even (as each term in the sum \(|p_i - i|\) is an integer, and the sum of integers is even).
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value `max_k` for a permutation of length `n`:
     - For odd `n`, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`.
     - For even `n`, `max_k = n^2 // 2`.
   - If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because no permutation can achieve a higher Manhattan value.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates from the end of the list to the beginning, moving the last element to a new position based on the value of `k`.
   - If `k` becomes 0 at any point, it returns the list `l` as the permutation.
   - If `1 + i > k` for any iteration, it moves the last element to the position `-k` in the list and returns `l`.
   - Otherwise, it moves the last element to the beginning of the list and updates `k`.
   - The function ensures that the final value of `k` is 0, which means the generated permutation has the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function prints the result of the permutation.
   - If a valid permutation is found, it prints "YES" followed by the permutation.
   - It does not modify the list `l`.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function orchestrates the process for each test case.
   - It calls `func_2` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_3` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling**: `func_2` correctly handles the input and checks if `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given `n`.
- **Permutation Generation**: `func_1` generates a permutation with the desired Manhattan value by manipulating the list `l` and ensuring `k` becomes 0.
- **Output**: `func_3` correctly prints the result in the required format.
- **Test Case Handling**: `func_4` correctly processes each test case by calling the other functions in the appropriate order.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem requirements, including input validation, permutation generation, and output formatting. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
