You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #State: The list `l` is modified such that the last element is moved to the position `-k` (if `1 + i > k`) or to the beginning of the list (if `1 + i <= k`). The loop terminates after the first iteration where `1 + i > k` or when `k` becomes 0. The final value of `k` is 0, and the final value of `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). It returns a modified list `l` that initially contains integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order. The function modifies `l` by moving the last element to a new position based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns `l` immediately. If `1 + i > k` for any iteration, the last element is moved to the position `-k` in the list and the function returns `l`. Otherwise, the last element is moved to the beginning of the list, and `k` is updated. The function continues this process until `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes. The final value of `k` is 0, and the final value of `n` remains unchanged.

        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0.
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even.
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n` squared divided by 2.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns 0, 0.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, such that 1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= `k` <= 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to `n` squared divided by 2. Additionally, `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns the integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to n^2 / 2, with `max_k` being greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `1 <= n <= 200,000` and `0 <= k <= 1,000,000,000,000`. If `k` is odd, the function returns `(0, 0)`. If `k` is even, it calculates `max_k` based on the parity of `n`: if `n` is odd, `max_k = (n^2 - 1) // 2`; if `n` is even, `max_k = n^2 // 2`. If `max_k` is less than `k`, the function returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns the original values of `n` and `k`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n, where n is a positive integer.

    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: The list l remains unchanged, and the integers in l are printed in the same order as they appear in the list, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: (an empty line)
    return
    #The program returns None, and the integers in list 'l' are printed in the same order as they appear in the list, separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `l` of integers representing a permutation of length `n`, prints "YES" followed by the integers in the list in the same order, separated by spaces, and then prints an empty line. The function returns `None`, and the list `l` remains unchanged.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_4():
    n, k = func_2()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_2()`. The returned values are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12. `n` is not equal to 0.
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It retrieves two non-negative integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_2()`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and terminates. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` as arguments, and then passes the result of `func_1` to `func_3`. The function ultimately has no return value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not always generate a valid permutation that meets the required Manhattan value. For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 6`. The correct output should be a permutation of length 4 with a Manhattan value of 6, such as `[4, 1, 2, 3]`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not produce this permutation and instead returns a permutation that does not meet the required Manhattan value. This indicates that the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all possible cases.
