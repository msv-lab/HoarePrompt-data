The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12). It returns a modified list `l` that initially contains integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order. The function modifies `l` by moving the last element to a new position based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 0 at any point during the loop, the function returns `l` immediately. If `1 + i > k` for any iteration, the last element is moved to the position `-k` in the list and the function returns `l`. Otherwise, the last element is moved to the beginning of the list, and `k` is updated. The function continues this process until `k` becomes 0 or the loop completes. The final value of `k` is 0, and the final value of `n` remains unchanged.
