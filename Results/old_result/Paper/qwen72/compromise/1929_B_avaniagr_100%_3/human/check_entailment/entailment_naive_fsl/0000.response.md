Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when \( k = 4n - 2 \) correctly. According to the problem description, if \( k = 4n - 2 \), the minimum number of cells that need to be colored is \( 2n \). However, the program incorrectly returns \( 2n \) for \( k = 4n - 3 \) and \( 2n \) for \( k = 4n - 2 \). 

For example, consider the input \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \):
- The program should return 6, but it returns 5.

This is because the condition `elif k == 4 * n - 3:` should be `elif k == 4 * n - 2:` to correctly handle the case where \( k \) is the maximum number of diagonals.
