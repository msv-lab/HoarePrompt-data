The code snippet `ans.append(k - sum(ans))` adds a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is calculated as the difference between `k` and the sum of the current elements in `ans`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **Current State of `ans`:**
   - `ans` contains the value `(1 << i) - 1`, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\).

2. **Sum of `ans`:**
   - The sum of the current elements in `ans` is \((1 << i) - 1\).

3. **New Element Calculation:**
   - The new element to be appended is `k - ((1 << i) - 1)`.

4. **Updated `ans`:**
   - After appending, `ans` will contain two elements: \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\).

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**
