The code snippet `n, k = list(map(int, l1))` unpacks the first two elements of the list `l1` into the variables `n` and `k`, converting them to integers.

- `l1` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input provided by the user.
- The first element of `l1` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`.
- The second element of `l1` is converted to an integer and assigned to `k`.

The variables `t` and `_` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.**
