Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, and `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. If `n` is 1, no changes are made to the variables. If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i`.

Code:
```
l1 = input().split()
```

Step-by-Step Impact:
1. `l1` is updated to the list of strings obtained by splitting the input string on spaces.
2. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `k0`, `ans`, and `temp` remain unchanged unless further code modifies them.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, and if `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n` containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\) and \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros, where `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i < k\), and `temp` is \(2^i\).**
