The code appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to the list `ans`. Here, `i` is the number of times `temp` (the largest power of 2 less than `k`) was doubled before it became greater than or equal to `k`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `ans` is initially an empty list.
- `(1 << i)` shifts the binary representation of 1 left by `i` positions, which is equivalent to multiplying 1 by \(2^i\).
- Subtracting 1 from this value gives us \(2^i - 1\).
- This value is appended to `ans`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `ans` now contains the value \(2^i - 1\).

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the value \(2^i - 1\), `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, and `i` is the number of times `temp` was doubled before it became greater than or equal to `k`.**
