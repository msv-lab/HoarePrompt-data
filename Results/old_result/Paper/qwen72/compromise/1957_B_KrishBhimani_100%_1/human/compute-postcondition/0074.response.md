Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `ans` is a list of length `n`, `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`, `i` is 0, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is now equal to `k`.**

The variable `i` is set to 0, and no other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the value of `i`.
