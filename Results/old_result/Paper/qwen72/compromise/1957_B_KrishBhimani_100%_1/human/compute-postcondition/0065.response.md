Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`.
- `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `l1` is a list of strings from the input.
- If `n` is not 1, `arr` is an empty list.
- `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.
- `k0` is now equal to `k`.
- `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
- `i` is the number of times the loop executed, which is the exponent of 2 in `temp`.
- `ans` is a list containing the values \((1 << i) - 1\), \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\), followed by `n - 2` zeros.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n` and `k`:**
   - `n` is the first element of `l1` converted to an integer.
   - `k` is the second element of `l1` converted to an integer.

2. **Calculate `temp`:**
   - `temp` is the largest power of 2 less than `k`.
   - For example, if `k = 10`, then `temp` would be 8 (since \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\) is greater than 10).

3. **Determine `i`:**
   - `i` is the exponent of 2 in `temp`.
   - For example, if `temp = 8`, then `i = 3` because \(2^3 = 8\).

4. **Construct `ans`:**
   - `ans` is a list containing:
     - \((1 << i) - 1\): This is \(2^i - 1\).
     - \(k - ((1 << i) - 1)\): This is \(k - (2^i - 1)\).
     - Followed by `n - 2` zeros.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume `l1 = ['5', '10']`:
- `n = 5`
- `k = 10`
- `temp = 8` (largest power of 2 less than 10)
- `i = 3` (since \(2^3 = 8\))

Construct `ans`:
- \((1 << 3) - 1 = 7\)
- \(10 - 7 = 3\)
- `n - 2 = 3` zeros

So, `ans = [7, 3, 0, 0, 0]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Output: **7 3 0 0 0**
