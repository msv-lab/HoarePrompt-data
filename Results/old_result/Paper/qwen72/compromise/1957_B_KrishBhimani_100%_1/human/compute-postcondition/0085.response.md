Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1` and is now equal to `k`, `ans` is an empty list, `l1` is a list of strings from the input, `arr` is an empty list, `temp` is 4, `i` is 1, and `temp * 2` is less than `k`.** 

Explanation: The value of `temp` is multiplied by 2, changing its value from 2 to 4. Since the condition `temp * 2` is less than `k` was true before the multiplication, it remains true after the multiplication (as `4 * 2 = 8` is still less than `k`). All other variables remain unchanged.
