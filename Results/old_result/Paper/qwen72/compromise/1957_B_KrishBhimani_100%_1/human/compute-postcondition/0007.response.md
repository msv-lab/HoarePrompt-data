Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the integer value of the first element of `l1`, `k` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`, `n` is not equal to 1, `arr` is an empty list, `k0` is the integer value of the second element of `l1`.**

The value of `k0` is set to the same value as `k`, which is the integer value of the second element of `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
