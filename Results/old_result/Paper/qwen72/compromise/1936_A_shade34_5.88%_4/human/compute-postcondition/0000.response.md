The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder in the loop. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of the sequence `p` and the integer `n` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
