### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a positive integer \( k \) of stones from each nonempty pile. The \( k \) chosen must be at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes the list of pile sizes `a` by:
     - Sorting the unique elements of `a`.
     - Transforming the list such that each element at index `i` (for `i > 0`) is the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in the sorted list.
   - The purpose of this transformation is to reduce the problem to a simpler form where the pile sizes are more manageable. This transformation ensures that the smallest pile in the new list is always 1, and the other piles are the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function determines the winner based on the transformed list `a` and the number of piles `n`.
   - **Base Cases**:
     - If `n == 1`, Alice wins because she can always remove the single pile.
     - If `n == 2`, the winner depends on whether the first pile size is even or odd. If even, Alice wins; if odd, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - For `n > 2`, the function checks if the next player (Bob) can win by recursively calling `func_2` with the remaining piles (`a[1:]`).
     - If Bob can win, Alice must have a move that forces Bob into a losing position. If Bob cannot win, Alice wins.
     - The condition `winNext == 2 or winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1` ensures that Alice can force Bob into a losing position if Bob cannot win or if Bob can win but Alice can make a move that leaves Bob with a pile of size 1.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The transformation in `func_1` simplifies the problem by reducing the pile sizes to a form where the smallest pile is always 1.
   - The recursive function `func_2` correctly handles the base cases and the recursive logic to determine the winner based on the transformed list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n == 1` and `n == 2` correctly.
   - For larger `n`, the recursive logic ensures that the winner is determined based on the optimal play of both players.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description and the provided test cases. The transformation and recursive function are both logically sound and handle all edge cases appropriately.
