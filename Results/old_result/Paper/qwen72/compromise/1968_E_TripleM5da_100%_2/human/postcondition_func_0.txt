The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50) from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3) and prints a series of pairs of integers. The first two pairs are always (1, 1) and (1, 2). For each integer `i` from 3 to `n` (inclusive), it prints the pair (i, i). After all test cases are processed, the function completes and the program returns to its initial state, with no return value.
