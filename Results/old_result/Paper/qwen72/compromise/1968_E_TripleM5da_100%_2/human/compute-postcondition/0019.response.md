The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 4, and `n` must still be at least 4 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4**
