The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which defines the range for the loop. The loop iterates over a range from 0 to the value provided by `int(input())` (exclusive). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`, and `n` must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be reset to 0, and the value of `int(input())` must be greater than `i` (which is now 0). However, since `int(input())` is not a variable that can be adjusted (it is determined by user input), we can only consider the state of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is reset to 0.
- The value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
