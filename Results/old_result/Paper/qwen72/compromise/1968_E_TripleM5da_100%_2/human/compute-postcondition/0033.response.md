Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` must be a positive integer, and all iterations of the loop have been completed.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations of the outer loop. The condition 1 <= t <= 50 still holds.
- **`n`**: The variable `n` is read from input for each test case and must be a positive integer (2 <= n <= 10^3). The value of `n` for each test case is used to determine the number of iterations of the inner loop, but `n` itself is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The variable `i` is used as the loop counter in both the outer and inner loops. After all iterations of the loop, `i` will have completed its range for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, `i` will have gone from 0 to `n-1` in the inner loop, and from 0 to `t-1` in the outer loop.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the state of the variables is that `t` and `n` remain within their initial constraints, and the loop has completed all its iterations.
