Reasoning:

The task is to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances (\(\mathcal{H}\)) between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program provided attempts to solve this by selecting specific cells for each test case.

Let's break down the program and analyze its correctness:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \(n\).

2. **Output for Each Test Case**:
   - The program always prints the cell \((1, 1)\).
   - It then prints the cell \((1, 2)\).
   - For the remaining cells, it prints \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\).

3. **Analysis of the Output**:
   - The first two cells \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are fixed.
   - The remaining cells are on the diagonal from \((3, 3)\) to \((n, n)\).

Let's consider the Manhattan distances generated by this approach:
- The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\).
- The distance between \((1, 1)\) and any cell \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1)\).
- The distance between \((1, 2)\) and any cell \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(|1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-1) - 1\).
- The distance between any two cells \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) for \(i, j \geq 3\) is \(|i-j| + |i-j| = 2|i-j|\).

The set of distances \(\mathcal{H}\) includes:
- 1 (from \((1, 1)\) to \((1, 2)\))
- \(2(i-1)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\)
- \(2(i-1) - 1\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\)
- \(2|i-j|\) for \(i, j\) from 3 to \(n\)

For \(n = 2\), the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which is correct.

For \(n = 3\), the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which is correct.

For \(n = 4\), the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6\}\), which is not the maximum possible set. The maximum possible set should include all distances from 0 to \(2n-2\).

For \(n = 5\), the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8\}\), which is not the maximum possible set. The maximum possible set should include all distances from 0 to \(2n-2\).

For \(n = 6\), the set \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10\}\), which is not the maximum possible set. The maximum possible set should include all distances from 0 to \(2n-2\).

The program does not generate all possible distances from 0 to \(2n-2\), which is the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
