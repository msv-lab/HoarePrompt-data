### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and can perform an operation to replace a subarray `a[l:r]` with the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1`**
   - This function is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `a[start_index:end_index]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid recomputation.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the function returns the maximum of 1 and the element at `start_index`.
   - For larger subarrays, it tries to split the subarray into smaller parts and compute the MEX for each part, then combines the results.
   - However, the function does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. It seems to be trying to maximize the sum by considering different splits, but it does not actually compute the MEX.

3. **Function 2: `func_2`**
   - This function is supposed to construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the maximum value and then tries to find the sequence of operations that leads to this value.
   - The function has a logical issue in the `make_stairs` call, which is not properly integrated into the sequence of operations.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs`**
   - This function is supposed to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already a staircase and if not, it recursively transforms the subarray.
   - The function updates the array `arr` and the result list `res` with the operations.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the transformation logic is flawed.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The program does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarrays.
   - The `func_1` and `func_2` functions are not properly integrated to ensure that the operations are valid and lead to the maximum sum.
   - The `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented to handle the transformation of subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It lacks the proper MEX calculation and the logic to construct the sequence of operations is flawed.

**Correctness: False**
