Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not solve the problem as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues in detail:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a subarray is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray. However, the function `func_1` does not calculate the MEX. Instead, it seems to be trying to maximize a different value, which is the sum of squared lengths of subarrays. This is fundamentally different from the MEX operation required by the problem.

2. **Incorrect Sum Maximization**:
   - The program's goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing the MEX operation on subarrays. The function `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to maximize a different value, which is the sum of squared lengths of subarrays. This does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the array elements after performing the MEX operation.

3. **Incorrect Transformation**:
   - The function `make_stairs` is intended to transform the subarray to achieve the maximum sum, but it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. The function attempts to create a "staircase" form where each element matches its index, but this is not the correct transformation. The correct transformation should involve setting the subarray elements to the MEX value of the subarray.

### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
4
0 1 2 3
```

The expected output should be:
```
10 1
1 4
```

- **Expected Behavior**:
  - The MEX of the entire array `[0, 1, 2, 3]` is 4 (since 4 is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array).
  - Performing the operation on the entire array `[0, 1, 2, 3]` with `l=1` and `r=4` will set all elements to 4, resulting in the array `[4, 4, 4, 4]`.
  - The sum of the array is `4 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16`, and the number of operations is 1.

- **Actual Behavior**:
  - The function `func_1` will not correctly calculate the MEX.
  - The function `func_2` will not correctly determine the operations to achieve the maximum sum.
  - The function `make_stairs` will not correctly transform the array to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the elements of the array `a` by performing the specified MEX operations. The issues identified in the original assessment are valid, and the program's behavior does not align with the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
