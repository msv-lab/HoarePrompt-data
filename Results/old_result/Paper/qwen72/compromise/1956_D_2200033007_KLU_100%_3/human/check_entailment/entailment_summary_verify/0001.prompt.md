You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies a list `res` to store operations as tuples `(l, r)`. It checks if the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is already in a "staircase" form (where each element matches its index from 0 to `i`). If the subarray is already in this form, the function returns without performing any operations. If not, the function recursively modifies the subarray to ensure it matches the staircase form, appending the necessary operations to `res`. After the function concludes, `arr` will have the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` set to the staircase form, and `res` will contain the operations used to achieve this. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and can perform operations to replace a subarray with its MEX value.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array elements using no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible sum of the subarray `a[start_index:end_index]` after performing the allowed operations.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index == end_index`, where the MEX is either 0 or 1, depending on the value of `arr[start_index]`.
   - For subarrays of length greater than 1, it considers different ways to split the subarray and calculates the maximum sum by including the MEX of the subarray in the sum.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the subarray.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It first calls `func_1` to get the maximum value for the subarray.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - Otherwise, it recursively checks different splits of the subarray to find the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function transforms a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`).
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and updates the array and the result list `res` with the operations performed.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The program uses a combination of dynamic programming and recursive backtracking to find the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.
   - The `make_stairs` function ensures that the subarray is transformed correctly to achieve the maximum sum.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the subarray length is 1.
   - It also handles the case where the subarray is already in the desired form (a staircase).

7. **Complexity**:
   - The dynamic programming approach ensures that the program does not perform redundant calculations.
   - The recursive backtracking ensures that the sequence of operations is constructed correctly.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly calculates the maximum sum of the array after performing the allowed operations.
- The sequence of operations is correctly constructed to achieve this sum.
- The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
