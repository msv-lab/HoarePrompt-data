The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` is called, which will recursively reduce the value of `i` by 1 and perform the same operations as described in the initial state, but with the new value of `i`. Since the function call is a recursive one, the state of the variables `i`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, and `is_already_stairs` will be updated within the function, but the specific details of these updates depend on the implementation of `make_stairs`. However, based on the initial state, we can infer that:

- `i` is now `i - 1`.
- The function `make_stairs` will continue to modify `arr` and `res` as it progresses through the recursive calls.
- `is_already_stairs` is still False, as it is not modified by the code snippet.
- The initial conditions for `arr`, `start_index`, and `res` still hold, but they will be updated in subsequent recursive calls.

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer and is now `i - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers where all elements from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` (inclusive) are set to `i - 1`, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i + 1`, `res` is a list that includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `i` is greater than 0.**
