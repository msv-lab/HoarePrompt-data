Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `res` is a list that now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index from 0 to `i-1`, and `i` is greater than 0, and `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`.** 

The tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` has been added to the list `res`. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
