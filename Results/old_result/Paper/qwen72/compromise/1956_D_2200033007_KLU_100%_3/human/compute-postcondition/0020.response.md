The function `make_stairs` accepts a parameter `i`, which is a non-negative integer. It also implicitly accepts a list of integers `arr`, an integer `start_index` such that `0 <= start_index <= len(arr) - i - 1`, and a list `res` that will store the operations as tuples `(l, r)`.

Case_1: The program returns without any value.
Case_2: The program returns None.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies a list `res` to store operations as tuples `(l, r)`. It does not return any value in either case.**
