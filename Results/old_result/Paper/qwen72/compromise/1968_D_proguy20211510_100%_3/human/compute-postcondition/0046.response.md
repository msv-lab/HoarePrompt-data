Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is the final index in the sequence of `p` that leads back to a previously visited index, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `ps - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except those indices that have been visited, which are set to 1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute until it encounters a previously visited index in the `vis` list.
- After the loop terminates, the variable `ps` holds the final index in the sequence of `p` that leads back to a previously visited index.
- The list `paths` contains the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `ps - 1` until the loop breaks.
- The list `vis` will have 1s at the indices that were visited during the loop execution, and 0s at the indices that were not visited.
- The variables `n`, `k`, `p`, `a`, and `pathb` remain unchanged from their initial state, as they are not modified within the loop.
