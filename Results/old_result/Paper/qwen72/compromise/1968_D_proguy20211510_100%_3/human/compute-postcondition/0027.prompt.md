Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is an integer greater than 0, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is an empty list, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except the element at index `pb - 1`, which is set to 1.
Code of the loop:
while True:
    pathb.append(a[pb - 1])
    pb = p[pb - 1]
    if vis[pb - 1] == 1:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]` (where `pb` is the new value), `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except the element at index `pb - 1` (where `pb` is the new value), which is set to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` (where `pb` is the new value) and the previously appended element `a[pb - 1]` (where `pb` is the old value), `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except the element at index `pb - 1` (where `pb` is the new value), which is set to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]` (where `pb` is the new value), `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` (where `pb` is the new value), which is set to 1. If `vis[pb - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
