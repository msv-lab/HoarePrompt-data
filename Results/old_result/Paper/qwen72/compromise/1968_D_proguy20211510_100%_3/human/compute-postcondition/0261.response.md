Output State: **`resb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list with at least `len(pathb)` elements, `i` is 0, `paths` must have at least one element, `curr` is the last computed value of `preb + pathb[len(pathb) - 1] * (k - (len(pathb) - 1))`, and `k` is less than 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
