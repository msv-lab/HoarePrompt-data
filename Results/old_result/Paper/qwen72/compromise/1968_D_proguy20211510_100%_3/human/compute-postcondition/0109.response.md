Postcondition: **`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `pb` is now the integer value of `p[pb - 1]`, and the element at index `pb - 1` in `vis` is 1.**
