Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is the final value after the loop terminates, `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` at the indices specified by the sequence of `p` starting from `pb - 1` until a previously visited index is encountered, `paths` is a list containing the element `a[ps - 1]`, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `vis[ps - 1]` which is set to 1. If `vis[ps - 1]` is 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.***
