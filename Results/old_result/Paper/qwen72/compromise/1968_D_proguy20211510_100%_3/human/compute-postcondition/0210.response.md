Output State: **The loop has completed all iterations. `i` is `len(paths) - 1`, `paths` has at least `len(paths)` elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[len(paths) - 1] * (k - (len(paths) - 1))`, `pres` is the sum of the initial `pres` and all elements in `paths`, `ress` is the maximum value of all `curr` values computed during the loop iterations, `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `ress`. `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user. `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[pb - 1]` and `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]`. `paths` is an empty list. `vis` is a list of `n` zeros, except `vis[pb - 1]` and `vis[p[pb - 1] - 1]` are now 1. `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
