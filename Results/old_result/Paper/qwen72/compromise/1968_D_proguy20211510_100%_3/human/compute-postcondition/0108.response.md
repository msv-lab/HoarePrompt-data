Output State: **`p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the element `a[pb - 1]`, `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of zeros of length `n` with the element at index `pb - 1` set to 1, `pb` is now the integer value of `p[pb - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pb = p[pb - 1]` updates the value of `pb` to the integer value at the index `pb - 1` in the list `p`.
- All other variables (`p`, `n`, `k`, `ps`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress`, `a`, `pathb`, `paths`, `vis`) remain unchanged.
- The new value of `pb` is specifically the integer at the index `pb - 1` in the list `p`.
