Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is now 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n`, `k`, `pres`, `preb`, `resb`, `i`, `curr`, `ress` are unchanged, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `pb - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again, `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again, `ps` is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index, `resb` is 0, `ress` is 0, `preb` is 0, `pres` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(pathb)):
    if k < i + 1:
        break
    curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)
    preb += pathb[i]
    resb = max(resb, curr)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `n` is unchanged. `k` is unchanged. `pres` is 0. `preb` is now `pathb[0] * k`. `resb` is now `max(0, pathb[0] * k)`. `curr` is now `pathb[0] * k`. `ress` is 0. `i` is 0. `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again. `ps` is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `n` is unchanged. `k` is unchanged. `pres` is 0. `preb` is now `pathb[0] * k + pathb[1]`. `resb` is now `max(0, pathb[0] * k, pathb[0] * k + pathb[i] * (k - i))`. `curr` is now `pathb[0] * k + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. `ress` is 0. `i` is 1. `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again. `ps` is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `vis` is a list where the element at index `ps - 1` is 1, and all other elements remain 0. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user. `n` is unchanged. `k` is unchanged. `pres` is 0. `preb` is `pathb[0] * k + pathb[1] + pathb[2]`. `resb` is `max(resb, preb + pathb[i] * (k - i))`. `curr` is `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)`. `ress` is 0. `i` is 2. `paths` is a list containing the elements of `a` that correspond to the indices in the cycle starting from `ps - 1` and following the indices in `p` until a visited index is encountered again. `ps` is now the index where the loop first encountered a previously visited index. If `k` is less than `i + 1`, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
