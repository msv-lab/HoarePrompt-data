Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer greater than 0, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `pathb` is a list containing the elements `a[p[pb - 1] - 1]` and `a[pb - 1]` (where `pb` is the new value), `paths` is an empty list, `vis` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except the element at index `p[pb - 1] - 1` (where `pb` is the new value), which is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
