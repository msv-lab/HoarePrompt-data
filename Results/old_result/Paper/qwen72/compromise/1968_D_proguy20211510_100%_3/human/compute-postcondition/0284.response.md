Postcondition: **`pres` is the sum of the first `min(k, len(paths))` elements of `paths`, `resb` is the maximum value of the cumulative sums `preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `len(pathb) - 1` where `k >= i + 1`, `ress` is the maximum value of `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)` for all `i` from 0 to `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`, `preb` is the sum of all elements in `pathb`, `i` is `min(k, len(paths)) - 1`, `paths` must have at least `min(k, len(paths))` elements, `curr` is the last computed value of `pres + paths[min(k, len(paths)) - 1] * (k - (min(k, len(paths)) - 1))`. If `k` is less than `len(paths)`, the loop breaks after `k` iterations. Additionally, `resb` is greater than or equal to `ress`.**
