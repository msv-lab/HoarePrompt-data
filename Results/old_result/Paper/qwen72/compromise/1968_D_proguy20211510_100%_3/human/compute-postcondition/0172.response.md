Output State: **`i` is 1, `paths` must have at least two elements, `curr` is `pres + paths[0] * (k - 0)`, if `k` is less than 1, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of, `pres` is `pres + paths[0]`, `ress` is the maximum of the previous `ress` and `pres + paths[0] * k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
