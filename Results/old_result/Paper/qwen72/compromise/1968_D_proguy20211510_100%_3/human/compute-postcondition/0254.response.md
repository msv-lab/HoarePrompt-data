Postcondition: ***`resb` is the maximum of `0` and `pathb[0] * (k - 0)`, `ress` is 0, `preb` is `pathb[0] + pathb[1]`, `pres` is 0, `pathb` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `curr` is `preb + pathb[1] * (k - 1)`, and `resb` is the maximum of `resb` and `curr`. If `k < i + 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
