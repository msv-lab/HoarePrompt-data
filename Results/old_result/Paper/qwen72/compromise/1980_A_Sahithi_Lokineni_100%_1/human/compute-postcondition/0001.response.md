The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided context, it seems that the function's behavior might depend on some implicit or external parameters (t, n, m, a) which are not directly passed to the function. Given the constraints and the specified output, the function always returns 0 regardless of the values of t, n, m, and a.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0.**
