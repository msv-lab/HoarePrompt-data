Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it uses an undefined function `default_value` when initializing the `defaultdict`. The correct way to initialize a `defaultdict` with a default value of `0` is to use `int` as the default factory function, which returns `0` for missing keys.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Corrected initialization
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':  # Iterate over all required difficulty levels
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    
    print(ans)
```

This corrected version initializes the `defaultdict` correctly and iterates over the required difficulty levels ('A' to 'G') to ensure that the count of each difficulty level is at least `m`. If the count is less than `m`, it calculates the difference and adds it to the answer. This ensures that the program works as intended.
