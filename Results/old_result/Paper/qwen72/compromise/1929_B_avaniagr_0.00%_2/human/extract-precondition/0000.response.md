Precondition: **The function `func` is not properly defined to match the problem description. It should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that must contain at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).**

Here is the correct function definition based on the problem description:
```
def min_cells_to_color(n, k):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.**
