Output State: **The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line), splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, and then prints a calculated value based on the given formula. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration, but they are not retained after the loop finishes. The output state does not include the values of `n` and `k` since they are not relevant after the loop. The function `func` remains undefined as it was in the initial state.**
