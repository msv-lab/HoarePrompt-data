Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized to all zeros. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `new_dp[2]` is set to `(dp[1] % MOD)`, and `j` remains 1.***
