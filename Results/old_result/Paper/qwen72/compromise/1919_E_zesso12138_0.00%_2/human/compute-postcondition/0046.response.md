The code snippet updates the `new_dp` list at index `j + 1` by adding the value of `dp[j]` to the current value at `new_dp[j + 1]` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. Let's break down the changes:

- `j` is 2.
- `new_dp[j + 1]` is `new_dp[3]`.
- `dp[j]` is `dp[2]`.

The new value of `new_dp[3]` is calculated as:
\[ \text{new\_dp}[3] = (\text{new\_dp}[3] + \text{dp}[2]) \% \text{MOD} \]

Since `new_dp` was initially a list of zeros, `new_dp[3]` was 0 before the update. Therefore, the new value of `new_dp[3]` is simply `dp[2] % MOD`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element `dp[j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros except `new_dp[3]` which is `dp[2] % MOD`, `j` is 2.**
