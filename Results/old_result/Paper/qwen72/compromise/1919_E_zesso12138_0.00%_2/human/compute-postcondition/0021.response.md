Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (greater than 0) - 2, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `p` is a list of `n` integers extracted from `data[index:index + n]` and converted to integers, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 3 + 2 * `n`, `results` is a list containing the value returned by `func_1(n, p)` and the new `result` value, `result` is the value returned by `func_1(n, p)`. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]` based on the new `index` value.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data[index]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `p`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `result`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
