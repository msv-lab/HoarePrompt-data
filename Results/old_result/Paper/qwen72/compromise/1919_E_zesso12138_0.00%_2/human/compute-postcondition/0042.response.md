Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element `dp[j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros except for the element at index `j - 1` which is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` if `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `dp[j]` is greater than 0 and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` under the conditions that `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `dp[j]` is greater than 0, and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.
- All other variables (`n`, `p`, `dp`, `offset`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated based on the conditions and the value of `dp[j]`.
