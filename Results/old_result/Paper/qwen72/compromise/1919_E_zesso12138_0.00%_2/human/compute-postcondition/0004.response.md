Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| ≤ n and p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ ... ≤ p_n, `data` is a list of strings from the input split by whitespace, `index` is 1.**

The value of `index` has been incremented by 1, changing its value from 0 to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
