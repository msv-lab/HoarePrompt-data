Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` where each element `dp[j]` is the sum of the number of ways to reach position `j - n` from position `0` using steps of +1 or -1, modulo MOD, `offset` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2, `new_dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` initialized to all zeros, and `j` is 2. If `dp[2] > 0` and `j - 1 >= 0`, `new_dp[1]` is set to `(new_dp[1] + dp[2]) % MOD`. Otherwise, `new_dp` remains unchanged.***
