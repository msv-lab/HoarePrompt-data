Postcondition: ***`n` remains a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is still a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where |p_i| <= n for all 0 <= i < n, `dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1, `offset` is still equal to `n`, `i` is 3, `new_dp` is a list of length 2 * n + 1 initialized to all zeros. If `j - 1 >= 0`, then `j` is 0, `dp[j]` is greater than 0, and the code raises an `IndexError` due to accessing `new_dp[-1]`. If `j - 1 < 0`, the state remains unchanged.***
