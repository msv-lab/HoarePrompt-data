The only variables in the loop head are `iterable` and `loop`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `loop`. If `loop` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `n`, and the constraints are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `loop` must be greater than 0, and `iterable` should start at 0 (as it is the default behavior of `range`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, each test case has at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, no two constraints are the same, `loop` is greater than 0, `iterable` is 0**
