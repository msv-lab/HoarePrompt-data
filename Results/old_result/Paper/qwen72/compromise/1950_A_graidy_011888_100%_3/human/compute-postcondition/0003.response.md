The function `func` is intended to be called multiple times with different sets of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`, where each digit is an integer in the range 0 to 9, inclusive. The number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the function signature provided does not include these parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is unclear based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function is intended to be called multiple times with different sets of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the function signature does not specify these parameters. The function's return value and behavior are not clear from the provided information.**
