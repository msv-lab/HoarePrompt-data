Postcondition: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` contain the respective appended values from the loop, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50001, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, and either `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).**
