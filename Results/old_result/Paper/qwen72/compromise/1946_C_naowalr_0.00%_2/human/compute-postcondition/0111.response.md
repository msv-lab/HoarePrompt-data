Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `leftover`, and the condition `R - L <= 1` remain unchanged. `L` is now 1. `R` is now 100001. `numCuts` is 0. `x` is 50001.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `numCuts = 0` sets the variable `numCuts` to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
