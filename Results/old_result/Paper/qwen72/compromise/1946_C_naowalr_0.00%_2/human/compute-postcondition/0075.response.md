Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where each element `a` and `b` read from the input during the loop has been appended to `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` respectively, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is 99999, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L > 1`. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `100000`), then `L` is 100000 and `R` is 100001. Otherwise, `L` is 99998 and `R` is 100000.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated to `(L + R) // 2`. Given the initial conditions, `L` is either 99998 or 100000, and `R` is either 100000 or 100001. Therefore, the average of `L` and `R` is 99999. All other variables remain unchanged.
