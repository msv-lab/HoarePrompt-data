Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `adj` as a list of empty lists with a length of `n + 1`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain as specified in the initial state. The structure of `adj` is now defined, but its content remains empty.
