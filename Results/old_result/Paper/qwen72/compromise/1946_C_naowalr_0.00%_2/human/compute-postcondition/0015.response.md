Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a]`, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input.**

Explanation: The code `adj[b].append(a)` adds the integer `a` to the list `adj[b]`. Initially, `adj[b]` contained `[a, a]`, so after appending `a`, `adj[b]` now contains `[a, a, a]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
