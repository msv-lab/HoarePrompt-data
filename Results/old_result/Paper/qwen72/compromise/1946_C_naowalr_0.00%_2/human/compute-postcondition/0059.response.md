Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1` where `adj[a]` contains `[b, b, b]` and `adj[b]` contains `[a, a]`, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the new integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**

Explanation: The code `adj[a].append(b)` appends the value `b` to the list `adj[a]`. Initially, `adj[a]` contained `[b, b]`, so after appending `b`, `adj[a]` now contains `[b, b, b]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
