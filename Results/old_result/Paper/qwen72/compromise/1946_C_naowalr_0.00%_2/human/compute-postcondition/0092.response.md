Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `z` is 2, `n` is `new_n`, `k` is `new_k`, `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input, `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function, `numCuts` is 0, `R - L <= 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]` initializes `adj` as a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `z`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `x`, `leftover`, `numCuts`, `R - L <= 1`) remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `adj` was already a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, so the reinitialization does not change its state.
