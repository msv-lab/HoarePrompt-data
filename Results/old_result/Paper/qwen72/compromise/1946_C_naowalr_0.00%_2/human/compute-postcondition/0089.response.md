To determine what will be printed by the `print(L)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `z` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input.
   - `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`. Each element `a` and `b` read from the input during the loop has been appended to `adj[a]` and `adj[b]` respectively.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `a` and `b` are the last integers read from the input.
   - `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates.
   - `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function.
   - `numCuts` is 0.
   - `R - L <= 1`.

2. **Key Points:**
   - The final values of `L` and `R` are such that `R - L <= 1`.
   - The `print(L)` statement will print the value of `L`.

3. **Explanation:**
   - The condition `R - L <= 1` implies that `L` and `R` are very close to each other, differing by at most 1.
   - Since `L` and `R` are the result of a binary search or similar process, they converge to a specific range where `R - L <= 1`.
   - The value of `L` will be the lower bound of this final range.

Given the above conditions, the value of `L` will be the lower bound of the final range where `R - L <= 1`.

Output: **L (where L is the lower bound of the final range such that R - L <= 1)**
