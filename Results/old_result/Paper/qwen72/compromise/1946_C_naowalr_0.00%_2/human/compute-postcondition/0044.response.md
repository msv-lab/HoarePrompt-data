To determine what will be printed by the `print(L)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `z` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `adj` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`.
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input.
   - `x` is the final value of `(L + R) // 2` before the loop terminates.
   - `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function.
   - `numCuts` is 0.
   - `R - L <= 1`.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The final values of `L` and `R` are such that `R - L <= 1`.
   - The values of `L` and `R` are adjusted based on conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop.

Given that `R - L <= 1` at the end of the loop, the possible values for `L` and `R` are very close to each other. Since `R - L <= 1`, `L` and `R` can either be equal or differ by 1.

### Analysis:
- The loop adjusts `L` and `R` based on certain conditions, but the final condition ensures that `R - L <= 1`.
- This means that `L` and `R` are either the same or `R` is one more than `L`.

### Conclusion:
- When the `print(L)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `L`, which is the lower bound of the range `[L, R]` where `R - L <= 1`.

Output: **L (where L is the lower bound of the range [L, R] such that R - L <= 1)**
