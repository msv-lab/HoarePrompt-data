Output State: **`n` remains `new_n`, `i` is `n - 2`, `adj` is a list of lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` in the input, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` in the input. The variables `t`, `z`, `leftover`, and the condition `R - L <= 1` remain unchanged. `L` is now 1. `R` is now 100001. `numCuts` is 0. `x` is 50001.** 

Explanation: The value of `x` is calculated as `(L + R) // 2`. Given `L` is 1 and `R` is 100001, the calculation is `(1 + 100001) // 2`, which equals 50001. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
