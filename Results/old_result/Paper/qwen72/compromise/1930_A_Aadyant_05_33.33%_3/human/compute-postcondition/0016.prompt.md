Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` is an empty list, `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer equal to the integer value of the input string, `b` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of the third element of `list1` (if `i` is 1), `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an input string

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of the third element of `list1` and the integer value of the fifth element of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `a` must be greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of the third element of `list1` and the integer value of the fifth element of `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an input string, `i` is 2, `a` must be greater than 2, `list2` now also contains the integer value of the seventh element of `list1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
