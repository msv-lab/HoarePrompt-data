Output State: **`num` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is an empty list, `list2` contains the integer value of the third element of `list1` (if `i` is 1), `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an input string**

Explanation:
- The code `list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))` appends the integer value of the element at index `2 * i` in `list1` to `list2`.
- Since `i` is not specified in the initial state, we assume `i` is 1 (the smallest positive integer) for the purpose of this calculation.
- The third element of `list1` (index 2) is converted to an integer and appended to `list2`.
- All other variables (`num`, `numbers`, `out`, `list1`, `a`, `b`) remain unchanged.
