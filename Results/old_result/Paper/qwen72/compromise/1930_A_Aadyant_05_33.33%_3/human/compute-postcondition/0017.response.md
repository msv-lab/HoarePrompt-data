The code `out.append(sum(list2))` appends the sum of the elements in `list2` to the list `out`. 

- `list2` contains the integer values of every second element starting from the third element in `list1` (up to the last element that can be accessed).
- `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace.
- `out` is initially an empty list, so after the code is executed, `out` will contain a single element, which is the sum of the elements in `list2`.
- The values of `num`, `numbers`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`num` is a string that, when converted to an integer, must be greater than 0, `numbers` is 0, `out` is a list containing the sum of the elements in `list2`, `list2` contains the integer values of every second element starting from the third element in `list1`, `list1` is a sorted list of strings obtained by splitting the input string `b` by whitespace, `a` is an integer greater than 0, `b` is an input string.**
