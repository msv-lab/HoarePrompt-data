Output State: **`balance_info` is now sorted by the balance in ascending order, and for items with the same balance, by the position in descending order. `balance` is 0, as the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.**

Explanation: The `balance_info` list is sorted using the `sort` method with a key function that sorts the `BalanceInfo` objects first by their `balance` in ascending order and then by their `position` in descending order. The `balance` variable remains unchanged at 0, and the string `s` is still a balanced parentheses sequence.
