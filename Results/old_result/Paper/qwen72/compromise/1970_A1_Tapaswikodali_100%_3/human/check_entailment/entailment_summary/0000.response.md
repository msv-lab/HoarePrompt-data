Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to take a balanced parentheses sequence and apply a specific sorting operation to it, which involves sorting the characters based on the balance of the prefix before each character, and breaking ties by the position in decreasing order.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is used to compare two `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It first compares the `balance` attribute. If they are different, it returns the difference, which will be used to sort the objects in ascending order of balance.
   - If the `balance` attributes are the same, it returns the difference in positions in reverse order (i.e., `infoB.position - infoA.position`), which ensures that ties are broken by position in decreasing order.
   - This function is correctly implemented to achieve the sorting criteria described in the problem.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes the input string `s` and processes it.
   - It initializes a list `balance_info` to store `BalanceInfo` objects for each character in the string.
   - It iterates through the string, updating the balance and appending a `BalanceInfo` object for each character.
   - After collecting all the `BalanceInfo` objects, it sorts them using the `func_1` comparison logic.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list and prints it.
   - The function correctly handles the input and produces the expected output based on the problem description.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the input string `s` and passes it to `func_2`.
   - `func_2` processes the string as described and prints the balanced shuffle.
   - The program does not return any value but prints the result directly, which is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
