To determine what will be printed by the `print(a)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the structure of the list `a`:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The elements at even indices are reversed.
   - The elements at odd indices remain unchanged.
   - `n` is the length of the permutation `p`.

2. **Understanding the List `a`**:
   - The list `a` starts with integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.
   - The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed.
   - The elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) remain in their original positions.

3. **Example to Illustrate**:
   - Suppose `n = 5`, then the initial list `a` would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The elements at even indices (0, 2, 4) are `[1, 3, 5]`.
   - The elements at odd indices (1, 3) are `[2, 4]`.
   - Reversing the elements at even indices, we get `[5, 2, 3, 4, 1]`.

4. **General Case**:
   - For any `n`, the list `a` will have the first element at index 0, the third element at index 2, the fifth element at index 4, and so on, reversed.
   - The elements at odd indices will remain in their original positions.

5. **Output**:
   - The `print(a)` statement will print the list `a` with the elements at even indices reversed and the elements at odd indices unchanged.

Output: **[n, 2, n-2, 4, n-4, 6, ..., 1] (where the elements at even indices are reversed and the elements at odd indices remain unchanged)**

This output format ensures that the list `a` is described accurately based on the given initial state.
