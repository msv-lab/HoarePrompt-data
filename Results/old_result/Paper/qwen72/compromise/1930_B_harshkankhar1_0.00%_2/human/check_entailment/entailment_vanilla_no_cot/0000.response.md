Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Permutation Generation**: For each test case, the program generates a permutation of length `n` using `list(range(1, int(input()) + 1))`. This ensures that the list `a` contains all integers from 1 to `n` in ascending order.

3. **Permutation Modification**: The program then reverses the elements at even indices (0-based) using `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`. This step is crucial to ensure that the permutation does not have the property where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct indices `i` and `j`.

4. **Output**: The modified permutation is printed, which is a valid solution for the problem.

### Explanation of the Permutation Modification:
- By reversing the elements at even indices, the program ensures that the relative order of elements at even and odd indices is changed. This helps in breaking any potential patterns that could lead to the divisibility condition being met.
- For example, for `n = 4`, the initial permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the elements at even indices, it becomes `[3, 2, 1, 4]`. This permutation does not have the property where `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}` for any distinct indices `i` and `j`.

### Example Test Cases:
- For `n = 4`, the initial permutation is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. After reversing the even indices, it becomes `[3, 2, 1, 4]`, which is a valid permutation.
- For `n = 3`, the initial permutation is `[1, 2, 3]`. After reversing the even indices, it remains `[1, 2, 3]`, which is also a valid permutation.

Thus, the program correctly generates a valid permutation for each test case, satisfying the problem requirements.
