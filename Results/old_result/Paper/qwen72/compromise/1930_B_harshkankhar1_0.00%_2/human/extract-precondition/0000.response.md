Precondition: **The function `func_1` should take a single integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `n` is the length of the permutation `p`. The function should ensure that the input `n` is a positive integer within the specified range.** 

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
```

With this correction, the precondition is:

**n is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.**
