### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string` and converts it into a list of characters `s`.
   - It then calculates the length `n` of the string.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the function immediately prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome.
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the function prints "YES" and the entire string as the partition, since the string is already non-palindromic.

3. **Uniform Character Handling:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the function prints "NO" because any substring of a uniform character string is a palindrome.
   - If all but one character are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the middle character (for odd-length strings) is different from `x`. If it is, the function prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as the partition.

4. **General Case Handling:**
   - The function iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character `x` and sets `count` to its index.
   - It then continues to iterate, checking for the second character that is different from `x` and sets `count2` to the number of characters equal to `x` after the first different character.
   - Depending on the values of `count` and `count2`, the function prints "YES" and a valid partition of the string into two non-palindromic substrings.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If none of the conditions for a "YES" output are met, the function prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The function correctly handles the edge cases where the string length is 1 or all characters are the same.
- It also correctly identifies when the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings by checking the first and second different characters.
- However, the logic for handling the general case is overly complex and can be simplified. The function should be able to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings more straightforwardly.

### Simplified Logic:
- If the string length is 1, print "NO".
- If the string is not a palindrome (i.e., `s != s[::-1]`), print "YES" and the entire string as the partition.
- If the string is a palindrome, try to partition it into two substrings such that neither is a palindrome. This can be done by finding the first character that is different from the first character and splitting the string at that point.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct in its logic and handling of edge cases, but it can be simplified for better readability and efficiency. However, it does correctly solve the problem as described.
