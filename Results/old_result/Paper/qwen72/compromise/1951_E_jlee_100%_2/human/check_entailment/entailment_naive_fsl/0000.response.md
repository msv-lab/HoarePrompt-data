Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string can be partitioned into more than two non-palindromic substrings correctly. For example, consider the input string "abacaba". The program will output "NO" for this string, but it is possible to partition it into non-palindromic substrings such as "aba" and "caba" or "abac" and "aba". The program fails to explore all possible partitions and only checks for the simplest cases, leading to incorrect results for some valid inputs.
