Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`.
- `string` is the new input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of the list `s`.
- `j` is 0.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
- `count2` is less than `count`.
- `done` is False if the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`; otherwise, `done` is True.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

This statement simply prints the string `'YES'`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this `print` statement because it does not reference any of them.

Output: **YES**
