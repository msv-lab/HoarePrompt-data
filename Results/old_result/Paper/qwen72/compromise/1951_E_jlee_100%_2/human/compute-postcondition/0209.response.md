Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0. If `count` > 1, `count2` is equal to `count` and `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` remains 0, and if `count` is less than 1, `done` is False; otherwise, the state of `done` remains unchanged. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.***
