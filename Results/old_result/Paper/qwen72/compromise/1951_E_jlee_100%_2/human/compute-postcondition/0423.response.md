Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is a list of characters from the new input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of the list `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is set to 2 if `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count2` is 0, `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]` or True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables.
- It only affects the flow of the loop, causing the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration.
- All the initial conditions and variable values remain unchanged.
