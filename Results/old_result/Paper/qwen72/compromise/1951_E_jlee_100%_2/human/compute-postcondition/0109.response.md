Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is greater than 0. If `count2` is equal to `count`, and `count` > 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, `count2` is 0, and `done` remains False if `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, otherwise `done` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `done` and the loop remains unchanged.***
