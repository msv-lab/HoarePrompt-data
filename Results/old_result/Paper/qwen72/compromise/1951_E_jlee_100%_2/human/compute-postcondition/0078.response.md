Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, then if `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count`, then if `count` > 1, `done` is True and `count2` is equal to `count`. If `count` <= 1, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False and `count2` is 0. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, then `count2` is 1.***
