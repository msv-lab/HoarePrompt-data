Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string` that must have at least 1 character, `string` is an input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, and `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is updated to `j`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
