Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is an input string.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s = list(string)` converts the input string `string` into a list of its individual characters and assigns this list to the variable `s`. The other variables (`t` and `i`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0 are still valid. The input string `string` is also still valid, but now `s` is a list of its characters.
