Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, which must have at least 1 character.
- `string` is an input string.
- `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is greater than 0.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
- If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False.
- Otherwise, `done` is set to True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, and `n > 1`.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`, so `x = s[0]`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `count` is greater than 0.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The condition `if s[j] != x and count < 1` is checked. Since `count` is greater than 0, this condition will always be False, and `count` will not be set to 1.
   - The condition `if s[j] == s[n - 1 - j]` is checked. If `s[j]` is equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False. Otherwise, `done` is set to True and the loop or if statement is exited.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(string[:j], string[j:])` will split the string `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` is the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j`.
     - `string[j:]` is the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

4. **Values of `j` and `string`:**
   - `j` is 1, so `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of string starting from the second character]**
