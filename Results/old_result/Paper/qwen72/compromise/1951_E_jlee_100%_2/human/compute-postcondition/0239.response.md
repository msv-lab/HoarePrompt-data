Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `i` is 1.
3. `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`.
4. `string` is the new input string.
5. `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1.
6. `x` is the first character of `s`.
7. `j` is 1.
8. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged.
9. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` remains unchanged, and `done` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement.
- Therefore, the `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
