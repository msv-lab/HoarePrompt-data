Let's analyze the initial state step by step:

1. **`t` is greater than 0**: This indicates that `t` is a positive integer.
2. **`i` is 0**: This indicates that `i` is initialized to 0.
3. **`s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`**: This means `s` is a list where each element is a character from the string `string`.
4. **`string` is an input string**: This is the original string from which the list `s` is derived.
5. **`n` is the length of the list `s`**: This means `n` is the number of characters in the string `string`.
6. **`done` is False**: This indicates that the variable `done` is initialized to `False`.
7. **`x` is the first character of `s`**: This means `x` is the first character of the string `string`.
8. **`x` is not equal to the last character of `s`**: This indicates that the first and last characters of the string `string` are different.
9. **The count of `x` in `s` is less than `n`**: This means that the character `x` appears fewer times than the total number of characters in the string `string`.
10. **The count of `x` in `s` is exactly `n - 1`**: This means that `x` appears exactly one less time than the total number of characters in the string `string`.
11. **Either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and the middle element of `s` is `x`**: This indicates that the string `string` either has an even number of characters, or it has an odd number of characters and the middle character is `x`.

Given these conditions, we can deduce the following:
- The string `string` has a length `n`.
- The character `x` is the first character of `string`.
- The character `x` appears exactly `n - 1` times in `string`.
- The last character of `string` is not `x`.
- If `n` is odd, the middle character of `string` is `x`.

From the conditions, we can infer that the string `string` must be of the form where all but one character are `x`, and the one character that is not `x` is at the end of the string. For example, if `n` is 5, the string could be "xxxxa" where 'a' is the last character and 'x' is the first character.

Given this structure, the conditions are met, and the `print('YES')` statement will execute.

Output: **YES**
