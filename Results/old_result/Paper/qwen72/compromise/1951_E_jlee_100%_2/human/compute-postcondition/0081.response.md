The `print('YES')` statement will print the string 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state. The initial state provides information about the variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `string`, `n`, `x`, `j`, `count`, and `done`, but none of these are used in the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
