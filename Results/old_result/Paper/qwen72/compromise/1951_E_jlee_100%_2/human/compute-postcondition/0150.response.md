The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This code snippet simply prints the string `'NO'`. The initial state provides information about various variables and objects, but none of these are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output is solely determined by the literal string `'NO'` that is passed to the `print` function.

Output: **NO**
