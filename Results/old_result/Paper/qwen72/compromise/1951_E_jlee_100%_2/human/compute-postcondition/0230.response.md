Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `count` remains unchanged, `count2` remains unchanged, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1 and `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is less than or equal to 0, `count2` remains unchanged and if `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is False; otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.***
