Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is a list of characters from the input string `string`, `string` is the new input string, `n` is the length of the list `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` is greater than 1, `count` and `count2` remain unchanged, `done` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than or equal to 1, `count2` is set to 0, `count` remains unchanged, `done` remains unchanged, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
