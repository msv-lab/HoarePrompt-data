Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call**:
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with this string and prints the result.
   - This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balances and their corresponding positions. The initial balance is set to 0 at position 0.
   - This initialization is correct and necessary for the subsequent steps.

3. **Computing Prefix Balances**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` to compute the prefix balance for each character.
   - For each character at position `i`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented by 1.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented by 1.
   - The balance at each position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d`.
   - This step correctly computes the prefix balances for the input string.

4. **Removing the Last Entry**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the balance at the end of the sequence is 0, and it is not needed for the sorting step.
   - This step is correct and necessary to ensure that the dictionary `d` only contains the prefix balances up to the second-to-last position.

5. **Sorting the Dictionary**:
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance. If two positions have the same balance, they are sorted in decreasing order of their positions.
   - This sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The sorting key `(x[1], -x[0])` is correct, as it sorts by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order when balances are equal.

6. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the input string `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary `d`.
   - This step is correct and follows the sorted positions, ensuring that the balanced shuffle operation is applied correctly.

7. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns the constructed string `ans`.
   - This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.

8. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly computes the prefix balances and sorts them as required.
   - The construction of the result string `ans` follows the sorted positions, ensuring that the balanced shuffle operation is applied correctly.
   - The example provided in the problem description is correctly handled by the program.

Given the above steps, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
