You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a balanced parentheses sequence `s` and returns a string `ans` containing the characters from `s` rearranged by their depth in ascending order and by their original positions in descending order. The input `s` is a non-empty string of balanced parentheses with a length not exceeding 500,000. After the function concludes, the dictionary `d` is no longer in its original state and has been modified to store the depth of parentheses at each position, and `ans` contains the rearranged string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call**:
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with this string and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balances and their corresponding positions. The initial balance is set to 0 at position 0.

3. **Computing Prefix Balances**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` to compute the prefix balance for each character.
   - For each character at position `i`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented by 1.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented by 1.
   - The balance at each position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d`.

4. **Removing the Last Entry**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the balance at the end of the sequence is not needed for the sorting step.

5. **Sorting the Dictionary**:
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance. If two positions have the same balance, they are sorted in decreasing order of their positions.
   - This sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

6. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the input string `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary `d`.

7. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns the constructed string `ans`.

8. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly computes the prefix balances and sorts them as required.
   - The construction of the result string `ans` follows the sorted positions, ensuring that the balanced shuffle operation is applied correctly.

Given the above steps, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.
