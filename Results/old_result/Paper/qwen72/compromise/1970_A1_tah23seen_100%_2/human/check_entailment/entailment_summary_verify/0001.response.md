Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Function Call**:
   - The program reads a string `n` from the input.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with this string and prints the result.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `d` to store the prefix balances and their corresponding positions. The initial balance is set to 0 at position 0.
   - This initialization is correct.

3. **Computing Prefix Balances**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` to compute the prefix balance for each character.
   - For each character at position `i`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented by 1.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented by 1.
   - The balance at each position `i + 1` is stored in the dictionary `d`.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Removing the Last Entry**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the balance at the end of the sequence is not needed for the sorting step.
   - This step is correct. The balance at the end of the sequence should be 0, and it is not needed for the sorting.

5. **Sorting the Dictionary**:
   - The dictionary `d` is sorted based on the prefix balance. If two positions have the same balance, they are sorted in decreasing order of their positions.
   - This sorting step ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.
   - The sorting key `key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0])` correctly sorts the dictionary by prefix balance in ascending order and by position in descending order.

6. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the input string `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary `d`.
   - However, there is a subtle issue here. The positions in the dictionary `d` are 1-based, but the string `s` is 0-based. This means that when accessing `s[i]` in the loop, it should actually be `s[i-1]` to get the correct character.

7. **Returning the Result**:
   - The function returns the constructed string `ans`.
   - This part is correct.

8. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly computes the prefix balances and sorts them as required.
   - However, the construction of the result string `ans` does not follow the sorted positions correctly due to the off-by-one error in accessing the string `s`.

Given the above steps, the program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem due to the off-by-one error in accessing the string `s`.

Final: **False**
