Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `n` and passes it to the function `func_1`.

2. **Dictionary Initialization**: The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which correctly represents the balance before the first character of the string.

3. **Balance Calculation**: The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d` for each character. If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if it is ')', the balance is decremented. This correctly computes the balance of the prefix at each position.

4. **Dictionary Cleanup**: The program removes the last entry from the dictionary using `d.pop(n)`, which is correct because the balance at the end of the string is always 0 (since the string is balanced), and this entry is not needed for the sorting step.

5. **Sorting**: The dictionary `d` is converted to a list of tuples and sorted based on the balance in ascending order and the position in descending order. This step is crucial for the balanced shuffle operation. The sorting is done using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`, which correctly sorts the positions by their balance and then by their original positions in reverse order.

6. **String Construction**: The program constructs the result string `ans` by iterating through the sorted list and appending the corresponding characters from the input string `s` to `ans`. This correctly rearranges the characters according to the balanced shuffle operation.

7. **Output**: The function returns the constructed string `ans`, which is then printed.

Given the above steps, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The logic and the state transitions are consistent with the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
