Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Dictionary Initialization and Usage**:
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0`, which is correct for the initial balance.
   - However, the dictionary is then populated with keys as positions (1-based) and values as balances. This is not ideal because the positions should be 0-based for consistency with Python's indexing.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The balance is calculated correctly, but the dictionary is not updated in a way that maintains the correct balance for each position.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The dictionary is sorted based on the balance and position, but the sorting logic is incorrect. The problem requires sorting by balance in increasing order and by position in decreasing order for ties. The current sorting logic sorts by balance in increasing order and by position in increasing order, which is not correct.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The result string `ans` is constructed by appending characters from the sorted dictionary, but the positions in the dictionary are 1-based, which can lead to incorrect indexing.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance = 0
    positions = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        positions.append((balance, -i, s[i]))
    
    positions.sort()
    
    ans = ''.join(char for _, _, char in positions)
    return ans

n = input()
print(func_1(n))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - We maintain a running balance and store tuples of the form `(balance, -position, character)` in the `positions` list. The negative position ensures that ties are broken in decreasing order of position.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The `positions` list is sorted based on the balance and then by the negative position, which correctly implements the required sorting logic.

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The result string `ans` is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `positions` list.

This corrected program should correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.
