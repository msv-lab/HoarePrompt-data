The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The other variables `a`, `b`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, `results` is an empty list**
