Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `N` which represents the number of test cases. It then iterates `N` times, reading an integer `n` for each test case.

2. **Sum Calculation**: For each test case, the program iterates from 0 to `n-1` and calls `func_1(i)` to get the sum of the digits of `i`. It then adds this sum to the variable `soma`.

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of the integer `n` by converting `n` to a string, iterating over each character (digit), converting it back to an integer, and summing these integers.

4. **Output**: After processing all test cases, the program prints the total sum `soma`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Global Variable `soma`**: The variable `soma` is used to accumulate the sum across all test cases, which is incorrect. Each test case should have its own sum, and the results should be printed for each test case separately.

- **Range of Loop**: The loop `for i in range(n)` iterates from 0 to `n-1`, but the problem description specifies that the numbers on the board are from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the loop should be `for i in range(1, n+1)`.

- **Output for Each Test Case**: The program prints the total sum `soma` after processing all test cases, but it should print the sum for each test case immediately after calculating it.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
