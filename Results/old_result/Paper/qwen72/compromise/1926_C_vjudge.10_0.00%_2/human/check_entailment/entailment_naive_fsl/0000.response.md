Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the first line of input should contain the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line should contain a single integer `n` for each test case. The program, however, reads a single integer `N` and then iterates `N` times, reading an integer `n` and summing the results of `func_1(i)` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`. This means the program will only handle a single test case and will not reset the sum `soma` for each test case, leading to incorrect results for multiple test cases. Additionally, the function `func_1` should be applied to the range `1` to `n` (inclusive) rather than `0` to `n-1` (inclusive) to match the problem description.
