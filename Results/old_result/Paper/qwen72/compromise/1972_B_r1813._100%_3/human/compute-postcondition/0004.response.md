The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `n`, `s`, `input`, `data`, and `index` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
