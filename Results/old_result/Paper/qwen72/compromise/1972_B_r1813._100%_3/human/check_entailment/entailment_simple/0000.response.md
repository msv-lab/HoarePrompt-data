Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program iterates over each test case using a for loop. Inside the loop, it correctly extracts the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.

3. **Counting 'U' Coins**: The program counts the number of 'U' coins in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.

4. **Determining the Winner**: The program checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd. If it is, Alice wins, and the program prints 'YES'. If the count is even, Bob wins, and the program prints 'NO'.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge cases where there are no 'U' coins (player loses) and where there are only one or two coins left (as described in the problem statement).

6. **Optimal Play**: The logic of the program is based on the observation that if the number of 'U' coins is odd, Alice will always have a move available when it is her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left. Conversely, if the number of 'U' coins is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that Alice eventually runs out of moves.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of 'U' coins.

Correctness: **True**
