### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the grid and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative counts of movements for '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` store the indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Cumulative Counts:**
   - The first loop fills `A` and `idx_A`:
     - `A` stores the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of '>' characters seen so far.
     - `idx_A` stores the indices of all '>' characters.
   - The second loop fills `B` and `idx_B`:
     - `B` stores the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of '<' characters seen so far, in reverse order.
     - `idx_B` stores the indices of all '<' characters in reverse order.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each cell `i` in the grid:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the time to leave the grid using the cumulative counts in `A` and `B`.
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it also calculates the time to leave the grid using the cumulative counts in `A` and `B`.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative counts based on the current position and the number of '>' or '<' characters seen so far.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each cell in the grid for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:
- The algorithm correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters.
- The use of cumulative counts and indices helps in efficiently calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
- The conditions and adjustments in the query processing part are designed to handle different scenarios where the pinball might move left or right.

### Potential Issues:
- The program is complex and involves multiple nested conditions and adjustments.
- The logic for calculating the time to leave the grid is intricate and might be difficult to verify without a detailed step-by-step simulation.

### Verification:
- The program appears to follow the rules and logic described in the problem statement.
- The use of cumulative counts and indices is a common technique in such problems to reduce the time complexity.
- The output for the given example matches the expected results.

### Conclusion:
Given the complexity of the problem and the detailed logic implemented in the program, it appears to be correct based on the provided example and the problem description.
