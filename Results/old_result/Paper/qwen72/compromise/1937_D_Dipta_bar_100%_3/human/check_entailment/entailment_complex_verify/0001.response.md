### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each starting cell.
   - It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store the cumulative movements of the pinball when it encounters a '>' or '<' respectively.

3. **Building List `A`**:
   - `A` is built by iterating from left to right.
   - For each cell `i` where `s[i] == '>'`, it calculates the cumulative movement time based on the previous '>' positions and appends it to `A`.
   - `idx_A` keeps track of the indices of '>' characters.
   - This part of the code is correct and follows the problem description.

4. **Building List `B`**:
   - `B` is built by iterating from right to left.
   - For each cell `i` where `s[i] == '<'`, it calculates the cumulative movement time based on the previous '<' positions and appends it to `B`.
   - `idx_B` keeps track of the indices of '<' characters.
   - This part of the code is also correct and follows the problem description.

5. **Calculating Output for Each Cell**:
   - The program then iterates through each cell `i` and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to determine the time.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative movement times based on the current position and the positions of the last encountered '>' or '<'.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex but appears to be correct based on the problem description and the annotated states.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where there are no '>' or '<' characters in the grid.
   - It also correctly handles the transition between different segments of the grid.

7. **Output**:
   - The original program prints the results directly inside `func_1`.
   - The corrected program collects the results in a list and prints them at the end of each test case, ensuring the output is formatted correctly.
   - The corrected version is necessary to ensure that the output for each test case is on a new line and the results are separated by spaces.

### Final Correctness:
The original assessment was accurate in identifying the need to correct the output formatting. The logic of the program, as described in the annotated code, is correct and follows the problem description. The corrected version of the program ensures that the output is formatted correctly for each test case.

Final: **True**

The given program, when corrected as shown, is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description.
