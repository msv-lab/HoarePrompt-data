Output State: **`A` is a list where each element represents the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of '>' characters seen so far. `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`. `B` is an empty list. `idx_B` is an empty list.** 

The initial state is preserved, and the new variable `idx_B` is initialized as an empty list.
