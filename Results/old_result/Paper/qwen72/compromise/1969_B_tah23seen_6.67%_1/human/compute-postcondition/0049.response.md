Output State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, but with the characters at indices `left` and `right` swapped, `right` is an index such that `right < len(s)`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, and `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`**.
