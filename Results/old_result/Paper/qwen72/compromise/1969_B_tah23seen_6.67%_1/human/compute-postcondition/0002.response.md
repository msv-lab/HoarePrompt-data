The value of `i`, which is the first character of the binary string `sChar`, is appended to the list `s`. The list `s` was initially empty, so now it contains only the first character of `sChar`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2, `s` is a list containing the first character of `sChar`, `i` is the first character of `sChar`**
