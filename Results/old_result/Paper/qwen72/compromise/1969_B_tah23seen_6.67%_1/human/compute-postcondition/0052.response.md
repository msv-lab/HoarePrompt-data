To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

### Analysis:
- **`right < len(s)`**: This condition ensures that `right` is within the bounds of the list `s`. Given that `right` is already defined as an index such that `right < len(s)`, this part of the condition is satisfied.
- **`s[right] != '0'`**: This condition checks that the character at index `right` in the list `s` is not '0'. For the loop to execute, `s[right]` must be something other than '0'.

### Current State:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `right` is an index such that `right < len(s)`.
- `i` is the last character of `sChar`.
- `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`.

### Adjustment Needed:
- The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes is `s[right]`. Specifically, `s[right]` should not be '0' for the loop to execute.

### Conclusion:
Since `right` is already within the bounds of `s`, we only need to ensure that `s[right]` is not '0'. Therefore, the state of `s[right]` must be adjusted to any character other than '0'.

State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is an index such that `right < len(s)`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`, and `s[right]` must not be '0'**.
