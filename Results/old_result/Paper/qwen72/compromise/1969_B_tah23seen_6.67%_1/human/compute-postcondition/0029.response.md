Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, `sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to the length of `s`, `cost` is 0, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, and `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' is found.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has completed its execution, the variable `left` will either point to the first '1' in the list `s` or will be equal to the length of `s` if there is no '1' in the list. All other variables (`sChar`, `s`, `right`, `cost`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
