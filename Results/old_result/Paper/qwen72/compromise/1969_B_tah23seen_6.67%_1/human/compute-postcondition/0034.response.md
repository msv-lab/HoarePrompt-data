To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the loop head: `right < len(s)` and `s[right] != '0'`.

### Initial State Analysis:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `right` is the index being checked in the loop condition.
- `len(s)` is the length of the list `s`, which is the same as the length of `sChar`.
- The loop condition requires `right` to be less than `len(s)` and `s[right]` to be not equal to `'0'`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute, `right` must be less than `len(s)`.
- Additionally, `s[right]` must not be `'0'`.

### Given State:
- `i` is the last character of `sChar`.
- `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `s' or the length of `s` if no '1' is found.
- `cost` is either `right - left + 1` if a swap occurs, or 0 otherwise.

### Adjustments:
- Since `right` is not explicitly given, we need to ensure that `right` is a valid index within the bounds of `s` and that `s[right]` is not `'0'`.
- If `right` is already set to a valid index, no adjustment is needed for `right`.
- If `s[right]` is `'0'`, we need to adjust `right` to point to an index where `s[right]` is not `'0'`.

### Final State:
- Ensure `right` is a valid index and `s[right]` is not `'0'`.

Given the initial state, we can assume that `right` is initially set to a valid index (since the problem does not specify otherwise). Therefore, we need to ensure that `s[right]` is not `'0'`.

### Conclusion:
State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is a valid index in `s` such that `s[right]` is not `'0'`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, and `left` is the index of the first occurrence of '1' in `s` or the length of `s` if no '1' is found.**
