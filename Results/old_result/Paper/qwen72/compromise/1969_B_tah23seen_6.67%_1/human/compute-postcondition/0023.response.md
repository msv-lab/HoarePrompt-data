To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `left < len(s)`**
   - This condition ensures that the index `left` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - Given that `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar`, and `sChar` has a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `len(s)` is at least 2.
   - Therefore, `left` must be less than `len(s)` for the loop to execute.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != '1'`**
   - This condition ensures that the character at index `left` in the list `s` is not '1'.
   - Given that `s` contains characters from `sChar`, which is a binary string, `s[left]` can be either '0' or '1'.
   - For the loop to execute, `s[left]` must be '0'.

### Current State:
- `sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\).
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order.
- `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to the length of `s`.
- `cost` is 0.
- `i` is the last character of `sChar`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`left` must be less than `len(s)`**: Since `len(s)` is at least 2, `left` should be 0 (the first index of the list) to ensure the loop can start.
- **`s[left]` must be '0'**: To satisfy this condition, `s[0]` must be '0'. Given that `sChar` is a binary string, it is possible for `s[0]` to be '0'.

### Final State:
- `left` is 0.
- `s[0]` is '0'.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes the first time is:
State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to the length of `s`, `cost` is 0, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is 0, and `s[0]` is '0'**.
