Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most 2 * 10^5, `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `s[right]` is '1' while `s[left]` is '0', `cost` is 0, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `right` is incremented by 1, and `s[right]` must be '1'.**

Explanation: The value of `right` is incremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. The new value of `right` is one more than its previous value, and `s[right]` must still be '1'.
