To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition 1: `left < len(s)`**
   - This condition checks if `left` is within the bounds of the list `s`.
   - Given that `left < len(s)` is already part of the initial state (`left < len(s)`), this condition is satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left] != '1'`**
   - This condition checks if the character at index `left` in the list `s` is not '1'.
   - The initial state mentions that `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`. However, it does not specify the value of `s[left]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `s[left]` must not be '1'. If `s[left]` is '1', the loop will not execute.
- Since `s` is a list of characters from the binary string `sChar`, and `sChar` is a binary string, `s[left]` can either be '0' or '1'.
- To make sure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `s[left]` is '0'.

### Final State:
- The state needs to be adjusted so that `s[left]` is '0'.

State: **`sChar` remains a binary string with a length of at least 2 and at most \(2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a list containing all the characters of `sChar` in the same order, `right` is now the smallest index such that `s[right]` is '0' or `right` is equal to `len(s)`, `i` is the last character of `sChar`, `left` is an index such that `left <= right` and `left < len(s)`, and `s[left]` must be '0'**.
