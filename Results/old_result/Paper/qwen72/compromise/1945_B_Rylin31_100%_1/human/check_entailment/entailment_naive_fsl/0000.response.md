Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. The program simply adds the number of times each installation can launch fireworks within the visibility period `m` and adds 2, which is incorrect.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
- Input: `1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `4`
- Actual Output: `3`

The program outputs `3` because it calculates `1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2`, which is `3`. However, the correct output should be `4` because both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes (from `x` to `x + 1`). Therefore, at any given minute, there will be 2 fireworks from the first installation and 2 fireworks from the second installation visible, totaling 4 fireworks.

The correct approach should consider the overlap of the visibility periods of the fireworks launched by both installations. The program needs to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at any minute, taking into account the visibility duration `m + 1` and the launch frequencies `a` and `b`.
