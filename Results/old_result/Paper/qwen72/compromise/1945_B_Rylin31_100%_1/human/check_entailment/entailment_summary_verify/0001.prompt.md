You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        print(m // a + m // b + 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input, where `1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18`. The function then calculates the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case and prints the result. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have two installations that launch fireworks at regular intervals `a` and `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
   - To find the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks, we need to consider the overlap of visibility periods of fireworks from both installations.

3. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - For a given time `t`, the number of fireworks launched by the first installation up to time `t` is `t // a`.
   - The number of fireworks launched by the second installation up to time `t` is `t // b`.
   - The total number of fireworks visible at time `t` is the sum of the fireworks launched by both installations up to time `t` plus any additional fireworks that might be visible due to the overlap.

4. **Overlap Calculation:**
   - The overlap occurs when the visibility periods of fireworks from both installations intersect.
   - The visibility period of a firework launched at time `x` is `[x, x + m]`.
   - We need to find the maximum `t` such that the number of fireworks visible at `t` is maximized.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation up to time `m` using `m // a` and `m // b`.
   - It adds 2 to the result, which seems to be an attempt to account for the overlap.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program's logic of `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect.
   - The `+ 2` part is not justified and does not account for the actual overlap correctly.
   - The correct approach should consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap and then calculate the maximum number of simultaneous fireworks.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b` to find the time when both installations launch a firework simultaneously.
   - Determine the number of simultaneous launches within the visibility period `m + 1`.
   - Calculate the total number of fireworks visible at the time of maximum overlap.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect.
