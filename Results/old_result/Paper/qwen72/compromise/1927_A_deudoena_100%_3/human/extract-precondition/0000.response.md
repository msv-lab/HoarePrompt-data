Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in each string is black.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing `n` and `s` as described above.
