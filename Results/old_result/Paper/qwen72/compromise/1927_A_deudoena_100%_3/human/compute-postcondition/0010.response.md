The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in each string is black.

The function returns the difference between the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` and the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, the function returns 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the first 'B' in `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, it returns 2.**
