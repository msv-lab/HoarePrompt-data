Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.**

The code assigns the value of the element at the index `median_index` in the sorted list `arr` to the variable `current_median`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
