To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the program state:

### Loop Condition:
```
while heap[0] <= current_median:
```
- The loop will execute if the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.

### Program State:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `i` is 0
- `results` is an empty list
- `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`
- `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`
- `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end
- `operations` is 0

### Analysis:
- The loop condition depends on `heap[0]` and `current_median`.
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap.
- `current_median` is the element at the `median_index` of the sorted array `arr`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The heap is initialized with elements from `arr[median_index]` to the end of `arr`.
   - Since `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) will be `arr[median_index]`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `heap[0]` (which is `arr[median_index]`) is less than or equal to `current_median`.
   - Given that `current_median` is also `arr[median_index]`, the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` will always be true in the first iteration.

### Conclusion:
- No adjustments are needed to the program state for the loop to execute the first time because the condition `heap[0] <= current_median` will always be true given the current state.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[i]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[i]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, `operations` is 0**
