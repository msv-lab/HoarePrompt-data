The loop condition is `heap[0] <= current_median`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `heap[0]` must still be less than or equal to `current_median`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `heap[0]` is the smallest element in the heap, which is either the previously next smallest element or `smallest + 1` if it is smaller.
- `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`.

Since `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median` for the loop to execute again, and it was already adjusted to be less than or equal to `current_median` at the end of the last iteration, no further adjustment is needed for `heap[0]` or `current_median` to satisfy the loop condition.

Therefore, the state can remain the same for the next iteration to proceed.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the values of `operations` and the new value of `operations` appended, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing the elements of `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, except the smallest element which has been removed and the next smallest element which is now the smallest, `smallest` is the smallest element from the heap before the current operation, `operations` is 2, and the smallest element in the heap has been increased by 1, and `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. The value `smallest + 1` has been pushed into the heap, and `heap[0]` is now the smallest element in the heap, which is either the previously next smallest element or `smallest + 1` if it is smaller.**
