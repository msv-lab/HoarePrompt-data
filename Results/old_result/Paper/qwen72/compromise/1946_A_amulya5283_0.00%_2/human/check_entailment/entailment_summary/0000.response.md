Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the arrays for each test case.
   - This part of the program correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - This is necessary to determine the median of the array.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`.
   - This is correct for both odd and even lengths of the array, as the problem specifies the median as the element at index `ceil(n/2)`, which is equivalent to `n // 2` for 0-based indexing.

4. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the sorted array.
   - This is done to efficiently manage the elements that need to be increased to make the median larger.

5. **Operations Calculation**:
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment is counted as an operation.
   - The loop ensures that the smallest element in the heap is always the next candidate for incrementing, which is efficient and correct.

6. **Output**:
   - The results are collected in a list and printed one by one.
   - This matches the required output format.

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently, and the sorting step correctly identifies the median.

Correctness: **True**
