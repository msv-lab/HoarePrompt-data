### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the list. This part is correctly implemented and adheres to the problem's input format.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is necessary to determine the median, which is correctly identified as the element at index `n // 2` for odd `n` and the element at index `n // 2` for even `n` (since the problem specifies the median as the middle element in the sorted array).

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - The program initializes a min-heap with the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array. This is a good approach because the median is the middle element, and we need to focus on the elements that can potentially become the new median.

4. **Operations Calculation:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. Each increment is counted as an operation. This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

5. **Output:**
   - The program appends the number of operations required for each test case to the `results` list and prints the results. This is consistent with the problem's output requirements.

### Potential Issues:
- **Heap Initialization:**
  - The heap is initialized with elements starting from the median index to the end of the array. This is correct for odd `n`, but for even `n`, the median is the element at index `n // 2`, and the heap should include this element. However, the program correctly handles both cases by ensuring the heap contains the median and all elements to its right.

- **Heap Operations:**
  - The while loop ensures that the smallest element in the heap is incremented until it is greater than the current median. This is the correct approach to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array for each test case. The input handling, sorting, heap initialization, and operations calculation are all done correctly.
