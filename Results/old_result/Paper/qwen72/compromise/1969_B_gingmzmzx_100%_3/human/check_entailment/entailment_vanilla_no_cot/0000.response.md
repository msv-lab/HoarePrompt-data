Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the problem described. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **String Conversion**: The binary string is converted to a list of integers, which is a valid and efficient way to handle the string for the operations needed.
3. **Counting Zeroes**: The program counts the number of zeroes in the string, which is used to calculate the cost of shifting ones to the right.
4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program maintains a count of the number of zeroes and ones encountered so far in the `cnt` list.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is `0`, it adds 1 to the answer if there has been at least one `1` encountered before (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes that need to be shifted to the right of the current position to the answer.
5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

This approach ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly by considering the optimal way to shift substrings to achieve a sorted string. The logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.
