You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string s as input, where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and s consists only of '0's and '1's. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the last input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the last `s`, `cnt` is [number of zeros in the last `s`, number of ones in the last `s`], and `ans` is the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i]` is 0 and `s[j]` is 1, and `i < j` for the last input string.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a binary string `s` and processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it returns a result based on the input string `s`. The length of `s` is between 2 and 2 · 10^5, and `s` consists only of '0's and '1's. The function can handle up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of the lengths of all strings not exceeding 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
