Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the input string that must have at least 1 integer, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where the element at index `c` is incremented by 1, `c` is the first integer in the list `s`. If `c` is 0, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0. If `c` is not 0, `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]`.***
