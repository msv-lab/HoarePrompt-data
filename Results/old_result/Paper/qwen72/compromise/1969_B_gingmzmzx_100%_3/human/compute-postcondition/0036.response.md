Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers derived from the new input string that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element in `s`, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the new `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, and `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `c` is 0, and `ans` is `zeroes - cnt[0]` if `c` is not 0.**
