The function should take a binary string s as input, where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and s consists only of '0's and '1's. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
