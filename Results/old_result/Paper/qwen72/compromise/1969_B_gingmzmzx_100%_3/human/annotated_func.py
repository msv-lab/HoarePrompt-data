#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a binary string s as input, where 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5 and s consists only of '0's and '1's. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of the lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
        
        zeroes = s.count(0)
        
        cnt = [0, 0]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for c in s:
            cnt[c] += 1
            if c == 0:
                ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
            else:
                ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations, `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers derived from the last input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the last `s`, `cnt` is [number of zeros in the last `s`, number of ones in the last `s`], and `ans` is the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i]` is 0 and `s[j]` is 1, and `i < j` for the last input string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and calculates the total number of pairs `(i, j)` where `s[i]` is '0' and `s[j]` is '1', and `i < j`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes `n` being 0, `s` being the list of integers derived from the last input string, `zeroes` being the count of zeros in the last `s`, `cnt` being a list with the counts of zeros and ones in the last `s`, and `ans` being the total number of valid pairs for the last input string.
