The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract `t` test cases, each containing `n` integers from a list `a`. It applies `func_1` to each list `a` and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the last processed list, `a` is the last processed list of integers, `data` is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is the index after processing all test cases, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.
