### Reasoning:

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- **Logic**: The function `func_1(a)` checks if the array `a` can be sorted by concatenating a suffix and a prefix of the array. It does this by creating a concatenated version of the array `a + a` and then checking if any subarray of length `n` in this concatenated array matches the sorted version of the original array.
- **Correctness**: This approach is correct because if there exists a way to split the array into two parts and swap them to get a sorted array, then the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
- **Output**: The function collects the results of each test case and prints them in the required format.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Single Test Case**: The program handles a single test case correctly.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
- **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, the program will return "Yes" because the sorted array is a subarray of `a + a`.
- **Array with Duplicates**: The program handles arrays with duplicate elements correctly.
- **Array with Unique Elements**: The program handles arrays with unique elements correctly.
- **Array of Length 2**: The program handles arrays of length 2 correctly, as the only possible split and swap will either leave the array unchanged or reverse it, which will be sorted if the original array was sorted.
- **Array of Maximum Length (50)**: The program handles the maximum length of the array (50) correctly.

### Additional Considerations:
- **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough for the given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 2 ≤ n ≤ 50). The time complexity of `func_1` is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, and the overall complexity for `func_2` is O(t * n log n), which is manageable within the constraints.
- **Correctness of the Algorithm**: The algorithm used in `func_1` is fundamentally sound. By checking all possible splits and swaps, it ensures that any valid transformation that could result in a sorted array is considered.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly solves the problem by checking if the array can be sorted through the specified operation. The logic and implementation are sound, and the program handles all edge cases as described.

Final: **True**
