### Reasoning:

#### Function 1: `func_1(a)`
- **Logic**: The function `func_1(a)` checks if the array `a` can be sorted by concatenating a suffix and a prefix of the array. It does this by creating a concatenated version of the array `a + a` and then checking if any subarray of length `n` in this concatenated array matches the sorted version of the original array.
- **Correctness**: This approach is correct because if there exists a way to split the array into two parts and swap them to get a sorted array, then the sorted array must appear as a contiguous subarray in the concatenated array `a + a`.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input Handling**: The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases. It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1(a)` for each test case.
- **Output**: The function collects the results of each test case and prints them in the required format.

#### Edge Cases:
- **Single Test Case**: The program handles a single test case correctly.
- **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases.
- **Already Sorted Array**: If the array is already sorted, the program will return "Yes" because the sorted array is a subarray of `a + a`.
- **Array with Duplicates**: The program handles arrays with duplicate elements correctly.
- **Array with Unique Elements**: The program handles arrays with unique elements correctly.
- **Array of Length 2**: The program handles arrays of length 2 correctly, as the only possible split and swap will either leave the array unchanged or reverse it, which will be sorted if the original array was sorted.
- **Array of Maximum Length (50)**: The program handles the maximum length of the array (50) correctly.

#### Annotated Code Validation:
- **State Before Function Calls**: The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after key points in the code.
- **Function 1**: The function `func_1(a)` is correctly described. It checks if any segment of the concatenated array `a + a` matches the sorted version of `a`, which is the correct approach.
- **Function 2**: The function `func_2()` is correctly described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by performing the specified operation. The program handles all edge cases and input constraints as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
