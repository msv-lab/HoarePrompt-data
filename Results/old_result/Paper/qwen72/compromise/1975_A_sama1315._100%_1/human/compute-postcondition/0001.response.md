Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^6.
- The code `data = input().split()` reads a string from the standard input and splits it into a list of strings.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `data` is now a list of strings, each of which is a part of the input string split by whitespace.
