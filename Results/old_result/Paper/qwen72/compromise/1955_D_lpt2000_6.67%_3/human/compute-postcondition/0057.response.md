Postcondition: ***`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the third element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the third element of `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`. If `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`, `C[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 and `fnd` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is incremented by 1 and `fnd` remains unchanged. If `D[out_aa] > 0`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1. If `E[out_aa] <= 0` after the decrease, `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1, and `tot` is decreased by 1 for the key `out_aa`. If `tot >= k`, `fnd` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. If `D[out_aa] <= 0`, `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, but no changes are made to `C[out_aa]` or `tot`.***
