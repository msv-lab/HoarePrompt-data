Output State: **`nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `in_aa` is the second element of `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element of `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`. If `tot >= k`, then `fnd` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `fnd` remains unchanged. If `D[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `D[out_aa]` is reduced by 1 and `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `E[out_aa]` is greater than 0, `E[out_aa]` is decremented by 1. If `C[in_aa] > 0`, then `C[in_aa]` is increased by 1 if `C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]`; otherwise, `D[in_aa]` is increased by 1. If `C[in_aa]` is not greater than 0, then `E[in_aa]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tot = sum(D.values())` updates the value of `tot` to be the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
