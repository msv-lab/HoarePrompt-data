Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m + 1`, `in_aa` is the second element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the second element in `aa[:n - m]`, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`, `fnd` is incremented by 1 if `tot` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `fnd` remains unchanged, `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `C[out_aa]` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `aa`, `in_aa`, `out_aa`, `tot`, and `fnd` remain unchanged.
- The value of `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1, as stated in the initial conditions.
