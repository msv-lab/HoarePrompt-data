Output State: **`n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers with a length greater than `m`, `in_aa` is the first element in `aa[m:]`, `out_aa` is the first element in `aa[:n - m]`, the value of `C[in_aa]` is greater than 1, the value of `C[in_aa]` is equal to the value of `D[in_aa]` + 1, if `D[out_aa]` > 0, then: if `E[out_aa]` > 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1; if `E[out_aa]` <= 0, the value of `D[out_aa]` is decreased by 1 and the value of `C[out_aa]` is increased by 1. If `D[out_aa]` <= 0, the value of `E[out_aa]` is decreased by 1.**
