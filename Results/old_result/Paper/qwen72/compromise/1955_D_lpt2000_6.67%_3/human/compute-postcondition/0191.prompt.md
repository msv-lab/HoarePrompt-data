Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: n, m, and k, where n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Additionally, it should take two lists of integers, a and b, where a has n elements and b has m elements, and each element in a and b is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. `nabors` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(nabors):
    n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    aa = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    bb = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
    cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
    D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
    E = cnt_aa - D
    C = cnt_bb - D
    tot = sum(D.values())
    fnd = 1 if tot >= k else 0
    for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
        if D[out_aa] > 0:
            if E[out_aa] > 0:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            else:
                D[out_aa] -= 1
                C[out_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[out_aa] -= 1
        if C[in_aa] > 0:
            if C[in_aa] == D[in_aa]:
                C[in_aa] += 1
            else:
                D[in_aa] += 1
        else:
            E[in_aa] += 1
        tot = sum(D.values())
        fnd += 1 if tot >= k else 0
    print(fnd)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nabors` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` has at least `n` elements, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution, `C`, `D`, and `E` are updated based on the elements in `aa[m:]` and `aa[:n - m]` as per the loop logic.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nabors` is 0, `n` is greater than `m`, `aa` is a list of integers provided by the user with length greater than `m`, `tot` is the sum of all values in the dictionary `D`, `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop, `C` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb` that are not in `D`, `D` is the intersection of `cnt_aa` and `cnt_bb`, `E` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `aa[:m]` that are not in `D`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `bb` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt_aa` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa`, `cnt_bb` is a Counter object representing the frequency of elements in `bb`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop has completed all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `aa` and `bb` remain unchanged, `D` contains the updated frequencies of elements that are common between the first `m` elements of `aa` and `bb` after all iterations, `C` contains the updated frequencies of elements in `bb` that are not in `D` after all iterations, `E` contains the updated frequencies of elements in the first `m` elements of `aa` that are not in `D` after all iterations, `tot` is the sum of all values in `D`, and `fnd` is the total number of times `tot` was greater than or equal to `k` during the loop's execution.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
