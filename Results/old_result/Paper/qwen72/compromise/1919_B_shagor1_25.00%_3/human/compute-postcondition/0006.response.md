The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". The constraints are `1 <= t <= 1000` and `1 <= n <= 5000`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function evaluates the string `s` and returns a specific output based on the content of `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "+" and "-". The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the evaluation of the string `s`.**
