The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be a non-empty string. The variable `i` will take on the values of the characters in the string `s` during each iteration of the loop. The state of `t`, `test_cases`, and `neg` are not relevant to the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

Since the loop depends on `s` to have at least one character for it to execute, the state must ensure that `s` is not empty.

State: **`s` must be a non-empty string, `i` is the first character of the string `s`**
