#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". For each test case, `1 <= t <= 1000` and `1 <= n <= 5000`.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    neg = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '-':
            neg += 1
        
    #State: `neg` is the number of "-" characters in the string `s`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
    print(n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n)
    #This is printed: n - 2 * neg if n != neg else n (where n is the length of the string s and neg is the number of "-" characters in s)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from user input. It counts the number of "-" characters in `s` and prints the result of `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the printed result and the unchanged values of `n` and `s`.
