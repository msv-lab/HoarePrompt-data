Reasoning: The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '-' characters and uses this to compute the penalty, but it does not consider the actual splitting of the array as required by the problem statement.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, let's analyze the examples provided in the original assessment:

1. **Example 1:**
   ```
   1
   4
   ++--
   ```
   - The optimal way to split this string to minimize the penalty is `([1, 1, -1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `|1 + 1 - 1 - 1| * 4 = |0| * 4 = 0`.
   - The given program calculates `n - 2 * neg = 4 - 2 * 2 = 0`, which is correct in this specific case but does not generalize to all cases.

2. **Example 2:**
   ```
   1
   6
   +-+---
   ```
   - The optimal way to split this string to minimize the penalty is `([1, -1, 1], [-1, -1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `|1 - 1 + 1| * 3 + |-1 - 1 - 1| * 3 = |1| * 3 + |-3| * 3 = 3 + 9 = 12`.
   - The given program calculates `n - 2 * neg = 6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which is incorrect.

The program's logic of `n - 2 * neg` works only when the sum of the array is zero, which is not always the case. The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty, which involves more complex logic than just counting the number of '-' characters.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

Final: **False**
