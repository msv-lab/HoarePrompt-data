Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to split a string `s` of length `n` consisting of `+` and `-` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of `-` characters in `s` and stores it in `neg`.
   - It then calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Formula**:
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that each `+` contributes `1` to the sum and each `-` contributes `-1`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, it means there are some `+` characters in the string.
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to pair each `+` with a `-` as much as possible, which results in subarrays with a sum of `0` and a penalty of `0`.
   - The remaining characters (if any) will form subarrays with a penalty of `1` for each character.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` correctly accounts for the number of `+` and `-` pairs and the remaining characters.

4. **Special Case**:
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters.
   - In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to have each `-` in its own subarray, resulting in a penalty of `1` for each subarray.
   - Therefore, the total penalty is `n`.

5. **Testing the Solution**:
   - For the first test case: `s = "+"`, `n = 1`, `neg = 0`. The formula gives `1 - 2 * 0 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the second test case: `s = "-----"`, `n = 5`, `neg = 5`. The formula gives `5` because `n == neg`, which is correct.
   - For the third test case: `s = "+-+-+-"`, `n = 6`, `neg = 3`. The formula gives `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which is correct.
   - For the fourth test case: `s = "--+++++++-"`, `n = 10`, `neg = 2`. The formula gives `10 - 2 * 2 = 6`, but the correct answer should be `4` because we can split it into `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]` and `[1]`, resulting in a penalty of `4`.
   - For the fifth test case: `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`, `n = 20`, `neg = 8`. The formula gives `20 - 2 * 8 = 4`, which is correct.

6. **Challenging the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the solution is incorrect for the fourth test case.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` does not always correctly account for the optimal way to pair `+` and `-` characters to minimize the penalty.
   - Specifically, the formula fails when there are more `+` characters than `-` characters, but the optimal split involves creating subarrays that are not just pairs of `+` and `-`.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution provided is incorrect because it does not always find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

Final: **False**
