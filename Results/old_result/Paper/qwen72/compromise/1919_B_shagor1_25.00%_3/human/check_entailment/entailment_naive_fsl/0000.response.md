Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the optimal splitting of the array correctly to minimize the penalty. The function `func_1` simply calculates the number of '-' characters and uses this to compute the penalty, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty as described in the problem statement.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4
++--
```
The optimal way to split this string to minimize the penalty would be `([1, 1, -1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `0` (since the sum of the array is `0` and the length is `4`, so `|0| * 4 = 0`). However, the given program will output `4 - 2 * 2 = 0`, which is correct in this case, but it does not handle all cases correctly.

Another example where it fails:
```
1
6
+-+---
```
The optimal way to split this string to minimize the penalty would be `([1, -1, 1], [-1, -1, -1])`, which results in a penalty of `|1| * 3 + |-3| * 3 = 3 + 9 = 12`. However, the given program will output `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which is incorrect.

The program needs to consider the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty, which it does not do. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
