Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
   - Each character in `s` corresponds to an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
   - We need to split `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty of a subarray `c` is defined as `|sum(c)| * len(c)`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - It counts the number of `-` characters in `s` and stores it in `neg`.
   - It then calculates the penalty using the formula `n - 2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

3. **Evaluating the Formula**:
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` is derived from the observation that each `+` contributes `1` to the sum and each `-` contributes `-1`.
   - If `n` is not equal to `neg`, it means there are some `+` characters in the string.
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to pair each `+` with a `-` as much as possible, which results in subarrays with a sum of `0` and a penalty of `0`.
   - The remaining characters (if any) will form subarrays with a penalty of `1` for each character.
   - The formula `n - 2 * neg` accounts for the number of `+` and `-` pairs, and the remaining characters.

4. **Special Case**:
   - If `n` is equal to `neg`, it means the string consists entirely of `-` characters.
   - In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to have each `-` in its own subarray, resulting in a penalty of `1` for each subarray.
   - Therefore, the total penalty is `n`.

5. **Testing the Solution**:
   - For the first test case: `s = "+"`, `n = 1`, `neg = 0`. The formula gives `1 - 2 * 0 = 1`, which is correct.
   - For the second test case: `s = "-----"`, `n = 5`, `neg = 5`. The formula gives `5` because `n == neg`, which is correct.
   - For the third test case: `s = "+-+-+-"`, `n = 6`, `neg = 3`. The formula gives `6 - 2 * 3 = 0`, which is correct.
   - For the fourth test case: `s = "--+++++++-"`, `n = 10`, `neg = 2`. The formula gives `10 - 2 * 2 = 6`, but the correct answer should be `4` because we can split it into `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]` and `[1]`, resulting in a penalty of `4`.
   - For the fifth test case: `s = "+---++++-+++++---++-"`, `n = 20`, `neg = 8`. The formula gives `20 - 2 * 8 = 4`, which is correct.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The solution is incorrect for the fourth test case because it does not account for the optimal way to pair `+` and `-` characters to minimize the penalty. The formula `n - 2 * neg` works correctly only when the number of `+` and `-` characters can be perfectly paired, but it fails when there are more `+` characters than `-` characters or vice versa, and the optimal pairing is not straightforward.

Final: **False**
