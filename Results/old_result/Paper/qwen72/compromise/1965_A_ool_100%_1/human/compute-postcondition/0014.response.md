Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and determines the winner of a game based on the properties of the numbers in `arr`. The function returns 'Alice' if the smallest number in `arr` is not 1, or if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive unique numbers in the sorted list of `arr`. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob' if all unique numbers in `arr` are consecutive starting from 1. **
