Output State: **`arr` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr`.**

The `set_` list, which initially contained the unique elements of `arr` in an unspecified order, is now sorted in ascending order. The values of `arr` and `A` remain unchanged.
