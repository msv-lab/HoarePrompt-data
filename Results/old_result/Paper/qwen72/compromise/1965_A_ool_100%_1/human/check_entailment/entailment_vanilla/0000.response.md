### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of stones in each pile `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track whether Alice or Bob wins.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` using `set(arr)` and `sort()`.

3. **Initial Check:**
   - If the smallest pile size (i.e., `set_[0]`) is not 1, Alice wins immediately. This is because Alice can always choose `k = set_[0]` and empty all piles in one move.

4. **Iterate Through Unique Pile Sizes:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes starting from the second smallest.
   - If the difference between consecutive pile sizes is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop. This indicates that the pile sizes are not consecutive.
   - It toggles the value of `A` at each step, which simulates the turns of the players.

5. **Final Check:**
   - If `not_c` is `True` (i.e., all pile sizes are consecutive), it toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" otherwise.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: Smallest Pile Size is Not 1:**
  - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k = set_[0]` and emptying all piles in one move. This is correctly handled by the initial check.

- **Case 2: Smallest Pile Size is 1:**
  - If the smallest pile size is 1, the game becomes more complex. The key observation is that if the pile sizes are consecutive, the game can be reduced to a simpler form.
  - If the pile sizes are not consecutive, Alice can always win by choosing `k` such that it breaks the sequence, forcing Bob to lose in subsequent turns.
  - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the game can be reduced to a single pile of size 1, and the player who starts (Alice) will lose if the number of piles is even, and win if the number of piles is odd. This is because each player can only remove 1 stone from each pile, and the game will end when all piles are empty.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Use of `n`:**
  - The variable `n` is read as a list of integers, which is incorrect. It should be read as a single integer.
  - The correct way to read `n` is `n = int(input().rstrip())`.

- **Incorrect Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is called with `arr` as an argument, but the function itself is not defined in the provided code. This is a logical error.

### Corrected Program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    n = int(input().rstrip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if set_[0] != 1:
        return 'Alice'
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        A = not A
    if not_c:
        A = not A
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
```

### Correctness:

- **True** if the corrected program is used.
- **False** if the original program is used due to the issues mentioned.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False** (due to the issues in the original program)
