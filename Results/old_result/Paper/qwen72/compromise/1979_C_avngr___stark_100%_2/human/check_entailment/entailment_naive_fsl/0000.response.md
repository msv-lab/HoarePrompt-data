Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, but they do not address the problem of distributing coins to ensure a profit in any winning outcome.

To solve the problem, we need to find a way to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The provided program does not attempt to do this. Instead, it computes the LCM of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The correct output should be a distribution of coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any outcome. One valid solution could be:
```
27 41 12
```
However, the provided program does not produce any such distribution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
