### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the problem to see if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has a list of multipliers `k` for each outcome.
2. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output a list of bets `x` such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
   - If no such distribution exists, output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **func_1(a, b):**
   - This function computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It uses the formula: `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.

2. **func_2(numbers):**
   - This function computes the LCM of a list of integers by repeatedly applying `func_1`.
   - It starts with the first number in the list and iteratively applies `func_1` to the current result and the next number in the list.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
   - It computes the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then creates a list of bets `c` where each bet is `m // k[i]`, where `m` is the LCM.
   - It checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

#### Key Points:
- **LCM Calculation:**
  - The LCM of the multipliers ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total bet is a multiple of the LCM.
  - This is a valid approach because the LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers.

- **Bet Distribution:**
  - The bets are calculated as `m // k[i]`, which ensures that the return for each outcome is `k[i] * (m // k[i]) = m`.
  - The sum of the bets is `sum(c)`, and the program checks if this sum is less than `m`.

- **Profit Condition:**
  - The program ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM, which means the return for any winning outcome will be `m`, which is greater than the total bet.
  - This satisfies the condition that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

#### Example Test Case:
- **Test Case:**
  ```
  3
  3 2 7
  ```
- **Program Execution:**
  - `k = [3, 2, 7]`
  - `m = LCM(3, 2, 7) = 42`
  - `c = [42 // 3, 42 // 2, 42 // 7] = [14, 21, 6]`
  - `sum(c) = 14 + 21 + 6 = 41`
  - Since `41 < 42`, the program prints `14 21 6`.

- **Verification:**
  - If the first outcome wins, the return is `3 * 14 = 42`.
  - If the second outcome wins, the return is `2 * 21 = 42`.
  - If the third outcome wins, the return is `7 * 6 = 42`.
  - In all cases, the return is `42`, which is greater than the total bet of `41`.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers and distributes the bets in such a way that the total bet is strictly less than the LCM. This ensures that the return for any winning outcome is greater than the total bet, satisfying the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**. The given program is correct.
