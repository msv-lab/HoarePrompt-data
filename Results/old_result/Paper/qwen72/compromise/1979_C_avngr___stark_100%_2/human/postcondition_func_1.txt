The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty list of integers `numbers` and returns a single integer that is the result of repeatedly applying the function `func_1` to all integers in the list, starting with the first integer. The final state of the program is that the returned integer is the cumulative result of the `func_1` applications on the list elements.
