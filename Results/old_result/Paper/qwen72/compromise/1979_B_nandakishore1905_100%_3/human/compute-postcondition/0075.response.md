Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and must not be a power of 2 plus \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `p` is the length of the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is \(k - 2^p\) and must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.**

The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `f` to its binary representation, removes the '0b' prefix, and assigns the result to `l`. The binary representation of `f` is now stored in `l` without the '0b' prefix. The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `p`, `q`, and `f` remain unchanged.
