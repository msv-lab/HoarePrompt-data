Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`.** 

The values of `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the input integers greater than 0. The value of `k` is calculated as the absolute difference between the new values of `n` and `m`. No additional changes are made to `l`, `p`, `f`, or `q` as the code snippet provided only updates `n` and `m`.
