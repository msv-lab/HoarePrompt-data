Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `p = len(l)` assigns the length of the string `l` to the variable `p`.
- `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, so `p` will be the number of bits in this binary representation.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The output state includes all the initial conditions and the new value of `p`.
