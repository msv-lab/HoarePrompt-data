You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of length 2n. For each test case, it processes the list `a` to find and print pairs of elements from the first half and the second half of `a` such that the total number of printed elements from the first half is `2k` and the total number of printed elements from the second half is also `2k`. The function ensures that the bitwise XOR of the printed elements from the first half is equal to the bitwise XOR of the printed elements from the second half. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final output is printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` to keep track of the counts of each element in the first half and the second half of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to zero. These variables are used to keep track of the number of elements selected for the arrays `l` and `r`.

3. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program counts the occurrences of each element in the first half of the array `a` and stores these counts in `l`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each element in the second half of the array `a` and stores these counts in `r`.

4. **Selecting Elements for `l`:**
   - The program iterates through the first half of the array `a` and selects elements that appear twice in `l`.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count in `l` to zero.
   - It also increments `ul` by 2 for each pair of elements selected.
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, the loop breaks.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`:**
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, the program selects elements that appear once in `l`.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count in `l` to zero.
   - It also increments `re` and appends the selected elements to the list `res`.

6. **Selecting Elements for `r`:**
   - The program prints the elements stored in `res` (which are the remaining elements needed to complete `l`).
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it iterates through the second half of the array `a` and selects elements that appear twice in `r`.
   - It prints these elements and updates the count in `r` to zero.
   - It also increments `ur` by 2 for each pair of elements selected.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop breaks.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Incorrect Array Initialization and Usage:**
   - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized to have a length of `n`, but they are used as counters for elements in the array `a`. This is incorrect because the indices of `l` and `r` should correspond to the elements in `a` (which range from 0 to `n-1`), not the positions in `a`.
   - The correct initialization should be `l = [0] * n` and `r = [0] * n`.

2. **Incorrect Element Selection Logic:**
   - The program attempts to select elements for `l` and `r` based on the counts in `l` and `r`, but it does not correctly handle the selection of elements from the second half of the array `a` to form `r`.
   - The logic for selecting elements for `r` is flawed. It should select elements from the second half of the array `a` that match the elements selected for `l`.

3. **Incorrect XOR Calculation:**
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the XOR of the selected elements to ensure that the XOR of `l` is equal to the XOR of `r`. This is a critical part of the problem, and the program should verify this condition.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the elements of `l` and `r` directly, but it does not ensure that the output format matches the required format (two lines of `2k` elements each).

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for selecting elements and ensuring the XOR condition is flawed, and the output format is not guaranteed to be correct.

Correctness: **False**
