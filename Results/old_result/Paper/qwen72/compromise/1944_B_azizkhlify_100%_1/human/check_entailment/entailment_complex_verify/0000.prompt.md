You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 5 · 10^4, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. Additionally, it should take a list `a` of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice. The function should return two lists `l` and `r`, each of length 2k, where `l` is a subset of the first half of `a` and `r` is a subset of the second half of `a`, and the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `res` is a list containing the elements that were printed in the second part of the output for each iteration, `n` and `k` are the values provided in the input, `a` is the list of integers read from the input, `l` is a list of `n` integers representing the count of each element in the first half of `a` after processing, `r` is a list of `n` integers representing the count of each element in the second half of `a` after processing, `ul` is the total number of elements from the first half of `a` that were processed and printed, and `ur` is the total number of elements from the second half of `a` that were processed and printed. The loop has printed all required elements and the final output is complete.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of length 2n. For each test case, it processes the list `a` to find and print pairs of elements from the first half and the second half of `a` such that the total number of printed elements from the first half is `2k` and the total number of printed elements from the second half is also `2k`. The function ensures that the bitwise XOR of the printed elements from the first half is equal to the bitwise XOR of the printed elements from the second half. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final output is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly handling all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Usage of `l` and `r` Arrays**:
   - The arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with a length of `n`, but they should be initialized with a length of `2k` to store the required subsets.
   - The program incorrectly uses `l` and `r` to count occurrences of elements in the first and second halves of the array `a`, respectively. This is not necessary and can lead to confusion.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Subsets**:
   - The program attempts to print elements directly from the input array `a` without ensuring that the subsets `l` and `r` are of length `2k`.
   - The logic for selecting elements to form the subsets `l` and `r` is flawed. It does not guarantee that the subsets will have the same length or that the XOR of elements in `l` will match the XOR of elements in `r`.

3. **Incorrect XOR Calculation**:
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the XOR of elements in the subsets `l` and `r` to ensure they are equal. Instead, it relies on the order of elements in the input array, which is not a reliable method.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is close to `n/2` or where the input array has a specific structure that could cause issues.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1 2 3 4
1 2
```

In this example, the program does not correctly form the subsets `l` and `r` of length `2k` (which is 4 in this case) and does not ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` matches the XOR of elements in `r`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
