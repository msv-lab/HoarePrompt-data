Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `ul` is either unchanged or increased by 2 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2.
- `l[a[j] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2.
- If `ul` reaches `k * 2` at any point, the loop breaks, and `i` will be the index at which this condition was met.
- `k` is now `2 * k - ul`, and `k` is non-zero.
- Additionally, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `ul` and `l`**:
   - `ul` is a variable that is either unchanged or increased by 2 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2.
   - `l[a[j] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2.
   - This means that `ul` is tracking how many times `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2, and each time it is 2, it is reset to 0.

2. **Breaking the Loop**:
   - The loop breaks when `ul` reaches `k * 2`.
   - `i` is the index at which this condition was met.

3. **Final State of `k`**:
   - After the loop breaks, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`.
   - Since `k` is non-zero, `2 * k - ul` must also be non-zero.

4. **Value of `l[a[i] - 1]`**:
   - After the loop, `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

5. **Value of `a[i]`**:
   - The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the value of `a[i]`.
   - Since `i` is the index at which `ul` reached `k * 2`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `a[i]` must be such that `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.

### Conclusion:
- The value of `a[i]` is the element in the list `a` at the index `i` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1.
- Since `i` is the index at which `ul` reached `k * 2`, and `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, the exact value of `a[i]` depends on the specific values in `a` and `l`.

### Output:
Output: **a[i] (where a[i] is the element in the list `a` at the index `i` where `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1)**
