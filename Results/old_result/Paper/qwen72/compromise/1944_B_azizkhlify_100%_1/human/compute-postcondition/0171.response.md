To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ul` is either unchanged or increased by 2 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2.
   - `l[a[j] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2.
   - If `ul` reaches `k * 2` at any point, the loop breaks, and `i` will be the index at which this condition was met.
   - `k` is now `2 * k - ul`, and `k` is non-zero.
   - If `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, `re` is incremented by 1, and `res` is a list that now includes the element `a[1]`.
   - If `re` is equal to `k`, the loop or if statement we were directly inside is broken, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `l` is a list of integers.
   - `ul` is a variable that tracks the number of times `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2.
   - `k` is a variable that is adjusted based on the value of `ul`.
   - `re` is a variable that tracks the number of times `l[a[1] - 1]` was 1.
   - `res` is a list that includes elements from `a` based on certain conditions.

3. **Execution of the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a`.
   - Given that `i` is 2, the statement will print `a[2]`.

4. **Determining the Value of `a[2]`:**
   - The value of `a[2]` is not explicitly provided in the initial state.
   - However, we know that `i` is 2, and the print statement will output the third element of the list `a`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `a[2]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list `a`)**
