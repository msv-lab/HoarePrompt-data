The code snippet provided is:
```
print(i, end=' ')
```

Based on the initial state:
- `res` is a list that must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the first element in `res`.

When the `print` statement is executed, it will print the value of `i` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

Since `i` is the first element in `res`, the output will be the value of the first element in `res` followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where [i] is the first element of the list `res`)**
