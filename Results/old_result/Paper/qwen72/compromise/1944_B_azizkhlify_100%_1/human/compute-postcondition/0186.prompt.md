Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is the index where `re` equals `k` or `n` if `re` never equals `k`, `ul` is either unchanged or increased by 2 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2, and `l[a[j] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2. If `ul` reaches `k * 2` at any point, the loop breaks, and `i` will be the index at which this condition was met. `k` is now `2 * k - ul`, and if the initial `k` was non-zero, `res` is a list that includes all elements `a[j]` for which `l[a[j] - 1]` was 1, up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop completes. If the initial `k` was zero, the program fragment does not execute, and the variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is a non-empty list, `i` is the first element of `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is a non-empty list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is a non-empty list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
