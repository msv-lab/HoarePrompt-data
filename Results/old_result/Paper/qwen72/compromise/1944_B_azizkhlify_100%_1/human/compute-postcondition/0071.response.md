Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is a placeholder, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of length `n` with elements at indices `a[j] - 1` set to 0 if they were 2 during the loop execution, otherwise they remain unchanged, `r` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is the total number of times an element in `l` was 1 and was printed, `ul` is the total number of times an element in `l` was 2 and was reset to 0, `ur` is 0, `res` contains all elements of `a` that were printed because `l[a[j] - 1]` was 1, and if `re` is equal to `k`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
