Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing all the elements of `a` (from the first `n` elements) for which `l[a[j] - 1]` was 1, up to the point where `re` equals `k` if `k` is not zero. `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` integers where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`) is incremented by 1, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` remains 0, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, and `i` is the last element in `res` if the loop did not break, or the index at which the loop broke if `k` became zero. Additionally, `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n`, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` is 0 or 2, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 1`, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` is 0 or 2, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers read from the input, `res` is a list containing elements from `a` based on certain conditions, `n` is greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is `n + 2`, `ul` is the total number of elements in `a` (from the first `n` elements) that were equal to 2 in `l` and were reset to 0, `ur` is 0 or 2, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
