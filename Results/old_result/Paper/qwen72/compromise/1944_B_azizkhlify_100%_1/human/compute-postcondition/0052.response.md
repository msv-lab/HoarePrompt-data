Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `k` is `2 * k - ul`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is a list of length `n` with elements at indices `a[j] - 1` set to 0 if they were 2 during the loop execution, otherwise they remain unchanged, `r` is a list of length `n` with the element at index `a[j] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from `n` to `2 * n - 1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is the total number of times an element in `l` was 2 and was reset to 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, then `re` is 1 and `res` contains the first element of `a`.***
