Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `ul` is either unchanged or increased by 2 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2, and `l[a[j] - 1]` is set to 0 for each `j` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[j] - 1]` was 2. If `ul` reaches `k * 2` at any point, the loop breaks, and `i` will be the index at which this condition was met. `k` is now `2 * k - ul`, and `k` is non-zero. If `l[a[1] - 1]` is 1, `re` is incremented by 1, and `res` is a list that now includes the element `a[1]`. If `re` is equal to `k`, the loop or if statement we were directly inside is broken, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
