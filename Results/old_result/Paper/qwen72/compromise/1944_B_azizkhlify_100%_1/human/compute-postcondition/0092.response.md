Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0, `ur` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r[a[i] - 1] = 0` sets the value of `r[a[i] - 1]` to 0. The initial state indicates that `r[a[i] - 1]` could be either 2 or remain unchanged, but after the assignment, it is now 0. The condition for updating `ur` (i.e., if `ul` is equal to `ur`, then `ur` is increased by 2 if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2) is not affected by this assignment, so `ur` remains unchanged. The values of `n` and `i` are not modified by the code, so they retain their initial values.
