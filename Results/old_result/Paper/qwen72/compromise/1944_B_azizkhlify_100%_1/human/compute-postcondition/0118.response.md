The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2. For the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `l[a[0] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `l[a[1] - 1]` is incremented by 1**
