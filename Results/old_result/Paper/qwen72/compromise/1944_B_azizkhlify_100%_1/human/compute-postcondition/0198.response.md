Let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state step by step:

### Initial State:
- `res` is a non-empty list.
- `ul` and `ur` are not equal.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n + 1`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `a`**: The code snippet refers to a list `a`, but the initial state does not provide any information about `a`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact values of `a[i]` without additional information about `a`.

2. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is defined as `n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 1 (i.e., `i >= 1`).

3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Since the exact values of `a` and `a[i]` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe the output in terms of the given variables.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the value at index i in the list a, and i is n + 1, with n being greater than 0)**
