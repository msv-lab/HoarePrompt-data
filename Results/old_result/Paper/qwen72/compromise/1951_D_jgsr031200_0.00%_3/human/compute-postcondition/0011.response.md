Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and n is not equal to k. Additionally, n is greater than or equal to k. `costs` is a list with two elements: [n - k + 1, 1]. `h` is 0.**

The variable `h` is initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
