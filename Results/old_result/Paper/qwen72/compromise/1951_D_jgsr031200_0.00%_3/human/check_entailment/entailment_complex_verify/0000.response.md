### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Assessment of the Problem Description:**
   - The problem requires setting up at most 60 stalls with prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - Alice buys greedily from each stall, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.

2. **Analysis of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of coins Alice has) and `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - The function `func_1` is called with `n` and `k`.

3. **Detailed Function Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `n == k`**
     - If Alice has exactly `k` coins, the program correctly prints 'YES', 1, and 1. This is because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - **Case 2: `n < k`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, the program correctly prints 'NO' and returns. This is because it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins.
   - **Case 3: `n > k`**
     - The program calculates `costs` as `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
     - It then iterates over `costs` and calculates `h` as the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
     - The program checks if `h` is less than `k` and prints 'NO' if true, otherwise it prints '2', 'YES', and the values in `costs`.

4. **Flaw in the Logic:**
   - The logic for setting up the stalls and their prices is flawed. Specifically, the program always sets up two stalls with prices `[n - k + 1, 1]`.
   - This setup does not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. For example, in the test case `10 3`:
     - `costs` is `[10 - 3 + 1, 1] = [8, 1]`.
     - `h` is calculated as `10 // 8 + 10 // 1 = 1 + 10 = 11`.
     - Since `h` is greater than `k`, the program prints '2', 'YES', and `8 1`.
     - However, Alice will buy 1 jewel from the first stall (leaving her with 2 coins) and 2 jewels from the second stall (leaving her with 0 coins), resulting in a total of 3 jewels, which is correct.
   - The issue is that the program does not correctly handle all cases where `n > k` and `k` is not a simple multiple of `n`.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, Bob can set up `k` stalls, each priced at 1 coin per jewel. This will always ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, as long as `n >= k`.
   - If `k` is greater than 60, it is impossible to set up the required number of stalls, and the program should print 'NO'.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, especially when `n` is much larger than `k` and `k` is not a simple multiple of `n`.
   - The program should be modified to handle the case where `k` is greater than 60 and to ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up `k` stalls, each priced at 1 coin per jewel.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
