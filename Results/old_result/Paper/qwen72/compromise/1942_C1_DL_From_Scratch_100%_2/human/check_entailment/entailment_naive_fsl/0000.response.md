Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are such that the polygon can be divided into more than `x - 2` triangles. The program only counts the number of adjacent chosen vertices and adds `x - 2` to it, which is not always the correct approach.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6 3 0
1 3 5
```
The vertices chosen by Bessie are 1, 3, and 5. The program will output:
```
2
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
3
```
This is because the vertices 1, 3, and 5 can form three non-intersecting triangles: (1, 3, 5), (1, 3, 2), and (1, 5, 6). The program fails to account for these additional triangles, leading to an incorrect result.
