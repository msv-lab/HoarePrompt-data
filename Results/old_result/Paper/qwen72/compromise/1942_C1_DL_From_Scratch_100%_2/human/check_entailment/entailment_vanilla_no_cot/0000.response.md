Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The program attempts to count the number of triangles by looking at the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and checking if the gap is 1. However, this approach is flawed because it only counts the number of gaps of size 1, which is not the correct way to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces.
   - The correct approach involves understanding that each chosen vertex can potentially form a triangle with its adjacent vertices. The number of triangles that can be formed is related to the number of chosen vertices and the structure of the polygon.

2. **Handling the Last Gap:**
   - The program calculates the gap between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list, but it does so incorrectly. The formula `num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1` is not the correct way to calculate the gap between the last and the first vertex. It should be `num = (list0[0] - list0[-1] - 1) % n`.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - The final output `print(count + x - 2)` is incorrect. The number of triangles that can be formed is not simply the sum of the number of gaps of size 1 and `x - 2`. The correct formula to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is more complex and involves the number of chosen vertices and the structure of the polygon.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

- **Number of Triangles:**
  - For a regular polygon with \( n \) sides and \( x \) chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is \( x - 2 \). This is because each triangle is formed by three vertices, and the chosen vertices can form a triangulation of the polygon.

- **No Additional Vertices:**
  - Since \( y = 0 \), you cannot choose any additional vertices. Therefore, the number of triangles is solely determined by the \( x \) chosen vertices.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        print(x - 2)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out based on the chosen vertices.
