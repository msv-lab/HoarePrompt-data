The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range produced by `range(int(input()))`. For the loop to execute, the range must have at least one value, which means `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `p` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct

None of these variables are directly involved in the loop head. The loop will execute based on the user input, which is converted to an integer and used to determine the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the user input must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
