You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i <= n - 1:
            if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                j = 1
                break
            i += 1
        if j == 0:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers from the input. It then checks if there exists an index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. If such an index is found, it prints `2` and moves to the next test case. If no such index is found, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, and the input list `l` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both they and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The best friend of the i-th friend is given by `p_i`.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution iterates through the list `l` which represents the best friends of each friend.
   - It checks if `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` for any `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.
   - If this condition is met, it prints `2` and sets `j` to `1` to indicate that a valid pair has been found.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Identifying Flaws:**
   - The condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1` is not a general solution to the problem. It only checks for a specific pattern where the best friends are consecutive in the list.
   - This condition does not account for all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party with the minimum number of invitations.
   - For example, if the best friends form a cycle of length 2 (like `[2, 1]`), the solution should print `2` but it might not if the cycle is not at the end of the list.
   - The solution also does not handle cases where the best friends form a cycle of length greater than 2 or where there are multiple cycles.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships.
   - If there is a cycle of length 2, we can invite both friends in the cycle to ensure they both come.
   - If there is a cycle of length greater than 2, we need to invite at least one friend from each cycle to ensure at least 2 friends come.
   - If there are no cycles of length 2, we need to invite at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 come, as inviting 2 friends might not guarantee that both will come.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks for a specific pattern and does not handle all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can come to the party with the minimum number of invitations.

### Correctness:
**False**
