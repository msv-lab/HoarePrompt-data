Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l < n + 1`. Additionally, either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
