Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 1`.
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l < n + 1`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `v` is determined based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is 3, `v` will be 1 because there is no condition where `v` equals `n` (as `n` is not specified to be 3).
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. The function `func_2()` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `l` must be less than `n + 1`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)`.
   - We need to substitute the values of `l`, `i`, and `v` into this statement.

4. **Substituting Values:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `v` is 1.
   - `i * v` is \( 3 * 1 = 3 \).

5. **Final Output:**
   - The value of `l` is `func_2() + 1`, but since `func_2()` is not defined, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we know that `l` is some integer less than `n + 1`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? [l] 3 (where [l] is the value of `func_2() + 1` and is less than `n + 1`)**
