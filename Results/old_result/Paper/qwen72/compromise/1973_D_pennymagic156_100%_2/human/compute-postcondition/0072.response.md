To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

The loop condition is `while cnt and l < n + 1:`. This means the loop will continue as long as both `cnt` is non-zero and `l` is less than `n + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 1`.
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 3.
- `cnt` is `k - 2`.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `l < n + 1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Condition `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `cnt` must be non-zero.
   - Since `k > 1`, `k - 2` can be zero if `k = 2`, but since `k > 1`, `k` can be 2 or greater. Therefore, `cnt` is non-zero as long as `k > 2`.

2. **Condition `l < n + 1`:**
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute again, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Given `l < n + 1`, this condition is already satisfied.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`cnt`**: The value of `cnt` should remain non-zero. Since `cnt` is `k - 2`, and `k > 1`, `cnt` will be non-zero as long as `k > 2`.
- **`l`**: The value of `l` should remain less than `n + 1`. This condition is already satisfied.

Since both conditions are already met, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 1`, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 3, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and `l < n + 1`**.
