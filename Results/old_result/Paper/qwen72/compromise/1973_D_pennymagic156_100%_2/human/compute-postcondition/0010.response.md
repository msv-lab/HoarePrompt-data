Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `v` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- If `v` equals `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is `n-1`.

2. **Expression `i * n`**:
   - Substituting `i` with `n-1`, we get:
     \[
     i * n = (n-1) * n
     \]

3. **Formatted String**:
   - The print statement uses an f-string to format the output.
   - The string to be printed is `? 1 (n-1) * n`.

### Final Output:
- The value of `i` is `n-1`.
- The value of `i * n` is `(n-1) * n`.
- Therefore, the print statement will output:
  \[
  ? 1 (n-1) * n
  \]

### Example:
- If `n` is 5, then `i` is `4` and `i * n` is `4 * 5 = 20`.
- The output would be:
  \[
  ? 1 20
  \]

### General Case:
- For any given `n`, the output will be:
  \[
  ? 1 (n-1) * n
  \]

### Final Answer:
Output: **? 1 (n-1) * n (where n is the value of n and (n-1) * n is the product of (n-1) and n)**
