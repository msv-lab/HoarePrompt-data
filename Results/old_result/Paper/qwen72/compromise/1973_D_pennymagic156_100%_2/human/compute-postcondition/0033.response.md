To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \) and `k > 2`.
   - `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1` and `func_2() < n`.

2. **Variables in the Print Statement:**
   - `l`: This is `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`, `l` will be a value between 1 and `n`.
   - `i`: This is explicitly given as 1.
   - `v`: This is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists. Given that `i` is 1, `v` will be 1 because there is no other value of `i` that satisfies the condition `v == n`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

Given the above information:
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` returns a value less than `n`.
- `i` is 1.
- `v` is 1.

Therefore, the expression `i * v` evaluates to `1 * 1 = 1`.

So, the print statement will output:
```
? [l] 1
```
where `[l]` is the value of `func_2() + 1`.

Output: **? [l] 1 (where [l] is the value of `func_2() + 1` and `func_2()` is a value less than `n`)**
