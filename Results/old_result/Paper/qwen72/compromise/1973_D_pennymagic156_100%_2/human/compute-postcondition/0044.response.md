To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute at least once, let's analyze the conditions in the loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Variables in the Loop Head:
- `cnt`: This variable must be non-zero for the loop to execute.
- `l`: This variable must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 2.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **`cnt` Condition**:
   - `cnt` is initially set to `k`, and since \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), `cnt` is guaranteed to be a positive integer (non-zero).

2. **`l` Condition**:
   - `l` is initially set to 1.
   - For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer and `l` is 1, `l` is always less than `n + 1` (because \( 1 < n + 1 \)).

### Conclusion:
Both conditions (`cnt` being non-zero and `l` being less than `n + 1`) are already satisfied with the given initial state. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute at least once.

### Final State:
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**.
