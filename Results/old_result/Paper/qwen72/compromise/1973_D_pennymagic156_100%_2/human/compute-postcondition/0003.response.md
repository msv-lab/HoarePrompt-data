Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- `v` is 1.
- `i` is `n`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(f'? 1 {i * n}', flush=True)
```

Let's break down the values used in the print statement:

- `i` is `n`.
- Therefore, `i * n` is `n * n`.

So, the print statement will output:
- The string `? 1` followed by the value of `n * n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\), the value of `n * n` will be the square of `n`.

Thus, the output will be:
Output: **? 1 [n * n] (where n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4)**
