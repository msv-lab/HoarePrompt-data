Functionality: ** The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters directly but operates with two positive integers `n` and `k` (where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4) obtained from the function `func_3`. It does not return any value. The function performs a series of queries and prints specific outputs based on the results of these queries. If a condition is met, it prints `! {i * v}`, where `i` is the last value of `i` before the loop terminates, and `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists. If the condition is not met, it prints `! -1`. **
