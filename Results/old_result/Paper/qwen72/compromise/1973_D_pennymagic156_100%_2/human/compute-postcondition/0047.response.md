The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1. Since `cnt` was initially equal to `k`, after the decrement, `cnt` is now `k - 1`. The values of `n`, `v`, `i`, and `l` remain unchanged. The condition that either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1` still holds true because `cnt` is now `k - 1`, which is still a positive integer (since `k` is a positive integer and `k >= 1`).

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \), `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `k - 1`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
