The code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` by calling the function `func_3()`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are positive integers with the condition 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and assuming `func_3()` returns two values that also satisfy these conditions, the new values of `n` and `k` will be whatever `func_3()` returns, while still adhering to the same constraints.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, with their specific values determined by the return of `func_3()`.**
