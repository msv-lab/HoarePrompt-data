Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^4 \).
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
- `i` is 1.
- `cnt` is `k`.
- `l` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Value of `l`:**
   - `l` is explicitly given as 1.

2. **Value of `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 1.

3. **Value of `v`:**
   - According to the initial state, `v` is the value of `i` when `v` equals `n` or 1 if no such `i` exists.
   - Since `i` is 1, and there is no condition that specifies `v` should be `n`, `v` will be 1.

4. **Expression `i * v`:**
   - `i` is 1 and `v` is 1.
   - Therefore, `i * v` is \( 1 * 1 = 1 \).

### Final Output:
The print statement will print the formatted string with the values of `l` and `i * v`.

Output: **? 1 1**
