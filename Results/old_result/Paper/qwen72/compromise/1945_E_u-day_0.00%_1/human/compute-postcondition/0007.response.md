To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `low + 1 < high`.

Given the program state right before the loop:
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1`.
- `st` is an empty set.

We need to adjust the states of `low` and `high` to satisfy the condition `low + 1 < high`.

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.

2. **Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute if `low + 1 < high`.
   - Substituting the initial values, the condition becomes `0 + 1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `1 < n - 1` or `n > 2`.

### Conclusion:
- For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 2. This ensures that `high` is at least 2, and thus `low + 1` (which is 1) will be less than `high`.

### Adjusted State:
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 2.
- `st` is an empty set.

State: **`pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`; `low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1` where `n` must be greater than 2; `st` is an empty set.**
