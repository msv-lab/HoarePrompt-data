Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each of the `t` testcases, there are four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` such that -1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

### Code Analysis:
1. `n = int(input())` - `n` is assigned the value of an integer input.
2. `while n:` - The loop runs as long as `n` is not zero.
3. Inside the loop:
   - `l = int(input())` - `l` is assigned the value of an integer input.
   - `s = 0` - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `s += (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2` - `s` is updated based on the value of `l`.
   - `print(s)` - The value of `s` is printed.
   - `n -= 1` - `n` is decremented by 1.
4. The loop continues until `n` becomes 0.

### Impact on Variables:
- `n` is initially assigned a value from `input` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- `l` is assigned a value from `input` in each iteration of the loop.
- `s` is calculated and printed in each iteration of the loop.
- `t` and the coordinates `x_i`, `y_i` are not affected by the code.

### Calculation:
- `s` is calculated as `s = (l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`.
- The expression `(l - (4 * (l // 4)))` gives the remainder when `l` is divided by 4.
- The expression `(l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` gives half of this remainder.

### Output State:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
- For each of the `t` testcases, there are four lines, each containing two integers `x_i`, `y_i` such that -1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000, representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
- `n` is 0.
- `l` is the last input integer.
- `s` is the last calculated value and printed.
