Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for checking and transforming the array is flawed. The program attempts to split an element and check if the resulting digits are sorted, but it does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting the element and inserting the digits back into the array. 

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  12 28 5
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

The program incorrectly outputs "YES" for this input. The correct output should be "NO" because there is no way to split the elements to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order. The program fails to properly simulate the splitting operation and check the resulting array for sorted order.
