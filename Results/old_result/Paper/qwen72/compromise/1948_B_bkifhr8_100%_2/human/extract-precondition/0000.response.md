Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input (stdin) and output through standard output (stdout). The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the length of the array, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99) representing the elements of the array.**
