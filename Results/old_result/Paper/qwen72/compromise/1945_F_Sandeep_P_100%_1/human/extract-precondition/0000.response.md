It seems there was a misunderstanding. The provided code snippet is a decorator template and does not relate to the problem described. Let's focus on the actual problem and provide a relevant function with its precondition.

### Problem Description
Kirill wants to gather mushrooms under the Wise Oak to make a magical elixir. The strength of the elixir is determined by the product of the number of mushrooms and the minimum magic power among them. However, the magic power of certain mushrooms decreases to 0 based on a permutation `p`. The goal is to maximize the elixir's strength while minimizing the number of mushrooms used.

### Function
Here is a function that could be part of the solution:

```python
def calculate_max_strength(v, p):
    # Implementation of the function to calculate the maximum strength of the elixir
    pass
```

### Precondition
**v is a list of integers where 1 <= len(v) <= 200,000 and 1 <= v[i] <= 10^9. p is a permutation of integers from 1 to len(v).**
