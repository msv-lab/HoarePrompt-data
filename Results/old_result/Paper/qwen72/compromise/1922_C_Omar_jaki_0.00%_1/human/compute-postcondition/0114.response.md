To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 3.
2. `c` and `d` are assigned new values returned by `r()`.
3. If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`; otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `u`:**
   - `u` is a non-zero value decreased by 3. This means `u` could be any value except zero, and it is reduced by 3. For example, if `u` was initially 5, then `u` would be 2 after the decrease.

2. **Understanding `c` and `d`:**
   - `c` and `d` are assigned new values returned by `r()`. The function `r()` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` are compared, and the result of this comparison is used to determine their relationship.

3. **Comparison of `c` and `d`:**
   - If `c` is less than `d`, then `c` is less than `d`.
   - Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

4. **Accessing Elements in `b`:**
   - The code snippet accesses elements in the list `b` using the indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are determined by the comparison, the indices will depend on the values of `c` and `d`.

5. **Subtraction of Elements:**
   - The code subtracts the element at index `(c - 1) * 2` from the element at index `(d - 1) * 2`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can describe the output as follows:

- The exact values of `c` and `d` are not provided, but we know they are determined by the function `r()`.
- The indices `(d - 1) * 2` and `(c - 1) * 2` are used to access elements in the list `b`.
- The difference between these two elements is printed.

Since the exact values of `c`, `d`, and the list `b` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2] (where `b` is the list, `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, and the indices are calculated based on these values)**
