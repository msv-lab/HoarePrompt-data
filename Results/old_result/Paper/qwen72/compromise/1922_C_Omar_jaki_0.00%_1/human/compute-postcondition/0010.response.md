To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop and the current state:

### Given Loop:
```python
for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Current State:
- `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` is a list starting with `-1000000000.0`, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements
- `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
- `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i
- `b` is `[0, 0, v`

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The loop head involves the variables `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which are derived from the list `a` using the `zip` function.
2. **Zip Function**: The `zip` function creates tuples from the corresponding elements of the lists `a`, `a[1:]`, `a[2:]`, and `a[3:]`.
3. **Iteration Condition**: For the loop to execute one more time, there must be enough elements in `a` to form the next tuple `(w, x, y, z)`.

### Current State of `a`:
- `a` has at least 4 elements: `[-1000000000.0, r(), r(), 2000000000.0]`.

### Adjusting the State:
- After the previous iteration, the first element of `a` (which is `-1000000000.0`) is no longer part of the next tuple.
- The next tuple will be formed from the elements starting from the second element of `a`.

### New State:
- The list `a` must still have at least 4 elements for the loop to continue.
- The new tuple will be `(a[1], a[2], a[3], a[4])`.

### Final State:
- `t` remains unchanged: `t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` remains unchanged: `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
- `a` must have at least 4 elements, but the first element is now the second element from the previous state.
- `m` remains unchanged: `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5
- `queries` remains unchanged: `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i
- `b` remains unchanged: `b` is `[0, 0, v`

### Conclusion:
State: **`t` is the first integer read from the input minus 1, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list starting with the second element of the previous state, followed by an unknown sequence of elements produced by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`, and must have at least 4 elements, `m` is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `queries` is a list of m pairs (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, `b` is `[0, 0, v`**
