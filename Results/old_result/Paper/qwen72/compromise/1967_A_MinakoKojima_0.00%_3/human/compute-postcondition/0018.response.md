Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, `k` is now 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `n` is the number of elements in the list `a`, and it does not change.
- The variable `k` is reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop.
- The list `a` is modified such that each element in the list is equal to `m`, which is the smallest integer in the original list `a`.
- The variable `m` remains the smallest integer in the list `a`.
- The variable `ans` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
