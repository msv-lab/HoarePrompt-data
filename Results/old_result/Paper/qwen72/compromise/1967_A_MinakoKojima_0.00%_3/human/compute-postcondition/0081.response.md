Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, and `i` is set to `n - 1`. If `n` is 1, `ans` is set to the first element of the list `a` and `i` is set to 0.***
