Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `i` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` from its current value.
- The value of `a[i]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `m`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged.
