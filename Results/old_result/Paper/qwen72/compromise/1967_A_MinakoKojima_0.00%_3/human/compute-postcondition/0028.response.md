Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.
- `ans` is initially 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
if k >= n * m:
    ans = math.factorial(n)
else:
    n > 0
    k = 0
    a = [m] * n
    ans = m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Check the condition `k >= n * m`:**
   - If this condition is true, `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`.
   - If this condition is false, the code proceeds to the else block.

2. **Else Block:**
   - `n > 0` is a condition that must be true for the code to execute further.
   - `k` is set to 0.
   - `a` is redefined as a list of `n` elements, each equal to `m`.
   - `ans` is calculated as `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`.

### Calculation of `ans` in the Else Block:
- Since `a` is a list of `n` elements, all of which are equal to `m`, the differences `(a[1] - a[0])`, `(a[2] - a[1])`, ..., `(a[n-1] - a[n-2])` will all be 0.
- Therefore, the product `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])` will be `m * 0 * 0 * ... * 0`, which is 0.
- Hence, `ans` will be 0 in the else block.

### Final Output:
- If `k >= n * m`, `ans` will be `math.factorial(n)`.
- Otherwise, `ans` will be 0.

### Conclusion:
The `print(ans)` statement will print either `math.factorial(n)` if `k >= n * m`, or 0 if `k < n * m`.

Output: **ans (where ans is `math.factorial(n)` if `k >= n * m`, or 0 if `k < n * m`)**
