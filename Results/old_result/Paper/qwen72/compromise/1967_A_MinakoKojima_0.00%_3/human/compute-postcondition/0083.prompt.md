Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins available to buy new cards, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of each type i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    m = min(a)
    ans = 0
    if k >= n * m:
        ans = math.factorial(n)
    else:
        k -= n * m
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
        ans = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0 initially. If `k` is greater than or equal to the product of `n` and `m`, `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is set to 0, `a` is a list of integers where each element is `m`, and `ans` is set to `m * (a[1] - a[0]) * (a[2] - a[1]) * ... * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, with `i` being `n-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is equal to the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `ans` is equal to the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[n-1] - a[n-2])`, and `i` is set to `n - 1`. If `n` is 1, `ans` is set to the first element of the list `a` and `i` is set to 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
