The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`, and the list `a`. Therefore, we can only adjust these objects. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`.
- `ans` is 0.
- `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i-1])`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i-1])`, `i` is 1**.
