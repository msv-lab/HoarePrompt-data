To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100
- `_` is 0
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user
- `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`
- `ans` is 0
- `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`
- `i` is 1

### Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over the range `0` to `n-1`.
- At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

### Adjustments:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2.
- `n` must remain greater than `i` for the loop to execute again. Since `i` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is now `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `a[i]` is now `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])`, `i` is 2**
