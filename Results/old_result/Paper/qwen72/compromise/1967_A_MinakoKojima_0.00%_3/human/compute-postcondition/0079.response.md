Output State: **`t` remains the same (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `_` remains the same (2), `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is now 3, `k`, `a`, `m` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration, `ans` is now `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `k`, `a`, `m`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
- The specific value of `ans` is now the result of the previous `ans` multiplied by the difference between the third and second elements of the list `a`.
