You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are the last provided input integers, `a` is the last provided input list of integers, `m` is the smallest integer in the last provided list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` from 0 to `n-1`, and `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the maximum score. Specifically, the logic for updating the array `a` and calculating the final answer `ans` is flawed.

1. **Initial Check and Update**:
   - The program checks if `k >= n * m`, where `m` is the minimum value in the array `a`. If this condition is true, it sets `ans` to `math.factorial(n)`, which is incorrect. The factorial of `n` represents the number of permutations of `n` distinct elements, but it does not represent the number of subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Updating the Array `a`**:
   - The program updates the array `a` by adding `min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` to each element. This logic is intended to distribute the coins to increase the number of cards of each type, but it does not correctly handle the distribution to maximize the score.

3. **Final Calculation of `ans`**:
   - The program calculates `ans` by multiplying the differences between consecutive elements in the updated array `a`. This is not the correct way to calculate the number of subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 4
6 1 8
```
- Here, `n = 3`, `k = 4`, and the array `a` is `[6, 1, 8]`.
- The minimum value `m` is `1`.
- The program will set `k -= n * m`, so `k` becomes `1`.
- It will then update the array `a` to `[6, 2, 8]` (since `1 + min(1, 1 + 1 // 3 - 1) = 2`).
- Finally, it will calculate `ans` as `6 * (2 - 6) * (8 - 2) = 6 * (-4) * 6 = -144`, which is clearly incorrect.

The correct approach should involve:
- Determining the minimum number of cards needed to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
- Distributing the coins to balance the number of cards of each type as much as possible.
- Calculating the maximum number of subarrays of length `n` that can be formed as permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
