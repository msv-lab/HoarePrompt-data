Reasoning:
The program aims to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, counting the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same, and then determining if removing this minimum number of elements can make the array stop being beautiful. However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Consecutive Elements**: The program incorrectly increments `i` and updates `num` and `same` in a way that does not properly handle the conditions for a beautiful array. Specifically, the program should check for sequences where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced, but it does not do this correctly.

2. **Handling of Beautiful Arrays**: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already beautiful and consists of identical elements. In such a case, it should output `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**: The program's approach to finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It should find the minimum length of a sequence where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced, and then determine if removing elements from this sequence can make the array non-beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum length of a sequence where a[i-1] == a[i+1]
        minn = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                minn = min(minn, 1)  # At least one element can be removed
        
        # If no such sequence exists, the array is not beautiful
        if minn == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version first checks if all elements in the array are the same, in which case it outputs `-1`. If not, it iterates through the array to find the minimum length of a sequence where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced, and then outputs the minimum number of elements to remove, which is always `1` if such a sequence exists. If no such sequence exists, it outputs `-1`.
