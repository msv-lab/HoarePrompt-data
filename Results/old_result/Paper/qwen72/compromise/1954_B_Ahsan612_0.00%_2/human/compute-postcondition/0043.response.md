Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is 1, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, and the input for the loop must be greater than 1. If `minn` is `inf`, `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1.
- The initial state already specifies that `same` is 1, so this assignment does not change the value.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `ar`, `i`, and `minn` remain unchanged.
- The condition for the loop input being greater than 1 is still valid.
- Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
