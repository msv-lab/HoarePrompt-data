Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, which means `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
   - `num` is the last unique number in the list `ar`.
   - `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is not equal to infinity.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(minn)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is the length of the list `ar`.
   - `num` is the last unique number in the list `ar`. This means that if the list ends with a sequence of the same number, `num` is that number.
   - `same` is the count of how many times `num` appears consecutively at the end of the list.
   - `minn` is initially some value (not infinity), and it is updated to be the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.

4. **Determine the Value of `minn`:**
   - The value of `minn` will be the smaller of the original `minn` and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last unique number in the list `ar`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(minn)` statement will output the value of `minn`, which is the minimum value between the original `minn` and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last unique number in the list `ar`.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between the original minn and the count of consecutive occurrences of the last unique number in the list ar)**
