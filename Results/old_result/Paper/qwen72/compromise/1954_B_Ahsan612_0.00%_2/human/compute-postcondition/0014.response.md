Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`, `minn` is 1.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` because it is already set to 1 in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
