Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the element at index `i` of `ar`, `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`, `same` is 1, `i` is 4.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` because it was already 1 in the initial state. Therefore, all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
