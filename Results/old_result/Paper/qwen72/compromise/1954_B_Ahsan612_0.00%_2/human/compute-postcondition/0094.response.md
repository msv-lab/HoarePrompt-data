Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input and `len(ar)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `num` is `ar[2]`, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `ar[1]` is not equal to `num`.**

The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its previous value (`inf`) and the value of `same` (1). Since `inf` is greater than 1, `minn` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
