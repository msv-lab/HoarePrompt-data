Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) and the length of each sublist n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) is provided in the first element of the sublist. Additionally, in every test case, the given array a is beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
    same = 1
    num = ar[0]
    minn = inf
    i = 1
    while i < len(ar):
        if ar[i] == num:
            same += 1
        else:
            i += 1
            num = ar[i]
            minn = min(minn, same)
            same = 1
        i += 1
    minn = min(minn, same)
    if minn == inf:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(minn)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `same` is 1, and `i` is equal to the length of `ar`. If `minn` is `inf`, `minn` remains `inf`. Otherwise, `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last element of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is now 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1, and is not equal to infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique number in the list `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list, and `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is updated to the value of `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
