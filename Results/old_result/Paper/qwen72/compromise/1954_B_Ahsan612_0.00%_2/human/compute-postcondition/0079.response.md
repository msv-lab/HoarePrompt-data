Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input.
   - `i` is equal to `len(ar)`.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1, and `minn` is not equal to infinity.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(minn)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `minn` is described as the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.
   - Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must be a finite value.
   - The minimum value between any finite number and 1 will be 1 if the finite number is greater than or equal to 1, or the finite number itself if it is less than 1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that `minn` is not equal to infinity, the value of `minn` after the operation `min(minn, 1)` will be either 1 or a value less than 1.
   - Since the exact value of `minn` is not provided, we can only say that the printed value will be the minimum of the original `minn` and 1.

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between the original minn and 1)**
