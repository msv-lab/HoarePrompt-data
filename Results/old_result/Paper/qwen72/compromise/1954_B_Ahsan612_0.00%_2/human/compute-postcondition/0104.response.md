Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `ar` is a list of integers provided by the user input, and `len(ar)` is greater than 3. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num` and `ar[i]` is also equal to `num`, then `same` is 3, `minn` remains `inf`, and `i` is 3. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num` but `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 3, `num` is updated to `ar[2]`, `same` remains 1, and `minn` is set to 1. If `ar[1]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `num` is updated to `ar[3]`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is set to 1.***
