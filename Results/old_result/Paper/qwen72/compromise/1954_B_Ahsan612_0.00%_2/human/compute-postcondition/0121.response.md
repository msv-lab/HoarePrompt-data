Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, `ar` is the last list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique number in the list `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list, and `minn` is the minimum value of the counts of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is updated to the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the specified range.
- The variable `n` holds the value of the last input integer, which is the length of the last list `ar`.
- The variable `ar` holds the last list of integers provided by the user.
- The variable `i` is equal to the length of the last list `ar`, indicating that the loop has completed processing the entire list.
- The variable `num` holds the last unique number in the list `ar`.
- The variable `same` holds the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list `ar`.
- The variable `minn` holds the minimum value of the counts of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, it is updated to the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list. If `minn` was already a finite value, it remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list. If no consecutive occurrences are found, `minn` will be `inf` and the loop will print `-1`. Otherwise, it will print the value of `minn`.
