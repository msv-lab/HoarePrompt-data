You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) and the length of each sublist n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) is provided in the first element of the sublist. Additionally, in every test case, the given array a is beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1
        
        num = ar[0]
        
        minn = inf
        
        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the last input integer greater than 0, `ar` is the last list of integers provided by the user input, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `num` is the last unique number in the list `ar`, `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of `num` at the end of the list, and `minn` is the minimum value of the counts of consecutive occurrences of any number in the list `ar`. If `minn` was initially `inf`, then `minn` is updated to the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum value between the original `minn` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences found in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `cases`. It processes each of the `t` test cases, where each test case is a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` with the first element being `n`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
