Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `ar` is a list of integers provided by user input.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - `minn` is not equal to infinity.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(minn)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `minn` is described as the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1.
   - Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, it must be a finite value.
   - The operation `min(minn, 1)` will always result in the smaller of the two values.
   - If `minn` is originally greater than 1, then `minn` will be set to 1.
   - If `minn` is originally 1 or less, then `minn` will remain the same.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Regardless of the original value of `minn`, the final value of `minn` will be the minimum of the original `minn` and 1.
   - Since `minn` is not equal to infinity, the final value of `minn` will be either 1 or a value less than 1.

Therefore, the output of the `print(minn)` statement will be:

Output: **minn (where minn is the minimum value between the original minn and 1)**
