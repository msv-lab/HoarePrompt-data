Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly. One specific case where the program fails is when there are more extroverts than can be accommodated in the available tents, even with the help of universals. For example, consider the input:

```
1
1 4 1
```

Here, there is 1 introvert, 4 extroverts, and 1 universal. According to the problem description, each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two others. However, the program incorrectly outputs `-1` for this case, while it should be possible to accommodate all participants with 3 tents:

- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for 3 extroverts (one extrovert and two universals, but since there is only one universal, this is not possible).
- 1 tent for the remaining extrovert and the universal.

The correct output should be `3`:

- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for 2 extroverts and the universal.
- 1 tent for the remaining 2 extroverts.

The program fails to correctly handle this case and others like it, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
