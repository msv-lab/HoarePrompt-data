The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `a`. It then modifies the list `a` by removing leading and trailing zeros. After the modifications, it counts the number of zeros remaining in the list `a` and prints this count. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After all test cases are processed, the variable `t` will be 0, and the variables `n`, `a`, and `res` will hold their final values from the last test case.
