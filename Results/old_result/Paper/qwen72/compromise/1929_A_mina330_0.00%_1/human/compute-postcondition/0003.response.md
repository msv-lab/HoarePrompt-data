The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists `arrays`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. The list of lists `arrays` contains `t` inner lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each integer `a_i` in the inner lists has the constraint 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The result for each test case is based on the elements of the corresponding inner list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `arrays` where each inner list contains integers. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the elements of the corresponding inner list.**
