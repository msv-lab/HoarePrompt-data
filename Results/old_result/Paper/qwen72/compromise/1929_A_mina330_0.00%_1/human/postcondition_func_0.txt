The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, for the list of integers. The function prints this sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
