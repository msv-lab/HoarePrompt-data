Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted, which is a crucial step. Sorting helps in maximizing the differences between the largest and smallest elements.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The program calculates the beauty of the array by summing the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs. This is done by iterating from the start and end of the sorted array towards the center.
4. **Output**: The result for each test case is printed correctly.

The logic of the program ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved by always taking the largest possible difference between pairs of elements. This is because the sorted array will have the largest elements at the end and the smallest elements at the beginning, and the differences between these pairs will be maximized.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the program:

- **Reading Test Cases**: `ntest = int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - `n = int(input())` reads the length of the array.
  - `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads the array elements and converts them to a list of integers.
  - `a.sort()` sorts the array in non-decreasing order.
  - `kq = 0` initializes the variable to store the beauty of the array.
  - The loop `for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1)` iterates through the first half of the array.
  - Inside the loop, `kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the i-th smallest and the i-th largest element and adds it to `kq`.
- **Printing the Result**: `print(kq)` prints the maximum beauty for each test case.

This approach ensures that the maximum possible beauty is calculated for each test case, and the program handles all the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.
