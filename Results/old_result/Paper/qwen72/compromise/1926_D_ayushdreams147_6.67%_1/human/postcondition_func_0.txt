The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`. The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the presence of these XORed values, but the final state of `count` is not relevant to the user.
