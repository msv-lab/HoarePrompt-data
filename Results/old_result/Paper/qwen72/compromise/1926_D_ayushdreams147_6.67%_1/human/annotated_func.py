#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1

    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`, `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\) and the value is the count of how many times the original integer appeared in `a` minus the count of how many times the XORed integer appeared in `a`.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the count of unique integers in `a` that, when XORed with \(2^{31} - 1\), do not already exist in `a`. The function modifies a dictionary `count` to track the presence of these XORed values, but the final state of `count` is not relevant to the user.
