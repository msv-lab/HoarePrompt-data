Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the condition where the numbers in the same group must not have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed:

1. The program uses `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to invert the bits of `num` from the 1st to the 31st bit. However, this operation inverts all 32 bits of the number, including the 32nd bit, which is not part of the 1st to 31st bits as specified in the problem description.

2. The program incorrectly updates the `count` dictionary and increments `res` in a way that does not ensure the correct grouping of numbers. Specifically, it checks if `num` is not in `count` and then uses the inverted value of `num` to update the count, which does not align with the problem's requirement that no two numbers in the same group should have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.

3. The program does not correctly handle cases where the same number appears multiple times. For example, if the input contains multiple `0` values, the program will incorrectly place them in different groups, which violates the problem's requirement.

Example of incorrect behavior:
For the input:
```
1
4
0 0 2147483647 2147483647
```
The expected output is `2` because the numbers can be grouped as follows:
- Group 1: `0, 2147483647`
- Group 2: `0, 2147483647`

However, the program will output `4` because it incorrectly places each `0` in a separate group.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should use a more sophisticated approach to ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit. One possible approach is to use a bitmask to track the groups and ensure that no two numbers in the same group have the same bit pattern in the 1st to 31st bits.
