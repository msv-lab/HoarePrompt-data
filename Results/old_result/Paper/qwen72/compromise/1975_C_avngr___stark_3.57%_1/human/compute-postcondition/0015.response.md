Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is 3. If the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains the maximum of the minimum values between `a[2]` and `a[1]` or 0 if no update occurred.***
