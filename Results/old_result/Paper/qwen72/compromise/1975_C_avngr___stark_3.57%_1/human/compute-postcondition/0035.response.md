The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t-1` (and must be greater than 0), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from user input, `i` is `n-1`, and `max` is the maximum value among all the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a`.**
