Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then finds the maximum value among the minimum values of consecutive pairs in the list `a`. Finally, it prints this maximum value for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution. **
