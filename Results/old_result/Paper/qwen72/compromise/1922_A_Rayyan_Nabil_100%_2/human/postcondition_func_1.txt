The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then iterates `t` times, each time reading an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `1 <= n <= 20` and each string is of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each iteration, it calls `func_1` with the parameters `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, and appends the result to a list `results`. After all iterations, it prints each element in `results` to the console. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `results` contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1` for the corresponding iteration, and all elements of `results` have been printed to the console. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their final values from the last iteration.
