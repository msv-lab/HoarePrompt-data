Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine if the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, in no cases, or maybe in some cases. Here is the issue:

- The program counts how many times the favorite cube's value appears in the first `k` elements of the sorted list (`removed_count`).
- It also counts the total number of times the favorite cube's value appears in the entire sorted list (`favorite_count`).
- However, the logic to determine the output is flawed. Specifically, the program should check if the favorite cube's value is among the first `k` elements of the sorted list, but it doesn't account for the position of the favorite cube itself in the sorted list.

### Corrected Program:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the favorite cube's value is within the first `k` elements of the sorted list and also consider the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)
        
        # Find the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list
        favorite_position = sorted_a.index(favorite_value)
        
        # Determine if the favorite cube will be removed
        if favorite_position < k:
            print('YES')
        elif favorite_position >= k:
            # Check if there are other cubes with the same value in the first k elements
            if favorite_value in sorted_a[:k]:
                print('MAYBE')
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Finding the Position of the Favorite Cube:**
   - We use `sorted_a.index(favorite_value)` to find the first occurrence of the favorite cube's value in the sorted list.
   - This gives us the position of the favorite cube in the sorted list.

2. **Determining the Output:**
   - If the favorite cube's position is less than `k`, it will always be removed, so we print "YES".
   - If the favorite cube's position is greater than or equal to `k`, we need to check if there are other cubes with the same value in the first `k` elements.
   - If there are other cubes with the same value in the first `k` elements, the favorite cube might be removed, so we print "MAYBE".
   - If there are no other cubes with the same value in the first `k` elements, the favorite cube will not be removed, so we print "NO".

This corrected program should handle all the test cases correctly.
