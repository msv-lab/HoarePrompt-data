You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Dmitry has n cubes, numbered from left to right from 1 to n . The cube with
index f is his favorite.

Dmitry threw all the cubes on the table, and the i -th cube showed the value
a_i (1 \le a_i \le 100 ). After that, he arranged the cubes in non-increasing
order of their values, from largest to smallest. If two cubes show the same
value, they can go in any order.

After sorting, Dmitry removed the first k cubes. Then he became interested in
whether he removed his favorite cube (note that its position could have
changed after sorting).

For example, if n=5 , f=2 , a = [4, \color{green}3, 3, 2, 3] (the favorite
cube is highlighted in green), and k = 2 , the following could have happened:

  * After sorting a=[4, \color{green}3, 3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the second position, it will be removed. 
  * After sorting a=[4, 3, \color{green}3, 3, 2] , since the favorite cube ended up in the third position, it will not be removed. 

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case description contains three integers n , f ,
and k (1 \le f, k \le n \le 100 ) — the number of cubes, the index of Dmitry's
favorite cube, and the number of removed cubes, respectively.

The second line of each test case description contains n integers a_i (1 \le
a_i \le 100 ) — the values shown on the cubes.

Output

For each test case, output one line — "YES" if the cube will be removed in all
cases, "NO" if it will not be removed in any case, "MAYBE" if it may be either
removed or left.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "YES", "nO",
"mAyBe" will be accepted as answers.

    #State: After the loop executes all `t` iterations, `n`, `f`, and `k` will have been reassigned `t` times, and `a` will have been reassigned `t` times as well. For each iteration, `favorite_value` will be the value of `a[f - 1]`, `sorted_a` will be the sorted version of `a` in descending order, `removed_count` will be the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in the first `k` elements of `sorted_a`, and `favorite_count` will be the total number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count` for any iteration, "YES" will be printed. If `removed_count` is 0 for any iteration, "NO" will be printed. Otherwise, "MAYBE" will be printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` representing the number of cubes, the index of the favorite cube, and the number of cubes to be removed, respectively.
   - It then reads the list of values `a` for the cubes.

2. **Favorite Cube Value:**
   - The program correctly identifies the value of the favorite cube using `favorite_value = a[f - 1]`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - The program sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order using `sorted_a = sorted(a, reverse=True)`. This step is correct as it ensures the cubes are arranged from largest to smallest.

4. **Counting Removed Cubes:**
   - The program initializes `removed_count` to 0 and iterates over the first `k` elements of the sorted list `sorted_a`.
   - For each element in the first `k` positions, it checks if the value is equal to `favorite_value` and increments `removed_count` if it is.

5. **Counting Total Favorite Cubes:**
   - The program counts the total number of cubes with the value `favorite_value` using `favorite_count = sorted_a.count(favorite_value)`.

6. **Output Determination:**
   - If `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`, it means all cubes with the favorite value were removed, so the program outputs "YES".
   - If `removed_count` is 0, it means none of the cubes with the favorite value were removed, so the program outputs "NO".
   - Otherwise, if some but not all cubes with the favorite value were removed, the program outputs "MAYBE".

### Analysis of Edge Cases:
- **All Favorite Cubes Removed:**
  - If all cubes with the favorite value are among the first `k` elements of the sorted list, the program correctly outputs "YES".
- **No Favorite Cubes Removed:**
  - If none of the cubes with the favorite value are among the first `k` elements of the sorted list, the program correctly outputs "NO".
- **Some Favorite Cubes Removed:**
  - If some but not all cubes with the favorite value are among the first `k` elements of the sorted list, the program correctly outputs "MAYBE".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem as described and produces the correct output for all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
