Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `i` is `k - 1`.
   - `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`.
   - `removed_count` remains unchanged.
   - The current value of `removed_count` is equal to `favorite_count`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `k`, `i`, `favorite_count`, and `removed_count` do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of the variables mentioned in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
