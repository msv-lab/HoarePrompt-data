Postcondition: **`k` is the input integer, `i` is `k - 1`. If any of the first `k` elements in `sorted_a` are equal to `favorite_value`, `removed_count` is increased by the number of such occurrences. Otherwise, `removed_count` remains unchanged. `favorite_count` is the number of occurrences of `favorite_value` in `sorted_a`. `removed_count` is not equal to `favorite_count`. The current value of `removed_count` is 0.**
