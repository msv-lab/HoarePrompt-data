### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with a price of 1. This is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from this single stall.
   - If `n < k`, the program prints "NO" and returns immediately. This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a list `costs` with two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - The idea is to create a stall with a high price (`n - k + 1`) to ensure Alice buys only a few jewels from it, and a stall with a low price (`1`) to ensure Alice can buy the remaining jewels.
   - However, this approach is not always correct. For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 4`, the program sets `costs` to `[3, 1]`. Alice will buy 2 jewels from the first stall (costing 3 coins each) and 0 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), which totals 2 jewels, not 4. This is incorrect.

4. **Greedy Buying Simulation:**
   - The program iterates over the `costs` list and calculates how many jewels Alice can buy from each stall.
   - It updates `n` by subtracting the total cost of the jewels bought from the current stall.
   - It accumulates the total number of jewels bought in `h`.
   - The program checks if `h` is less than `k` and prints "NO" if it is. Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (which is 2 in this case), and the prices of the stalls.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2) before printing the prices of the stalls. This is incorrect because the output format should be:
     - "YES"
     - Number of stalls
     - Prices of the stalls
   - The correct order should be:
     - "YES"
     - Number of stalls
     - Prices of the stalls

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Output for "YES" Case:**
  - The program prints "YES" and the number of stalls (2) before printing the prices of the stalls. This is incorrect.
  - The correct order should be:
    - "YES"
    - Number of stalls
    - Prices of the stalls

- **Incorrect Logic for Cost Calculation:**
  - The fixed approach of setting `costs` to `[n - k + 1, 1]` does not work for all cases.
  - For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 4`, the program sets `costs` to `[3, 1]`. Alice will buy 2 jewels from the first stall (costing 3 coins each) and 0 jewels from the second stall (costing 1 coin each), which totals 2 jewels, not 4. This is incorrect.

### Corrected Program:
To ensure the program works correctly for all cases, we need to adjust the logic to dynamically set the prices of the stalls to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

```python
import math as m

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        print(' '.join(str(n // k + (1 if i < n % k else 0)) for i in range(k)))
```

### Explanation of Corrected Program:
- **Initial Check:**
  - If `n < k`, print "NO" and return.
- **Dynamic Stall Prices:**
  - If `n >= k`, print "YES".
  - Set up `k` stalls.
  - For each stall, the price is calculated as `n // k + (1 if i < n % k else 0)`. This ensures that the total number of jewels Alice can buy is exactly `k`.
  - `n // k` is the base price for each stall.
  - `n % k` is the remainder, which is distributed among the first `n % k` stalls to ensure the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.

### Correctness:
The original program has issues with the output format and the logic for setting stall prices. The corrected program ensures that the output format is correct and the logic for setting stall prices is dynamic and works for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
