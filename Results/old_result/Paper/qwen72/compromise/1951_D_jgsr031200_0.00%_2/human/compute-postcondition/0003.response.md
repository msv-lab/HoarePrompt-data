The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer value `1`. The initial state describes that `n` and `k` are positive integers with values between 1 and \(10^{18}\), and that the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` in any way.

Output: **1**
