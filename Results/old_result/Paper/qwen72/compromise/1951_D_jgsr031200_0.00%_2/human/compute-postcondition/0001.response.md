The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'YES'`. The precondition states that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, and the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `k` in any way. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
