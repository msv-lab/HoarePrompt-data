#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer corresponds to the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n, consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. Additionally, n is even, no arrows point outside the grid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `i` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a new input string, `b` is a new input string, and `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `b[-2]` is not '>', `no_path` remains either True or False based on the initial conditions. If `b[-2]` is '>', and `n` is 1, `no_path` remains either True or False based on the initial conditions. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` was initially True, it remains True. If `b[-2]` is '>', `n` is greater than 1, and `no_path` was initially False, `k` is updated to the last odd number less than `n`, and if any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. The function checks if the second-to-last character in `b` is '>'. If it is not, the function prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the first row to the second row by examining the characters at even and odd indices in `a` and `b`. If all characters at even indices in `b` are '>' and all characters at odd indices in `a` are '>', the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case.
