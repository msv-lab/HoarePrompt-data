Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, reads the integer `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the grid.

2. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the second-to-last character in `b` is '>'. If it is not, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because it would be impossible to move to the last column from the second-to-last column. This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Edge Case for n == 1**: The function checks if `n` is 1. However, the problem statement specifies that `n` is always even and `2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`, so `n` can never be 1. This check is unnecessary and can be removed.

4. **Path Check**:
   - The function then checks if there is a path from the first row to the second row by examining the characters at even and odd indices in `a` and `b`.
   - The first loop checks if all characters at even indices in `b` are '>'. If any character at an even index is not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - The second loop checks if all characters at odd indices in `a` are '>'. If any character at an odd index is not '>', it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Final Decision**:
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both loops, it means the robot can move to the last column in the second row, and the function prints 'YES'.
   - If `no_path` is `False` after both loops, it means the robot cannot move to the last column in the second row, and the function prints 'NO'.

However, there is a logical error in the path check:
- The function should not set `no_path` back to `True` after the first loop. This reset makes the second loop ineffective because `no_path` will always be `True` when entering the second loop.
- The second loop should only be executed if the first loop did not find any '<' at even indices in `b`.

Given these points, the function is incorrect because it resets `no_path` to `True` after the first loop, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        else:
            no_path = False
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = True
                    break
            if not no_path:
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = True
                        break
            if no_path:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
```

This corrected version ensures that `no_path` is not reset after the first loop and correctly checks both conditions.
