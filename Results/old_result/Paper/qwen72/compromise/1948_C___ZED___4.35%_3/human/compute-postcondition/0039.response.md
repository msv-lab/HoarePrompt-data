Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character '>', `k` is the last even number less than `n`. `no_path` is True, and it indicates that either all characters at even indices in `b` are '>', or all characters at odd indices from 1 to `n-2` in `a` are '>'.**
