Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
   - `a` is an input string.
   - `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character '>'.
   - `k` is the last even number less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is True.

2. **Determine the value of `k`:**
   - `k` is defined as the last even number less than `n`.
   - To find `k`, we need to identify the largest even number that is less than `n`.

3. **Finding the last even number less than `n`:**
   - If `n` is even, the last even number less than `n` is `n - 2`.
   - If `n` is odd, the last even number less than `n` is `n - 1`.

4. **Print statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(k)`.
   - Therefore, the output will be the value of `k`.

Since `n` is an input integer greater than 2, we can express `k` as follows:
- If `n` is even, `k = n - 2`.
- If `n` is odd, `k = n - 1`.

Thus, the output will be the last even number less than `n`.

Output: **k (where k is the last even number less than n)**
