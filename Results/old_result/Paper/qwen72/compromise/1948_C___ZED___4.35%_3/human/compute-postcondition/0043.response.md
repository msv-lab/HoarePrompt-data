Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is an input string, `b` is an input string with the second-to-last character '>', `k` is the last even number less than `n`. If `no_path` is True, it indicates that either all characters at even indices in `b` are '>', or all characters at odd indices from 1 to `n-2` in `a` are '>'. If `no_path` is False, it indicates that there is at least one character at an even index in `b` that is not '>', and there is at least one character at an odd index from 1 to `n-2` in `a` that is not '>'.***
