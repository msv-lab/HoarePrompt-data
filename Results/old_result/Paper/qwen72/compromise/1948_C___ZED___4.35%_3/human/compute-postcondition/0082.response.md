Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is the last even number less than `n`.
   - `no_path` is True.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If any character at an even index in `b` is not '>', `no_path` is set to False.
   - If `no_path` is False, then `k` is the last odd number less than `n`.
   - If any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>', `no_path` remains False.
   - Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The initial value of `no_path` is True.
   - The first condition checks if any character at an even index in `b` is not '>'. If this condition is met, `no_path` is set to False.
   - If `no_path` is False, the second condition sets `k` to the last odd number less than `n`.
   - The third condition checks if any character at an odd index in `a` (from 1 to `k`) is not '>'. If this condition is met, `no_path` remains False.
   - If none of the above conditions change `no_path` to False, `no_path` remains True.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains `print('YES')`.

Given that the initial value of `no_path` is True and the conditions provided do not change `no_path` to False, the `print` statement will execute as is.

Output: **YES**
