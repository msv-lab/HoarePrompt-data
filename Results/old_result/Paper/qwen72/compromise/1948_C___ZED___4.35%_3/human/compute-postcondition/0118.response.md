Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 6.
   - `a` is a new input string.
   - `b` is a new input string.
   - `k` is 5.
   - If the character at index 3 of `a` is not '>', `no_path` is False. Otherwise, `no_path` remains True.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(k)
   ```

3. **Determine the Value of `k`:**
   - According to the initial state, `k` is explicitly set to 5.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will print the value of `k`, which is 5.

Output: **5**
