Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `max_sum`, which is now set to -1.
