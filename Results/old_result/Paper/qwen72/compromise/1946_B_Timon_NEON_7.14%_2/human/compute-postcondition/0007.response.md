Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive integers in `arr`, index of the last positive integer in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a segment of `arr` that was considered as a potential maximum segment, and now includes an additional sublist which is `max_segment` plus `[len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation:
- `new_segment` remains an empty list.
- `max_segment` remains unchanged, still [sum of all positive integers in `arr`, index of the last positive integer in `arr`].
- `segments_variants` now includes an additional sublist, which is `max_segment` plus `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- `max_sum` remains -1.
