The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 <= `a_i` <= 10^9, and `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `i` must be 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -10^9 <= `a_i` <= 10^9 and must have at least one element, `i` is 0, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1**
