To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is `segments_variants` and the variable `segment`.

1. **`segments_variants`**: This is the list that the loop iterates over. For the loop to execute, `segments_variants` must contain at least one element.
2. **`segment`**: This variable will take on the value of each element in `segments_variants` during each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `new_segment` is an empty list.
- `max_segment` is [sum of all positive integers in `arr`, index of the last positive integer in `arr`].
- `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist represents a segment of `arr` that was considered as a potential maximum segment, and now includes an additional sublist which is `max_segment` plus `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- `max_sum` is -1.
- `total_max_segment` is [-1].

To ensure the loop executes, `segments_variants` must have at least one element. The initial state already indicates that `segments_variants` includes an additional sublist, which is `max_segment` plus `[len(arr) - 1]`. Therefore, `segments_variants` must have at least one element.

The state of `segment` is not something we need to adjust explicitly, as it will be set by the loop itself. However, we need to ensure that `segments_variants` is non-empty.

State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all positive integers in `arr`, index of the last positive integer in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists that must have at least one element (which is `max_segment` plus `[len(arr) - 1]`), `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1]**
