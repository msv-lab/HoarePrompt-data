### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Frequency Counters:**
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of elements in `b` and the initial window of `a` (the first `m` elements).
   - This is appropriate for the problem as it allows efficient frequency counting and comparison.

3. **Initial Matches Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the initial number of matches between the elements in the first window of `a` and the elements in `b` using the `min` function to ensure that the count does not exceed the frequency in either array.
   - This is done correctly by summing the minimum of the frequencies of common elements in `window_freq` and `b_freq`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to move through the array `a` and update the count of matches.
   - For each new position of the window:
     - If the number of matches is at least `k`, it increments the count of good subarrays.
     - It adjusts the frequency and matches count by removing the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the element that is sliding into the window.
     - The program correctly updates the `window_freq` counter and the `matches` count.
   - The sliding window logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that the window size remains `m` and the matches are updated efficiently.

5. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks the last window to see if it is good and updates the count of good subarrays if necessary.
   - This final check is necessary because the loop only checks up to `n - m - 1` positions, and the last position is checked outside the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of good subarrays for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem specification.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers.
  - `b` is a list of `m` integers.
  - `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.
  - Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range `1` to `10^6`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - `good_subarrays` is initialized to `0` to count the number of good subarrays.
  - `b_freq` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `b`.
  - `window_freq` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each integer in the first `m` elements of the list `a`.
  - `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for integers that are present in both.

- **Sliding Window Loop:**
  - The loop runs from `0` to `n - m - 1` to slide the window through the array `a`.
  - If `matches` is at least `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented.
  - The element sliding out of the window (`a[i]`) is handled:
    - If `a[i]` is in `b_freq`, `matches` is decremented by the minimum of its frequency in `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
    - The frequency of `a[i]` in `window_freq` is decremented.
    - If the frequency of `a[i]` in `window_freq` becomes `0`, it is removed from `window_freq`.
  - The element sliding into the window (`a[i + m]`) is handled:
    - If `a[i + m]` is in `b_freq`, `matches` is incremented by the minimum of its new frequency in `window_freq` and `b_freq`.
    - The frequency of `a[i + m]` in `window_freq` is incremented.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop, the program checks the last window to see if it is good.
  - If `matches` is at least `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented.
  - The program returns `good_subarrays`, which is the count of good subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of good subarrays. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for counting matches and updating the window is sound.
