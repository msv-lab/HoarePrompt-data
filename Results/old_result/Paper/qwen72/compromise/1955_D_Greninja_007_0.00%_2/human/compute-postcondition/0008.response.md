Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n and 1 <= k <= m, each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6, `b_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the list `b`, `window_freq` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the last m elements of the list `a`, `matches` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` for integers that are present in both `window_freq` and `b_freq`. If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged.***
