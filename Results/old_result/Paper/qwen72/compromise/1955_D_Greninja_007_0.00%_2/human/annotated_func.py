#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, b is a list of m integers where 1 <= m <= n and 1 <= k <= m, and each element in a and b is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6.

If `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `good_subarrays` remains unchanged.

    #The program returns the number of good subarrays, which is the count of subarrays of length `m` in the list `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in `window_freq` and `b_freq` (for integers present in both) is greater than or equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and three integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer (present in both the subarray and `b`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`.
