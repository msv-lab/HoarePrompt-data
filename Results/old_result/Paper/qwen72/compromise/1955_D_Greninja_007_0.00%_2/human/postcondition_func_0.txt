The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, a list `b` of `m` integers, and three integers `k`, `n`, and `m`. It returns the count of subarrays of length `m` in `a` where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer (present in both the subarray and `b`) is greater than or equal to `k`. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`.
