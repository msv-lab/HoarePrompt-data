To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `k` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2. The variable `k` is initialized by the `range` function and will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `k` is `n - 1`.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0**
