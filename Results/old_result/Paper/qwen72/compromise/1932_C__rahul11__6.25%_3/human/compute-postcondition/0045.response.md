Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 2, `c` is `c + 2`, and `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`. If the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is 'L', `ans` is `ans // arr[1] % MOD` and `l` is 3. Otherwise, if the character at the 0th index of the string `s` is not 'L', `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is `r - 3`.***
