Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` is `n - 2`, `c` is 1, `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr`, `res` is a list of `n` zeros with `res[0]` updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided as input, `s` is a list of characters provided as input, `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(n - 1):
    if s[k] == 'L':
        ans = ans // arr[l] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        l += 1
    else:
        ans = ans // arr[r] % MOD
        res[c] = ans % m % MOD
        r -= 1
    c += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 0, `c` is incremented by 1, the first element of `s` determines whether `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1, or `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD` and `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` and `res[c]` are updated based on the first element of `s` and the values of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` and `MOD`, and `l` or `r` is updated accordingly.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` remains unchanged and is greater than 1, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 1, `ans` and `res[c]` are updated based on the first element of `s` and the values of `arr[l]` or `arr[r]` and `MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is incremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, and `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, `r` is decremented by 1, and `res[c]` is updated to `(ans % m) % MOD`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
