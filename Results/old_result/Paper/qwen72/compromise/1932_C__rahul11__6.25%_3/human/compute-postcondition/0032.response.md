Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `k` is 1, `c` is `c + 1`, `ans` is `ans // arr[l] % MOD`, `l` is 2, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so `l` is now 2.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `c`, `ans`, and `res[c]` remain unchanged from their initial state.
