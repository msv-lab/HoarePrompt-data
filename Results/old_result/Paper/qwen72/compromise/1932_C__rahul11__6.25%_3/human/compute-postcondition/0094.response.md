Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `k` is 2, `c` is incremented by 2, `res[c-2]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`, `res[c-1]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`. If `s[k]` is 'L', `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[l] % MOD` and `l` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.**

Explanation: The code `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was already incremented by 1 in the initial state, it is now incremented by 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
