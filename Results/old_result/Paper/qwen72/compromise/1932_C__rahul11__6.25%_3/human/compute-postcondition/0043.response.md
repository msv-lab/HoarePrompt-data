Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `k` is 2, `c` is `c + 2`, `res[c]` is `ans % m % MOD`, `ans` is `ans // arr[r] % MOD`, and `r` is `r - 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res[c]` is updated to `ans % m % MOD`.
- The value of `c` is `c + 2`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans // arr[r] % MOD`.
- The value of `r` is `r - 2`.
- The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- The initial conditions for `c`, `res[c]`, `ans`, and `r` are still valid, but their specific values have been updated as described.
