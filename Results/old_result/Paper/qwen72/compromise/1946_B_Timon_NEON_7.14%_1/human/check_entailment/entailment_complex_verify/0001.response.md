### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum possible sum of an array after performing `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, summing its elements, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The final sum should be taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(number)`:**
     - This function returns the result of `number % 1000000007`, which is used to ensure the final sum is within the required modulo.
     - This function is correct for the purpose of applying the modulo operation.

   - **`func_2(arr)`:**
     - This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices.
     - However, the function has several issues:
       - **Initialization of `max_segment` and `new_segment`:**
         - `max_segment` is initialized as `[0, 0]`, which is not appropriate for tracking the maximum sum and its indices. It should be initialized to a value that represents the smallest possible sum, such as `[-1, -1]`.
         - `new_segment` is initialized as an empty list, which is not consistent with the logic of tracking the current segment sum and its starting index.
       - **Logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment`:**
         - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. For example, it does not correctly handle the case where a new segment starts with a negative number.
         - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which can lead to incorrect results.
         - The function does not handle the case where the entire array is negative correctly.
       - **Final State and Return:**
         - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` even if they are not valid segments.
         - The function returns `total_max_segment`, which is a list. If `total_max_segment` has only one element, it is `[-1]`. Otherwise, it is the list from `segments_variants` with the highest sum, including the sum of the positive segment, the indices of the first and last elements in that segment, and the additional value `len(arr) - 1`.
     - Given these issues, `func_2` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem.

   - **Main Program:**
     - The main program reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_2` to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
     - If the maximum sum is `-1`, it sets it to `0`.
     - It then calculates the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` and applies the modulo operation using `func_1`.
     - **Flaw in the Formula:**
       - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` is incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the maximum sum of the array after `k` operations, which involves repeatedly adding the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
       - The formula assumes that the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is always positive, which is not necessarily true.
       - The formula also does not handle the case where the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative correctly.

3. **Overall Program Correctness:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it fails to do so due to the issues mentioned.
   - The main program uses an incorrect formula to calculate the final answer.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described. The function `func_2` has logical errors, and the main program uses an incorrect formula to compute the final answer.

Final: **False**
