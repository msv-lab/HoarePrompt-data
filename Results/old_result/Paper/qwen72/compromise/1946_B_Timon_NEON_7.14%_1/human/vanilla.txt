- The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it fails to do so due to the issues mentioned.
   - The function `func_3` is incomplete and does not contribute to solving the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness:
