Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list; `max_segment` is a list containing the sum of the maximum positive segment and the index of the last element in that segment; `segments_variants` is a list of lists, each containing the sum of a positive segment and the indices of the first and last elements in that segment, with an additional list appended that contains the elements of `max_segment` plus the value `len(arr) - 1`, and another list appended that is `new_segment` plus the value `len(arr) - 1`; `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation:
- `new_segment` remains an empty list.
- `max_segment` remains a list containing the sum of the maximum positive segment and the index of the last element in that segment.
- `segments_variants` now has an additional list appended, which is the concatenation of `new_segment` (an empty list) and `[len(arr) - 1]`. This means the new list appended is `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- `max_sum` remains -1.
