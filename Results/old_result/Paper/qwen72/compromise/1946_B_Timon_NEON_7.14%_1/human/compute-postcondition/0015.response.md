Output State: **The program returns `total_max_segment`, which is a list. If `total_max_segment` has only one element, it is `[-1]`. Otherwise, it is the list from `segments_variants` with the highest sum, including the sum of the positive segment, the indices of the first and last elements in that segment, and the additional value `len(arr) - 1`.**
