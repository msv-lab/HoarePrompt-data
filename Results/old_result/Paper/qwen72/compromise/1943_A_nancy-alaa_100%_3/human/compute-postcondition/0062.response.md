The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 0, `n + 1` is at least 2, which means the loop can execute again as long as `i` is 2 and `n + 1` is greater than 2.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `i` is 2, `n + 1` must be greater than 2**
