Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the code snippet).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n + 1` must be greater than 2, which implies `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n` is an integer greater than 0).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
   - The condition `n + 1 > 2` is satisfied, meaning `n` is at least 2.
   - The code snippet does not modify `i` or any other variables.
   - The `print(i)` statement will simply print the value of `i`.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is explicitly set to 2, the `print(i)` statement will print the integer 2.

Output: **2**
