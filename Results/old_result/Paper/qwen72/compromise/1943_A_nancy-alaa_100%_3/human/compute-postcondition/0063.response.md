Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1: This variable is not used in the code snippet.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0: This means `n` is a positive integer.
   - `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user: This means `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`: This means `mpp` is a dictionary-like object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `arr`.
   - `i` is 2: This variable is explicitly set to 2.
   - `n + 1` must be greater than 2: This condition implies that `n` must be at least 2 (since `n + 1 > 2` simplifies to `n > 1`).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 2.
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the value of `i` is 2, and this is what will be printed.

Output: **2**
