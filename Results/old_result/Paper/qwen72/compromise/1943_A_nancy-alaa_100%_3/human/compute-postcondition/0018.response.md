Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is an input integer greater than 0 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user (though this list is not used in the print statement).
- `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr` (though this object is not used in the print statement).
- `first` is False (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
- `i` is 1.

The print statement is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since `i` is explicitly set to 1, the print statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
