Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 0, and `i` is not a key in the `mpp` dictionary. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
