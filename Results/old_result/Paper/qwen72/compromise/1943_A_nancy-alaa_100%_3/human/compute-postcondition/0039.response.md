Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `first` is True if there exists at least one integer in the new `arr` that appears exactly once and is less than or equal to the new value of `n`, otherwise `first` remains False.**

The code `mpp = Counter(arr)` updates the `mpp` variable to be a `Counter` object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the `arr` list. The values of `_`, `n`, `arr`, and `first` remain unchanged.
