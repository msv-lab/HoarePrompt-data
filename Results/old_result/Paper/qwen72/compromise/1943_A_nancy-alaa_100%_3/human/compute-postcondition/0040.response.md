Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `first` is False.**

The value of `first` is explicitly set to `False`, overriding any previous condition. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state retains their initial values.
