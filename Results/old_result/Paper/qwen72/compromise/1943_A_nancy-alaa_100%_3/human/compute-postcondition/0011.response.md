To determine what will be printed by the `print(i)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `_` is 0.
2. `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
3. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
4. `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`.
5. `first` is True.
6. `i` is in the keys of `mpp` with `mpp[i]` equal to 1.

Given these conditions, `i` is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`. The `print(i)` statement will print this integer.

Since the exact value of `i` depends on the user's input for `arr`, we can't determine a specific numerical value for `i`. However, we know that `i` is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`.

Output: **i (where i is an integer that appears exactly once in the list `arr`)**
