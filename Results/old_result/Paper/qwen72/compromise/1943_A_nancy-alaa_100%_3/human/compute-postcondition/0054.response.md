Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1 (This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for now).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user.
   - `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `first` is either True or False depending on the condition inside the loop (This variable is not used in the `print` statement, so we can ignore it for now).

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement simply prints the value of the variable `i`.
   - According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 1.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **1**
