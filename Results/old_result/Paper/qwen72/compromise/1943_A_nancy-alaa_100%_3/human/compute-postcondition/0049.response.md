Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `arr` is a new list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in the new `arr`, `first` is False, `i` is 0. If `i` is a key in the `mpp` dictionary and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.***
