Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `mpp` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`, `i` is `n + 1`, and `first` is True if there was at least one integer in `arr` that appeared exactly once and was encountered before any integer that appeared more than once. Otherwise, `first` remains False.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n` (inclusive).
- During each iteration, the loop checks if `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`. If `i` is not in `mpp`, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
- If `i` is in `mpp` and `mpp[i] == 1`, it sets `first` to True.
- If `i` is in `mpp`, `mpp[i] == 1`, and `first` is already True, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop.
- If neither of these conditions is met, the loop continues to the next iteration.
- After all iterations, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from `0` to `n`.
- The variable `first` will be True if there was at least one integer in `arr` that appeared exactly once and was encountered before any integer that appeared more than once. Otherwise, `first` remains False.
