### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Alice appends the chosen element to `c` and both delete the chosen element from `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always choose the smallest integer that is not in `c` and is present in `a` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will always choose the smallest integer that is in `a` to minimize the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `n` to find the smallest integer `i` that either:
     - Does not appear in `arr` (i.e., `i not in mpp.keys()`).
     - Appears exactly once in `arr` and is the first such integer encountered (i.e., `mpp[i] == 1 and first`).
   - If no such integer is found, it prints the first integer that appears exactly once.

4. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - **MEX Calculation:** The program correctly identifies the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or appears exactly once.
   - **Optimal Play:** The program assumes that both players play optimally. Alice will always choose the smallest integer not in `c` and Bob will choose the smallest integer in `a`.
   - **Edge Cases:** The program handles edge cases where `arr` contains all integers from 0 to `n-1` or where all integers appear more than once.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` by checking the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or appears exactly once.
   - The logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by always choosing the smallest available integer.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` given the optimal play of Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
