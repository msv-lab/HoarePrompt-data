The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` starts from 1.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start from 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list where the first element is 0 and the subsequent elements are the integers input by the user, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where all elements are 0, each element of `c` is a positive integer, and each query is a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`.**
