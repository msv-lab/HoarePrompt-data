The code snippet `n, q = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the variables `n` and `q`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, and the function `func_1` is expected to be called with parameters for the number of test cases, the array `c`, and the queries. Each element of `c` is a positive integer, and each query is a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`.**
