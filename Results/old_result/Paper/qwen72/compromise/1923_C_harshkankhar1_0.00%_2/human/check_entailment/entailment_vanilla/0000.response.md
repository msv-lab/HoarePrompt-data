### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a subarray of `c` is "good." A subarray is good if there exists another array `b` of the same length such that:
     - The sum of elements in the subarray of `c` is equal to the sum of elements in the corresponding subarray of `b`.
     - For every index `i` in the subarray, `c[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` and processes `q` queries.

3. **Array `b` Construction:**
   - The program constructs an array `b` where each element is either 1 or 2, depending on whether the corresponding element in `c` is greater than 1.
   - This ensures that `b[i]` is always positive and different from `c[i]` (since `c[i]` is at least 1).

4. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program uses the `accumulate` function to create prefix sum arrays for both `a` and `b`.
   - `a` is the prefix sum array of `c`.
   - `b` is the prefix sum array of the constructed array `b`.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`.
   - If the sum of `c[l_i...r_i]` is less than the sum of `b[l_i...r_i]` or if `l_i` is equal to `r_i`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l_i` is equal to `r_i` by printing "NO" because a single-element subarray cannot be good (it cannot have a different positive element).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of the subarray `c[l_i...r_i]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`, which means it's impossible to construct a valid `b`.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of prefix sum arrays allows the program to answer each query in constant time, making it efficient for large inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and uses efficient data structures to ensure the solution is optimal.
