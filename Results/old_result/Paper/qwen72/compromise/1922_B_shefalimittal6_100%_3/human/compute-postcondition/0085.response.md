Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` remains the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `t` remains `t - 1`, `idx` remains `n + n + 3`, `data` remains a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` remains a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` remains a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each `v[x]` (for each `x` read from `data` starting from index `n + 3` to `n + n + 2`) is incremented by 1, `cnt` is `cnt + v[2]`, `x` remains the integer value of `data[n + n + 2]`, `_` remains `n - 1`. If `v[2]` is at least 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[2] * (v[2] - 1) * (v[2] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt += v[i]` increments the value of `cnt` by the value of `v[2]`.
- The value of `i` is 2, so `v[i]` is `v[2]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
