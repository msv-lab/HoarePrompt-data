Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 4, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[4])`.**

The value of `x` is updated to the integer value of `data[4]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
