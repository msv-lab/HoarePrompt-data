The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and the loop counter `_`. The loop counter `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, but it is incremented implicitly with each iteration of the loop. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` must be greater than 0, and the loop counter `_` must be less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is `t - 1`
- `idx` is `n + 4`
- `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer
- `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`
- `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 1
- `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0
- `cnt` is 0
- `i` is `n`
- `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`

Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly mentioned, we focus on `n`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must remain greater than 0, and the loop counter `_` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]` and must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[n + 3]`, `_` is incremented by 1**
