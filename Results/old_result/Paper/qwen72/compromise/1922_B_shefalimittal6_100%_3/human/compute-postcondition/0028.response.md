Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, and `ans` is 0. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated to `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
