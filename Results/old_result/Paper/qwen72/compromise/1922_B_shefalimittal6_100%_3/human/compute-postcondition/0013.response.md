Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 3, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where `v[x]` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is a positive integer equal to `int(data[2])`**

The value of `v[x]` is incremented by 1, so `v[x]` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
