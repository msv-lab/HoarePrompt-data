Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `idx` is `n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is a list containing a single string representation of `ans`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]`, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`, and `ans` is the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 elements from the elements in `v` that are greater than or equal to 2 and 3, respectively.**
