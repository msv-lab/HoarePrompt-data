The code snippet `ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of the expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `idx` is `n + 2`.
   - `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `cnt` is `v[1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is 0 if `v[1]` is less than 3. If `v[1]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `v[1] * (v[1] - 1) * (v[1] - 2) // 6`.

2. **Expression Calculation:**
   - `cnt` is `v[1]`.
   - `v[i]` is `v[1]` since `i` is 1.
   - The expression `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` simplifies to `v[1] * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2`.

3. **Update `ans`:**
   - `ans` is updated by adding the result of `v[1] * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2`.

4. **Final Output State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `idx` is `n + 2`.
   - `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `cnt` is `v[1]`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is now `ans + v[1] * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings where `data[1]` is a string that can be converted to a positive integer, `results` is an empty list, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1` where each element `v[x]` (where `x` is an integer from `int(data[2])` to `int(data[n + 1])`) is incremented by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `cnt` is `v[1]`, `i` is 1, and `ans` is `ans + v[1] * v[1] * (v[1] - 1) // 2`.**
