The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and calculates the number of ways to pick 2 or 3 sticks with the same exponent of length. It then prints the results for each test case, one per line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` is 0, `idx` is equal to the length of the input data, `results` contains the string representations of the calculated answers for each test case, and the variables `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `x`, and `ans` are in their final states as described in the annotated code.
