Output State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `len` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of characters from the input string, `ret` is 0.** 

The variable `ret` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`int(input())`, `_`, `len`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
