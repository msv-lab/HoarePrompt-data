Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list, `ret` is 0. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0, and `i` is not '*' and is not '@'.***
