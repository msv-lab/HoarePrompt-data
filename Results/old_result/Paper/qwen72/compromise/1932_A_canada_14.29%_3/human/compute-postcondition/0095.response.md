Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, `ret` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `len` is the integer value of the input, and `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0 and `i` is not equal to '*' or '@'.***
