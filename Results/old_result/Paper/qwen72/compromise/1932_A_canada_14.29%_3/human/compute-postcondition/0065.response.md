Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list, `ret` is 0 if the first character is not '@', otherwise `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` remains 0 if the first character is not '*' and is not '@', and the condition `thorn == 0` is checked and remains true.***
