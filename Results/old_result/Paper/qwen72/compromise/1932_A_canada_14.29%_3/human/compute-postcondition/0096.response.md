Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, `ret` is 1 if `i` is `@`, otherwise `ret` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `len` is the integer value of the input, and `thorn` is 0 unless `i` is `*` and `thorn` is set to 1 or 2. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
