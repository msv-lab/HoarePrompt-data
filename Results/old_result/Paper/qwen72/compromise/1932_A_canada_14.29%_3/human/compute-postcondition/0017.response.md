Postcondition: ***`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, and `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to '*' and `thorn` is 0.***
