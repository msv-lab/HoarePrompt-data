Output State: **`s` is a list of characters from the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is 1, and if `thorn` reaches 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `i` is not equal to '@' or '*', and `thorn` remains 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
