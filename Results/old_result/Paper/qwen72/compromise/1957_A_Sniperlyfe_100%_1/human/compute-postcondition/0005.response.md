Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list represents a test case with the number of sticks and their lengths. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each unique test case by 3. After the function concludes, the input list `arr` remains unchanged, and the function provides a single integer value representing the total number of complete groups of three identical test cases found in `arr`. **
