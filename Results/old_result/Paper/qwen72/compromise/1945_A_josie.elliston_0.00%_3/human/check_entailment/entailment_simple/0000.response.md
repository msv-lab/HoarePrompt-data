### Reasoning:

1. **Introverts Handling**:
   - Each introvert requires a separate tent. This is directly handled by adding `introverts` to the total tent count.

2. **Extroverts and Universals Handling**:
   - Extroverts need to be in a tent with exactly two other people. This means that for every 3 extroverts, we need 1 tent.
   - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, we need to check if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with universals. If the sum of the remaining extroverts and universals is less than 3, it is impossible to accommodate them according to the rules, and the function should return `None`.

3. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the available universals. If not, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of `extroverts` and `universals` by 3, which ensures that all extroverts and universals are accommodated in the minimum number of tents.

4. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals, so `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The test cases provided in the example are correctly handled by the program:
     - For `1 2 3`, the program correctly outputs `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals).
     - For `1 4 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1` (impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals).
     - For `1 4 2`, the program correctly outputs `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 2 universals).
     - For `1 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `-1` (impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals).
     - For `1 3 2`, the program correctly outputs `3` (1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for 2 universals).
     - For `19 7 18`, the program correctly outputs `28` (19 tents for introverts, 2 tents for 6 extroverts, and 1 tent for 1 extrovert and 2 universals, plus the remaining 16 universals in 6 tents).
     - For `0 0 0`, the program correctly outputs `0` (no participants).
     - For `7 0 0`, the program correctly outputs `7` (7 tents for introverts).
     - For `0 24 0`, the program correctly outputs `8` (8 tents for 24 extroverts).
     - For `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the program correctly outputs `1666666667` (1000000000 tents for introverts, and 666666667 tents for the remaining extroverts and universals).

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles all the test cases and follows the problem description accurately. It ensures that introverts are given their own tents, and it checks if the remaining extroverts can be accommodated with the available universals, returning `-1` if it is impossible. The logic and the implementation are correct.
