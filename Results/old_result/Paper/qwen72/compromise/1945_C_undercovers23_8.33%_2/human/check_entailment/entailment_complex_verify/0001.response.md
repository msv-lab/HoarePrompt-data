### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents. This part is accurate and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Initial Setup**: The program calculates the midpoint `pk` of the village, which is used to determine the optimal position of the road. It also counts the total number of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`) in the string `s`. This setup is correct and necessary for the subsequent calculations.

3. **Iterating Through Possible Positions**: The program iterates through all possible positions `i` where the road can be placed (from 0 to `n-1`). For each position, it calculates the number of '0's (`zero`) and '1's (`one`) on the left side of the road and the remaining '1's on the right side. This iteration is necessary to check all possible positions.

4. **Checking Conditions**: The program checks if the current position `i` satisfies the condition that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied. This is done by calculating the percentage of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side and ensuring both percentages are at least 50%. However, the use of percentages (multiplying by 100) is unnecessary and can introduce floating-point precision issues. Instead, the program should directly compare the counts to the required thresholds.

5. **Storing Valid Positions**: If a position `i` satisfies the conditions, it is added to the list `lst`. This is a correct approach to collect all valid positions.

6. **Finding the Optimal Position**: The program then finds the position in `lst` that is closest to the midpoint `pk`. If there are multiple such positions, it selects the smallest one. This part is implemented correctly.

7. **Handling Edge Cases**: If no valid positions are found, the program checks if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the conditions. It appends the appropriate position (0 or `n`) to the list `final`. This handling of edge cases is correct and necessary.

8. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the first element of the sorted list `final`, which is the optimal position for the road. This is the correct way to output the result.

### Issues Found:
- **Percentage Calculation**: The use of percentages (multiplying by 100) is unnecessary and can introduce floating-point precision issues. Instead, the program should directly compare the counts to the required thresholds. For example, instead of `zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, it should use `zero_count = zero >= (i + 1) // 2` and similarly for the right side.

### Final Evaluation:
Despite the unnecessary use of percentages, the program still correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases. The core logic and flow of the program are correct.

Final: **True**
