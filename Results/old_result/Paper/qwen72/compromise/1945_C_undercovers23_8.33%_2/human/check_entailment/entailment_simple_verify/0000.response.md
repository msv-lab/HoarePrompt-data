### Reasoning:

1. **Percentage Calculation Issue:**
   - The program calculates `zero_perc` and `one_perc` using percentages, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect comparisons. The problem requires checking if at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied, which can be done directly by comparing counts.
   - For example, instead of calculating `zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, it should simply check if `zero >= (i + 1) // 2`.
   - Similarly, instead of `one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, it should check if `(o - one) >= (n - i - 1) // 2`.

2. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house correctly. The logic for these edge cases is flawed.
   - Specifically, the program should check if placing the road before the first house (i.e., `i = 0`) or after the last house (i.e., `i = n`) satisfies the conditions. This is not done in the current implementation.

3. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     1
     5
     11000
     ```
   - The expected output is `2`, but the program might output a different value due to the issues mentioned above.
   - If the road is placed after the second house (`i = 2`), the left side has 2 houses with 1 resident wanting to live on the left side, and the right side has 3 houses with 2 residents wanting to live on the right side. Both conditions are satisfied.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach should directly check the counts of satisfied residents on both sides without converting to percentages.
   - It should also handle the edge cases correctly by checking if placing the road before the first house or after the last house satisfies the conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in the percentage calculation and edge case handling, the original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
