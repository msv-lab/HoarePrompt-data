Postcondition: ***`one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `lst` is [1]. If `s[i] == '0'`, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0 or 1, otherwise `zero` is 1 or 0 and `one` is 1. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to [1, 2].***
