Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `zero` is the total count of '0's in the string `s`, `one` is the total count of '1's in the string `s`, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 1) - 1))` which simplifies to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / 0)` (this will raise an error if `o - one` is not 0), `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were at least 50 during the loop execution, `i` is `n - 2`, and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes `n`.
Code of the loop:
for ele in lst:
    mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`, `lst` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and `ele`; `lst` must contain at least two elements; `ele` is the next element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mini` is updated to the minimum value between its original value and the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element in the list (`ele`). `lst` must contain at least three elements; `ele` is the third element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
