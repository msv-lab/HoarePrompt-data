The code `final.append(elem)` adds the third element of `lst` (denoted as `elem`) to the list `final`.

Given the initial state:
- `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`.
- `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` of `lst` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` contains the first element of `lst`.
- If the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element `elem` of `lst` is also equal to `mini`, then `final` contains both the first and the second elements of `lst`.
- `lst` has at least 3 elements, and `elem` is the third element in `lst`.

After executing the code:
- `final` now includes the third element of `lst` (denoted as `elem`).

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` contains the first, second, and third elements of `lst` if their absolute differences with `pk` are all equal to `mini`. `lst` has at least 3 elements, and `elem` is the third element in `lst`.**
