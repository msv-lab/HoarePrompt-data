To determine what will be printed by the `print(final[0])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`.
   - `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If the length of `final` is 0:
     - The length of `final` is set to 1.
     - If `c1` (which is equal to `(o * 100) // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the element `0`.
     - If `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes the element `n`.
   - If the length of `final` is not 0, `final` remains unchanged.

3. **Determine the Value of `final[0]`:**
   - First, check the length of `final`.
   - If `final` is not empty, `final[0]` will be the first element of the sorted list `final`.
   - If `final` is empty, it will be modified based on the value of `c1`:
     - If `c1 >= 50`, `final` will be `[0]`.
     - If `c1 < 50`, `final` will be `[n]`.

Given these conditions, the value of `final[0]` will be:
- The first element of the sorted list `final` if `final` is not empty.
- `0` if `final` is initially empty and `c1 >= 50`.
- `n` if `final` is initially empty and `c1 < 50`.

Since the exact values of `lst`, `pk`, `o`, and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the output based on the conditions given.

Output: **final[0] (where final[0] is the first element of the sorted list `final` if it is not empty, 0 if `final` is empty and `c1 >= 50`, or `n` if `final` is empty and `c1 < 50`)**
