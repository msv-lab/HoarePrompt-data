Postcondition: ***`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is 1. If `c1` (which is equal to `(o * 100) // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, `final` includes the element `0`. If `c1` is less than 50, `final` includes the element `n`.***
