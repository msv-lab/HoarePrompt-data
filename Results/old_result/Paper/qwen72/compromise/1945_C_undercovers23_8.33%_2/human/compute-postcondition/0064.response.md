Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is the total number of '0's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `one` is the total number of '1's encountered in the string `s` up to the second-to-last character, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is 0.**
