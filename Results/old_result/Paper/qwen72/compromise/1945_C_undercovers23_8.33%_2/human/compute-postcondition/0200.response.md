Postcondition: ***`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` contains the first, second, and third elements of `lst` if the absolute difference between `pk` and each of these elements is equal to `mini`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the third element `elem` of `lst` is not equal to `mini`, `final` contains the first and second elements of `lst` if their absolute differences with `pk` are equal to `mini`. `lst` has at least 3 elements, and `elem` is the third element in `lst`.***
