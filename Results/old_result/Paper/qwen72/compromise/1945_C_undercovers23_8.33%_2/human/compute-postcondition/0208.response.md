Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is 1. `c1` is equal to `(o * 100) // n`. `c1` is less than 50. `final` now contains the element `n`.**
