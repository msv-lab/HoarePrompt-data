Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 or 0, `one` is 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.** 

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `one_perc` using the formula `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `one_perc` depends on the current values of `o`, `one`, `n`, and `i`.
