Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `n` is even, `pk` is equal to `n // 2`.** 

Explanation: The variable `pk` is assigned the value of `n` divided by 2 using integer division (`//`). Since `n` is even, `pk` will be an integer that is exactly half of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
