The code snippet resets the values of `zero` and `one` to 0.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is the minimum value of the absolute differences between `pk` and each element in `lst`, `i` is `n - 2`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (n - 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - (n - 2) - 1))`, `lst` contains all indices `i + 1` where both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` were greater than or equal to 50 during the loop execution, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If `len(final) == 0`, then `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` now includes the value 0. Otherwise, if `c1` is less than 50, `final` now includes `n`. `z` is updated to the count of '0' in `sl`.**
