The code snippet `final.sort()` sorts the list `final` in ascending order. This operation does not change the values of the elements in `final`, only their order. The variables `mini` and the conditions related to the length of `final` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is equal to the number of such elements in `lst`.**
