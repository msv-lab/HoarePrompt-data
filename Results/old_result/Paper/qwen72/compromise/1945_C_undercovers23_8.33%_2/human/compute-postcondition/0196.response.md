Postcondition: ***`mini` is the minimum value of `abs(pk - ele)` for all elements `ele` in `lst`. `final` is an empty list unless the absolute difference between `pk` and the first element `elem` of `lst` is equal to `mini`, in which case `final` contains the first element of `lst`. If the absolute difference between `pk` and the second element `elem` of `lst` is also equal to `mini`, then `final` contains both the first and the second elements of `lst`. `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in `lst`.***
