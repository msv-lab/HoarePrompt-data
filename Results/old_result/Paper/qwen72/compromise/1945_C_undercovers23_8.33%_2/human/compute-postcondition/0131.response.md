Output State: **`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. `final` is a list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.** 

This means that after all iterations of the loop, `mini` holds the smallest absolute difference found between `pk` and any element in `lst`. The list `final` contains all elements from `lst` that have this minimum absolute difference with `pk`. If no elements in `lst` have an absolute difference equal to `mini`, `final` will be an empty list.
