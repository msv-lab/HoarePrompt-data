Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if s[i] == '0':
        zero += 1
    else:
        one += 1
    zero_perc = math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))
    one_perc = math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))
    if zero_perc >= 50 and one_perc >= 50:
        lst.append(i + 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `lst` is [1], `i` is 0, `zero` is 1 or 0, `one` is 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, the conditions and values remain as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl`, `lst` is [1]. If `s[i] == '0'`, `zero` is 2 and `one` is 0 or 1, otherwise `zero` is 1 or 0 and `one` is 1. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is updated to [1, 2].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `mini` is 100000000, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. If the length of `final` is 0, `final` is updated to contain exactly one element: either `0` if `c1` (calculated as `o * 100 // n`) is greater than or equal to 50, or `n` otherwise. `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' characters in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' characters in `sl` (increased by 1 if `s[i] == '0'`). If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, `lst` is [1, 2], otherwise `lst` is [1, i + 1]. `i` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `n - 1`. `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / (i + 1))`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
