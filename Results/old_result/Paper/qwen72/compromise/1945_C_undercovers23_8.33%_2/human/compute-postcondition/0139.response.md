Postcondition: ***`mini` is the minimum absolute difference between `pk` and any element in `lst`. `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. The length of `final` is 1. `c1` is equal to `o * 100 // n`. If `c1` is greater than or equal to 50, `final` also contains the element `0`. Otherwise, `final` contains the element `n`.***
