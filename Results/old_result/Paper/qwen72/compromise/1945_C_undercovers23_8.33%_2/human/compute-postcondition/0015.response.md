To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is the loop variable that will take values from 0 to `n - 2` (inclusive).
   - Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.

2. **Variable `n`:**
   - The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1.
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `zero` is 0, `one` is 0, `lst` is an empty list, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 0**
