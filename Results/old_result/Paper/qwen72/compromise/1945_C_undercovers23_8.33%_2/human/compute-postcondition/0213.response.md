The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. It accepts no direct parameters but expects input data structured as follows: 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer representing the number of houses, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5.
- `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information. Based on the typical structure of such functions, it likely returns some form of processed data or analysis based on the input strings `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) and a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns a result for each test case, with the total number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 2·10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 3·10^5.**
