Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 2, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and 0 otherwise plus 1, `one` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 2)`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`. If `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50, then `lst` is `[2]` and `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list and `final` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `zero` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `lst` and `final` remain the same as they depend on the updated value of `zero_perc` which is recalculated based on the new value of `zero`.
