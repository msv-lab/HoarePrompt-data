Output State: **`one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the number of times '1' appears in `sl`, `z` is the number of times '0' appears in `sl`, `mini` is 100000000, `i` is 2, `zero` is 3 or 2, `one` is 0 or 1, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(2 * 100 / (i + 1))` or `math.ceil(1 * 100 / (i + 1))`, and `lst` is a list containing `[1, 2]` if `zero_perc` is greater than or equal to 50 and `one_perc` is greater than or equal to 50. Otherwise, `lst` remains an empty list.**

Explanation:
- The value of `zero` is incremented by 1, so if it was initially 2, it becomes 3, and if it was initially 1, it becomes 2.
- All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
