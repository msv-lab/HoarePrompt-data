Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input string, `pk` is `n // 2`, `sl` is a list of characters from `s`, `o` is the count of '1' in `sl`, `z` is the count of '0' in `sl`, `mini` is `100000000`, `i` is 1, `zero` is 1 if `s[0]` is '0' and 0 otherwise, `one` is 0 if `s[0]` is '0' and 1 otherwise, `zero_perc` is `math.ceil(zero * 100 / 2)`, `one_perc` is `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`, `lst` is an empty list, `final` is a sorted list containing all elements from `lst` whose absolute difference with `pk` is equal to `mini`, `c1` is `o * 100 // n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `one_perc` is updated to `math.ceil((o - one) * 100 / (n - i - 1))`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
