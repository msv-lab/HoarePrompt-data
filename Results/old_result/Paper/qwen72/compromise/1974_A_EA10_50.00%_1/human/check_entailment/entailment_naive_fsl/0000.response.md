Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the variable `a` is used in the condition `if m < a:` which should be `if m < x:` instead. This mistake can lead to incorrect calculations and outputs. 

Here is a test case where the program fails:
- Input: 
  ```
  1
  12 4
  ```
- Expected Output: 
  ```
  2
  ```
- Actual Output: 
  ```
  3
  ```

The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required because it uses the number of test cases `a` instead of the number of 1x1 icons `x` in the condition `if m < a:`. This leads to an incorrect result.
