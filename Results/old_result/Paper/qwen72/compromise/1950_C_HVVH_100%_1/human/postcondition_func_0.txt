The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. Instead, it reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of time conversions to perform. For each of the `n` iterations, it reads a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) from the user input, converts it to 12-hour format, and prints the converted time followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. The function does not modify any external state or variables, and it only affects the local variables `h`, `m`, and `day` within each iteration.
