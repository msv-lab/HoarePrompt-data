Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading a time string in 24-hour format during each iteration. This matches the problem description.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - **Midnight (00:00 to 11:59)**: For times from 00:00 to 11:59, the function correctly sets the hour to 12 if it is 00, and keeps the hour as is otherwise. It also correctly sets the `day` to 'AM'.
   - **Noon (12:00 to 12:59)**: For times from 12:00 to 12:59, the function correctly sets the `day` to 'PM' and keeps the hour as 12.
   - **Afternoon and Evening (13:00 to 23:59)**: For times from 13:00 to 23:59, the function correctly subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the `day` to 'PM'.

3. **Output Formatting**: The function prints the time in the correct 12-hour format with leading zeros for hours and minutes, followed by 'AM' or 'PM'. This matches the output format specified in the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **00:00**: The function correctly converts this to 12:00 AM.
   - **12:00**: The function correctly converts this to 12:00 PM.
   - **23:59**: The function correctly converts this to 11:59 PM.

5. **Loop and Iteration**: The function correctly handles the loop for `n` test cases, and the state of the program is as expected after each iteration.

Given these points, the function appears to correctly implement the required functionality and handle all edge cases as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
