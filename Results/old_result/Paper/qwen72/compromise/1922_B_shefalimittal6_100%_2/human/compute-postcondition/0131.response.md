The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each inner list contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. 

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to form a rectangle using the given sticks, and returns "YES" if it is possible, or "NO" otherwise.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists. Each inner list contains an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of the sticks. The function returns a list of strings, where each string is "YES" if it is possible to form a rectangle with the given sticks in the corresponding test case, or "NO" otherwise.**
