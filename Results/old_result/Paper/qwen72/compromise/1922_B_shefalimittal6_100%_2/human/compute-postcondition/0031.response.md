Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.***
