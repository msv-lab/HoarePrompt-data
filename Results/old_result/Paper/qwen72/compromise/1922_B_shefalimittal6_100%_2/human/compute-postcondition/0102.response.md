Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + 7`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by 2, `cnt` is 0, `i` is `n`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, and `ans` is 0.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from `n + n + 6` to `n + n + 7`. All other variables remain unchanged.
