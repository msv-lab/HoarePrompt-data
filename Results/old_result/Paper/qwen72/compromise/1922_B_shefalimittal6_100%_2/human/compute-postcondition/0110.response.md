Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0 but less than the previous value, `idx` is `n + n + n + 4`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans` and an additional string representation of `ans`, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `v[x]` incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, and `ans` is 0. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, then `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2.***
