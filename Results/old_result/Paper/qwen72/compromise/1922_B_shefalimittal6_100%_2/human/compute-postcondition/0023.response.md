Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, each string being a part of the input data split by spaces, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each `v[x]` is incremented by the number of times the corresponding integer `x` appears in `data` from index 2 to `n + 1`, `cnt` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variable `cnt` which is set to 0.
