The value of `ans` is updated by adding the result of the expression `v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6` to its current value. The current value of `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, so the expression calculates the number of combinations of `v[i]` taken 3 at a time. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, and `ans` is now `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2 + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**
