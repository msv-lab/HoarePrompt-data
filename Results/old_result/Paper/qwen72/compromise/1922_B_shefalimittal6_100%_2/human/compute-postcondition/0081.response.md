Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + n + 3`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is a list containing the string representation of `ans`, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[1] + v[i]`, `i` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
- `cnt` is `cnt + v[1] + v[i]`, and `i` is 2.
- `v[i]` is the value at index `i` in the list `v`, which is a list of `n + 1` zeros with each element at index `x` incremented by the number of times `x` appears in `data[n+3:n+n+3]`.
- `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
