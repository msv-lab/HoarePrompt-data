Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans + (cnt * v[2] * (v[2] - 1) // 2)`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[1]`**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated to `ans + (cnt * v[2] * (v[2] - 1) // 2)`.
- `cnt` is already `cnt + v[1]` from the initial state, and this value is used in the calculation for `ans`.
- All other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
