Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 4, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 1, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where `v[x]` is now 2, `x` is the integer value of the string at `data[4]`**

Explanation: The code `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of the string at `data[4]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
