Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is `cnt + v[1]`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `cnt += v[i]` updates the value of `cnt` by adding `v[i]` to it. Since `i` is 1, `v[1]` is accessed. Given that `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `v[1]` is 0. Therefore, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + 0`, which means `cnt` remains unchanged. All other variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid.
