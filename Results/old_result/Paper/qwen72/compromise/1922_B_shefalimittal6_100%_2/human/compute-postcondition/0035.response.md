Postcondition: ***`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is `n + 2`, `data` is a list of strings, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i]`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `cnt` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `cnt` is updated to `cnt + v[i]`.***
