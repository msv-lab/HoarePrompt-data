The function should take two parameters: a and b, which are binary strings consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the lengths of a and b (n and m respectively) are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function should return the maximum k for each test case, where k is the length of the longest prefix of a that is a subsequence of b.
