#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a and b, which are binary strings consisting only of the characters '0' and '1'. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the lengths of a and b (n and m respectively) are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function should return the maximum k for each test case, where k is the length of the longest prefix of a that is a subsequence of b.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `k` is the number of characters in `b` that match a character in `a` in the same order, and `j` is the index of the next character in `b` that has not been matched or `m` if all characters in `b` have been matched.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the number of characters in `b` that match a character in `a` in the same order)
    return
    #The program returns nothing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, followed by two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates and prints the maximum length `k` of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. The function does not return any value.
