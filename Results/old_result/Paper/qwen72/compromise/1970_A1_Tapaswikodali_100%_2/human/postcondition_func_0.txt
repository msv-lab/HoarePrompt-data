The function `func_1` accepts two objects, `infoA` and `infoB`, each with attributes `balance` and `position`. If the `balance` values of `infoA` and `infoB` are different, it returns the difference between their `balance` values. If the `balance` values are the same, it returns the difference between their `position` values. The function does not modify the input objects.
