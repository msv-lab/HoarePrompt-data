You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged. The loop prints the result of the conditional logic for each test case, but does not modify the values of t, n, a, or b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by three integers `A`, `B`, and `C`. For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on the following conditions: if `B * 2` is less than `C`, it prints `A * B`; if `A` is even, it prints `A * C / 2` (as an integer); if `A` is odd, it prints `(A // 2) * C + B`. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` provided before the function call. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cost**:
   - The program checks if buying two yogurts at the regular price (`B * 2`) is cheaper than buying them at the promotion price (`C`).
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `A * B`.
   - If buying two yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper or equal to buying them individually, it proceeds to calculate the minimum cost:
     - If `A` is even, it means Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, so the total cost is `A * C / 2`.
     - If `A` is odd, it means Maxim can buy `A // 2` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price, so the total cost is `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated minimum cost for each test case.

4. **Verification with Example**:
   - For the first test case: `2 5 9`
     - `A = 2`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is not less than `C = 9`, the program calculates `A * C / 2 = 2 * 9 / 2 = 9`.
   - For the second test case: `3 5 9`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 9`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is not less than `C = 9`, the program calculates `X = 3 // 2 = 1` and `X * C + B = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
   - For the third test case: `3 5 11`
     - `A = 3`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the program calculates `A * B = 3 * 5 = 15`.
   - For the fourth test case: `4 5 11`
     - `A = 4`, `B = 5`, `C = 11`
     - Since `B * 2 = 10` is less than `C = 11`, the program calculates `A * B = 4 * 5 = 20`.

The program correctly handles the logic for determining the minimum cost based on the given conditions and produces the correct output for the provided example.
