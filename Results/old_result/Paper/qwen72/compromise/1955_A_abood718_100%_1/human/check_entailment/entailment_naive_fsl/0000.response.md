Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts is equal to or greater than the price of buying two yogurts at the regular price. In such cases, the program should always choose the regular price, but it does not do so correctly.

Example of incorrect behavior:
- Input: `2 5 10`
- Expected Output: `10`
- Actual Output: `10` (This is correct, but the logic is flawed and will fail in other cases.)

Another example:
- Input: `3 5 10`
- Expected Output: `15`
- Actual Output: `20` (This is incorrect. The program should output 15, as it is more advantageous to buy three yogurts at the regular price of 5 burles each rather than using the promotion price for two yogurts and buying one at the regular price.)

The program should compare the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price with the promotion price and use the cheaper option. The current logic does not always ensure this.
