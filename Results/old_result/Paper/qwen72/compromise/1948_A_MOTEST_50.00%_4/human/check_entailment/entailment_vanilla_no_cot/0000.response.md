Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**: The program checks if `n` is 1. If `n` is 1, it prints "NO" because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a special character must have at least one neighbor, and having exactly one special character would mean it must be equal to both neighbors, which is not possible.

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string by repeating each letter from the alphabet twice, ensuring that each pair of repeated letters forms a special character.
   - If `n` is odd, the program starts with "AAA" to ensure the first three characters are special, and then continues to repeat each subsequent letter from the alphabet twice. This ensures that the total number of special characters is `n`.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be formed, and "NO" if `n` is 1.

The program meets all the requirements and constraints specified in the problem description, and it correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1. Therefore, the program is correct.
