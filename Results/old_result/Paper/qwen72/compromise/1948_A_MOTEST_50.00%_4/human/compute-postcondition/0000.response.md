The code `os.system('cls')` clears the console screen. This operation does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the console screen cleared.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case, and the console screen is cleared.**
