### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads four integers from the input, which represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.

2. **Winning Condition**: The game's winning condition is based on the bitwise XOR of the sequence. If the XOR is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. The key observation here is that the XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the counts of numbers that contribute to the XOR being 1 in each bit position are all even.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**: Eve's goal is to remove numbers in such a way that maximizes the number of times Bob wins. This means Eve should try to make the XOR zero as many times as possible by removing numbers. The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s (considering their binary representations) are all even.

4. **Counting Bob's Wins**:
   - If all counts \(a[0]\), \(a[1]\), \(a[2]\), and \(a[3]\) are odd, then the initial XOR is non-zero, and Bob can win once by removing one number to make one of the counts even.
   - For each number in the sequence, removing two of that number will not change the parity of the XOR (since \(x \oplus x = 0\)). Therefore, the number of times Bob can win by removing pairs of numbers is \(\left\lfloor \frac{a[i]}{2} \right\rfloor\) for each \(i\).

5. **Implementation**:
   - The function initializes `cnt` to 0.
   - It checks if all counts \(a[0]\), \(a[1]\), \(a[2]\) are odd. If they are, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - It then iterates over each count in `a` and adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor\) to `cnt` for each count \(x\).
   - Finally, it prints `cnt` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where all counts are odd, allowing Bob to win once initially.
   - The function correctly handles the case where some counts are even and some are odd, by only considering the floor division of each count by 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The reasoning and the implementation match the problem description and the expected output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
