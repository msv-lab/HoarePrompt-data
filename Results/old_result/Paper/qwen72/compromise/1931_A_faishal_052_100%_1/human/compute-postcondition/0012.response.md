Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer minus 26, `j` is 0, and `lex` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- Since the initial `lex` was between 28 and 51 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from it results in a new `lex` value between 2 and 25 (inclusive).
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `arr`, `j`) remain unchanged.
