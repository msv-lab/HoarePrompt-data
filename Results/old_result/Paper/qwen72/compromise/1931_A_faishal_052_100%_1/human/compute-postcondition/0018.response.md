Postcondition: ***`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 0, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 52, `arr` is [26] and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is either [26] if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or remains an empty list if `lex` is greater than 52.***
