The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range value `2`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute 2 times regardless of the initial value of `j` because the range is fixed from 0 to 1 (which means it will iterate twice). However, for the loop to start correctly, `j` should be initialized to 0, as this is the starting point for the range in Python.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer**
