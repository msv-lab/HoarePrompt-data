Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, and `arr` is [1, 1], [26, 1], [1, 26], [26, 26], or [26, 26] depending on the initial value of `lex`. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is reduced by 2, making `lex` less than 26. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 27, making `lex` greater than or equal to 1 and less than 26. If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` greater than or equal to 0 and less than 26. If `lex` is 78, `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` 26. If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` is reduced by 52, making `lex` greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52.**

### Explanation:
- **`j` is 1**: The loop runs twice (`range(2)`), so `j` will be 1 after both iterations.
- **`arr`**: Depending on the initial value of `lex`, `arr` can end up with different values:
  - If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` will be `[1, 1]` because `lex` is reduced by 1 each iteration.
  - If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 1]` because the first iteration reduces `lex` by 26, and the second iteration reduces it by 1.
  - If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 26]` because `lex` is reduced by 26 each iteration.
  - If `lex` is 78, `arr` will be `[26, 26]` because `lex` is reduced by 26 each iteration.
  - If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` will be `[26, 26]` because `lex` is reduced by 26 each iteration.
- **`lex`**: The final value of `lex` depends on its initial value:
  - If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is reduced by 2, making it less than 26.
  - If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 27, making it greater than or equal to 1 and less than 26.
  - If `lex` is between 52 and 77 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 52, making it greater than or equal to 0 and less than 26.
  - If `lex` is 78, `lex` is reduced by 52, making it 26.
  - If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` is reduced by 52, making it greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52.
