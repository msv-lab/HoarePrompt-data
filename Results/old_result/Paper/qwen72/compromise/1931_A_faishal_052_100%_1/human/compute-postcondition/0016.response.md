Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive), `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since the initial value of `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive), subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a new value of `lex` that is between 26 and 52 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
