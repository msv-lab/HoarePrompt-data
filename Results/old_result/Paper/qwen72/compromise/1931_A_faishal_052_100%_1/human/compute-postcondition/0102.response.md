Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements both of which are the array `[26]`, `j` is 0, `arr` is `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer between 28 and 78 inclusive, and `lex` is now `lex - 26`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, `arr`) remain unchanged.
- Since `lex` was initially between 28 and 78 inclusive, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` is between 2 and 52 inclusive.
