Output State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is updated as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 26]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]`; if `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 52.**

Explanation:
- The value of `lex` is reduced by 26.
- The conditions for updating `arr` are still valid, but the new value of `lex` is used to determine the appropriate value for `arr`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`) remain unchanged.
