Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2. If `lex` is not defined, an error occurs and the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `lex` is defined and less than 28, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `lex` is defined and less than 52, `arr` now contains the integer 26 at the end, and `lex` is reduced by 26. If `lex` is defined and between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is [26], and `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. If `lex` is defined and greater than 78, the variables remain unchanged.***
