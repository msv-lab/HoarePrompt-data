The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`. If `lex` was less than 27, `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` was between 2 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` was greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` was greater than 78, `arr` is `[26]`.**
