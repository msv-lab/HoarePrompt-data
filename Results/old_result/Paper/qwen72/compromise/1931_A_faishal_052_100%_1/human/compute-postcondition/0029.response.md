Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 52, `lex` is updated as follows: If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is reduced by 1, and `arr` is `[1]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is 52, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than 52, `lex` is not modified, and `arr` remains an empty list. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `lex` is not modified, and `arr` remains unchanged.***
