The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the end of the list `arr`. Since `arr` was not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be an existing list before this operation. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements, `j` is 2, `arr` now contains the integer 26 at the end.**
