The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the value 26 to the end of the list `arr`. Given the initial state, the value of `arr` before the operation is `[26, 1]` under certain conditions related to the value of `lex`. After appending 26 to `arr`, the new value of `arr` will be `[26, 1, 26]`.

The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`, and `lex`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`cases` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list containing one element which is the array `arr`, `j` is 2, `arr` is `[26, 1, 26]`, and `lex` is updated to `lex - 1` if `lex` was less than 28 or between 28 and 52 (inclusive), or `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` if `lex` is less than 52, or `lex` is updated to `lex - 26` if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), or `lex` remains unchanged if `lex` is greater than 78.**
