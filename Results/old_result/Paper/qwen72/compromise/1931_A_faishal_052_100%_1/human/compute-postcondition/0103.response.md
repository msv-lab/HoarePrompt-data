Postcondition: ***`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements both of which are the array `[26]` if `lex` is between 28 and 78 inclusive, otherwise `info` remains a list containing two elements both of which are the array `[]`. `j` is 0, `arr` is `[26]` if `lex` is between 28 and 78 inclusive, otherwise `arr` is `[]`. `lex` is an input integer, and if `lex` is between 28 and 78 inclusive, `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.***
