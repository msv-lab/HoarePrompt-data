Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is an empty string, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `temp = ''` reassigns the variable `temp` to an empty string. All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, and `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
