Output State: **`cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is a list that will eventually contain `cases` elements, each of which is a sorted array `arr` with specific conditions as described, `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `chr(info[0][0] + 96)` and `chr(info[0][1] + 96)`, `j` is 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `temp` is updated by appending the character corresponding to `chr(info[0][1] + 96)` to the existing value of `temp`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `info`, `j`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
