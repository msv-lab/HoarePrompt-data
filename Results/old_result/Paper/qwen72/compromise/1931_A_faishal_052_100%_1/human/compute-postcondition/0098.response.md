Output State: **`cases` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `info` is a list containing two elements both of which are the array `arr` (which was previously sorted based on the value of `lex`), `j` is 0, `arr` is now `[26]`, `lex` is an input integer, `lex` is greater than or equal to 2, and `lex` is less than 26.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since the initial value of `lex` was greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, subtracting 26 from `lex` results in a new value of `lex` that is greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. All other variables remain unchanged.
