Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `arr` is an empty list, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex < 28:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    elif lex <= 78:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 0, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1] and `lex` is reduced by 1, making `lex` less than 27. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26] and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` is [26] if `lex` is between 26 and 52 (inclusive) or remains an empty list if `lex` is greater than 52.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, and `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is [1], and `lex` is reduced by 1, making `lex` less than 27. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is [26], and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26. If `lex` is 52, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` 26. If `lex` is greater than 52 and less than or equal to 78, `arr` is [26], and `lex` is reduced by 26, making `lex` greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list, and `lex` is not modified.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, `j` is 1, and `arr` is [1], [26], or an empty list depending on the initial conditions. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is less than 26 or greater than 25 and less than or equal to 51 or 25 depending on the initial conditions, and `arr` is [1, 1], [26, 1], or [1] depending on the initial conditions. If `lex` is 28 or more, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 26 if it is less than 52, and `arr` is updated to [1, 26], [26, 26], or [26] depending on the initial conditions. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `lex` remains as it was initially, which is less than 27 or greater than 26 and less than or equal to 52 or 26 depending on the initial conditions.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
