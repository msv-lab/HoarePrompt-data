The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the next t lines contains an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. The function should output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded for each test case, each on a new line.
