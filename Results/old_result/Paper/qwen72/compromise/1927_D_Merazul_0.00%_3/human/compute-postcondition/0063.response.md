Output State: **`a` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces, `t` is now `t - 1` (but still greater than 0), `n` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are not in `a` but are in the new `b`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in the new `b`.**

The value of `f` is explicitly set to 1, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.
