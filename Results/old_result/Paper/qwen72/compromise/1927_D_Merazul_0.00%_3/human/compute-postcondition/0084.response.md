Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement.

### Initial State:
- `a` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`.
- `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces.
- `t` is now `t - 1` (but still greater than 0).
- `n` is 0 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in `b` but not in `a`, otherwise `n` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.
- `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `b` is a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`.
- `f` is 0 if any integer from 1 to `k` is not in `a` or `b`, otherwise `f` is 1.
- `m` is 0 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in `b` but not in `a`, otherwise `m` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.
- `i` is `k`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding the `f` variable:**
   - `f` is 0 if any integer from 1 to `k` is not in `a` or `b`.
   - `f` is 1 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in both `a` and `b`.

2. **Understanding the `n` variable:**
   - `n` is 0 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in `b` but not in `a`.
   - `n` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.

3. **Understanding the `m` variable:**
   - `m` is 0 if all integers from 1 to `k` are in `b` but not in `a`.
   - `m` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.

4. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression inside the `print` statement is `'YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2]`.
   - `f ^ 1` is the bitwise XOR operation between `f` and 1. This will flip the value of `f`:
     - If `f` is 0, `f ^ 1` is 1.
     - If `f` is 1, `f ^ 1` is 0.
   - `m | n < 0` is a logical OR operation:
     - `m` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`.
     - `n < 0` is a boolean expression that checks if `n` is less than 0. Since `n` is a count, it cannot be less than 0, so `n < 0` is always `False`.
     - Therefore, `m | n < 0` simplifies to `m | False`, which is just `m`.

5. **Combining the Expressions:**
   - The expression `f ^ 1 or m` will evaluate to:
     - `1 or m` if `f` is 0.
     - `0 or m` if `f` is 1.
   - Since `1 or m` is always `1` (because `1` is truthy), and `0 or m` is `m` (because `0` is falsy), the expression simplifies to:
     - `1` if `f` is 0.
     - `m` if `f` is 1.

6. **Slicing the String:**
   - The string `'YNEOS'` is being sliced based on the result of the expression `f ^ 1 or m`.
   - If the result is `1`, the slice is `'YNEOS'[1::2]`, which is `'NE'`.
   - If the result is `m`, the slice is `'YNEOS'[m::2]`.

7. **Final Output:**
   - If `f` is 0, the slice is `'NE'`.
   - If `f` is 1, the slice is `'YNEOS'[m::2]`.

### Conclusion:
- If `f` is 0 (i.e., any integer from 1 to `k` is not in `a` or `b`), the output will be `'NE'`.
- If `f` is 1 (i.e., all integers from 1 to `k` are in both `a` and `b`), the output will be `'Y'` if `m` is 0, and `'NE'` if `m` is 1 or greater.

Since `m` is the count of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, if `f` is 1, `m` must be 0 (because all integers from 1 to `k` are in both sets).

### Final Output:
Output: **'NE' (if any integer from 1 to k is not in a or b) or 'Y' (if all integers from 1 to k are in both a and b)**
