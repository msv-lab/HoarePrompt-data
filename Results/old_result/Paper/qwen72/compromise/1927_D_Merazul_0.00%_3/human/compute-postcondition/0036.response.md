Output State: **`a` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces, `t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 2, `n` is `k // 2` minus the number of integers `i` from 1 to `k` that are in the old `b` but not in the new `a`, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` is now a new set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is `k // 2` minus the number of integers `i` from 1 to `k` that are in the new `a` but not in the new `b`.** 

The variable `f` has been set to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
