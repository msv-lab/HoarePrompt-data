Output State: **`t` is an integer where 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 - 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a set of `n` unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `q` is an integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is the last integer in the input split by spaces, `b` is a set of integers generated by the function `R()`, `f` is 1, `m` is equal to `k // 2`, `n` is equal to `k // 2`.**

The code assigns the value of `k // 2` to both `m` and `n`. The value of `k // 2` is the integer division of `k` by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
