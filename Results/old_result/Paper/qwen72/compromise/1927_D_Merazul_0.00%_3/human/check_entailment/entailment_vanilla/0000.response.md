Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and `q` queries.
- Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n).
- For each query, we need to find two indices `i` and `j` such that:
  - l ≤ i ≤ r
  - l ≤ j ≤ r
  - a[i] ≠ a[j]
- If no such pair exists, we should output `-1 -1`.

### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (*_, k) = R()
        a = {*R()}
        b = {*R()}
        f = 1
        m = n = k // 2
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())` is a function to read a line of input and convert it to a list of integers.
   - `(t,) = R()` reads the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - `while t:` loops through each test case.
   - `t -= 1` decrements the test case counter.

3. **Reading Test Case Data:**
   - `(*_, k) = R()` reads the length of the array `k` (this should be `n` based on the problem description).
   - `a = {*R()}` reads the array `a` and converts it to a set.
   - `b = {*R()}` reads another set `b` (which is not used in the problem and seems out of place).

4. **Initialization:**
   - `f = 1` initializes a flag `f` to 1.
   - `m = n = k // 2` initializes two counters `m` and `n` to `k // 2`.

5. **Loop Through Elements:**
   - `for i in range(1, k + 1):` loops through each integer from 1 to `k`.
   - `u = i in a` checks if `i` is in the set `a`.
   - `v = i in b` checks if `i` is in the set `b` (which is not used and should be removed).
   - `f &= u | v` updates the flag `f` to be the logical AND of `f` and the logical OR of `u` and `v`.
   - `m -= u & ~v` and `n -= ~u & v` update the counters `m` and `n` based on the presence of `i` in `a` and `b`.

6. **Output:**
   - `print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])` prints a string based on the value of `f` and the counters `m` and `n`.

### Issues and Incorrectness:
1. **Set `b` is Unnecessary:**
   - The problem only requires working with the array `a` and the queries. The set `b` is not used in the problem and should not be part of the solution.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Pairs:**
   - The program uses a set `a` and performs operations on it, but it does not handle the queries correctly. The logic for finding pairs of indices `i` and `j` such that `a[i] ≠ a[j]` within the given range `[l, r]` is missing.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is incorrect. The program should output two indices `i` and `j` or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists, but it outputs a string based on some bitwise operations.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It has unnecessary elements, incorrect logic for handling queries, and an incorrect output format.

Correctness: **False**
