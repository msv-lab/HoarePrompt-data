Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, possibly related to set operations and conditions, but it does not address the task of finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within the given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```
The expected output should be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```
However, the provided program does not produce this output. The program uses set operations and variables that are not relevant to the problem statement, and it does not handle the queries as required. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
