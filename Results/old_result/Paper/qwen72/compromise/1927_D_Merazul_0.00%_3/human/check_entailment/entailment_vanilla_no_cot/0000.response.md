Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases, but it does not handle the inputs for each test case correctly. It reads the length of the array and the array itself, but it does not read the number of queries or the queries themselves.

2. **Logic for Queries**: The program does not contain any logic to process the queries. It only reads some values and performs bitwise operations, which are not relevant to the problem of finding pairs of indices with different elements in the specified range.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints 'YNEOS' based on some bitwise operations, which is not the correct output format for the problem. The problem requires outputting pairs of indices or -1 -1 if no such pair exists.

4. **Set Operations**: The program uses sets `a` and `b` to store the elements of the array, but it does not use these sets to find the required pairs of indices. Instead, it performs operations that are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the length of the array, the array itself, the number of queries, and the queries.
- For each query, find a pair of indices with different elements in the specified range or determine that no such pair exists.
- Print the results in the required format.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(R())
        q = int(input())
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = R()
            found = False
            for i in range(l-1, r):
                for j in range(i+1, r):
                    if a[i] != a[j]:
                        print(i+1, j+1)
                        found = True
                        break
                if found:
                    break
            if not found:
                print(-1, -1)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Reads the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array, the array itself, the number of queries, and the queries.
- For each query, it checks for a pair of indices with different elements in the specified range.
- Prints the results in the required format.
