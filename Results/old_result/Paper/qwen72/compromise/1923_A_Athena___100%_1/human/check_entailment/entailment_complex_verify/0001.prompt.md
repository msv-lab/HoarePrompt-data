You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = 0
        
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder that has been incremented `t` times, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is the last index of the last list `a` (if `a` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined), and `res` is the number of zeros in the last list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. For each test case, the function removes all leading and trailing free cells (0s) from the list and then counts the number of remaining free cells (0s) in the list. The function prints the count of free cells for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list `a` representing the ribbon.

2. **Trimming the Ribbon**:
   - The program trims the ribbon by removing leading and trailing zeros. This is done using two `while` loops:
     - The first loop removes leading zeros by popping elements from the start of the list `a` until a chip (1) is encountered.
     - The second loop removes trailing zeros by popping elements from the end of the list `a` until a chip (1) is encountered.
   - This step ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment of the ribbon that has chips and is bounded by chips.

3. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - After trimming, the program iterates through the remaining list `a` and counts the number of zeros (free cells) in this segment.
   - The number of zeros in this segment represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the count of free cells in the trimmed segment.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips and is bounded by chips.
  - The number of free cells in this segment is indeed the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.
  - The program handles all edge cases, such as when there are no free cells between the chips or when the chips are already in a single block.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the ribbon already contains a single block of chips (e.g., `1 1 1 1 1`), the program will correctly output `0` because there are no free cells to move.
  - If the ribbon has chips at the beginning and end with free cells in between (e.g., `0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0`), the program will correctly output the number of free cells between the chips.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
