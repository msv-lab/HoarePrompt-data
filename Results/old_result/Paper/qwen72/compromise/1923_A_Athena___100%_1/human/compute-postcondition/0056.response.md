The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

1. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. In a `for` loop, the loop variable (`i` in this case) is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.

2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed. The length of `a` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute one more time, as `i` is now 2.

3. **Variable `res`**: The variable `res` is not part of the loop head and thus should not be adjusted. Its value remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is 2, and `res` is 2 if the first element of `a` is 0 and the second element is 0. Otherwise, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0, and `res` remains 0 if the first element of `a` is not 0.**
