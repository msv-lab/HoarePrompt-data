Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last element of `a` has been removed, `res` is 0**

The last element of the list `a` (which was 0) has been removed, but the other elements remain unchanged. The conditions for `t`, `_`, `n`, and `res` remain as specified in the initial state.
