Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed.
2. `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
3. `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(res)
```

### Analysis:
- Since `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, the list `a` can still contain zeros, but only in the middle of the list.
- `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

### Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the number of zeros in the list `a`.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `res`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the count of zeros in the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros in the list `a`)**
