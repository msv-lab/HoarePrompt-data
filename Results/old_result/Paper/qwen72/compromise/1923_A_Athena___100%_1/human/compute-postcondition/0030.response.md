Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is a placeholder (its value is not relevant to the problem).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list where all leading zeros have been removed and all trailing zeros have been removed.
   - `i` is the last index of the list `a`.
   - `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The list `a` has all leading and trailing zeros removed. This means that any zeros that remain in the list `a` are internal zeros.
   - The variable `res` is defined as the number of zeros in the list `a`.
   - Since the list `a` has no leading or trailing zeros, `res` will be the count of internal zeros in the list.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the number of internal zeros in the list `a`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **res (where res is the number of internal zeros in the list `a`)**
