The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used within the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder**
