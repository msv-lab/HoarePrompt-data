Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is the last index of the list `a`, `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`, `_` is less than `t`, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on whitespace, converts each substring to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The initial state specifies that `a` was a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed. After the code execution, `a` is now a list of integers based on the user input.
- The variables `i`, `res`, `_`, and `n` are not affected by the code, so their states remain as specified in the initial state.
