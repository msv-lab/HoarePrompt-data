The code snippet `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Given the initial state, the last element of `a` is 0, and this element is removed. The new last element of `a` will now be the element that was originally at the second last index, which is `a[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1`, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user with all leading zeros removed and its last element removed, `i` is the new second last index of the updated list `a`, and `res` is 0.**
