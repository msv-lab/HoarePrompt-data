Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed.
   - `i` is the last index of the list `a` (if `a` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined).
   - `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.
   - `_` is less than `t`.
   - `n` is an input integer.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `res` is defined as the number of zeros in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` has all trailing zeros removed, any zeros in `a` must be non-trailing.
   - The exact number of zeros in `a` is not provided, but we know it is a non-negative integer.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the number of zeros in the list `a`.

Since the exact number of zeros in `a` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the given information.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros in the list `a`)**
