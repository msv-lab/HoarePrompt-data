Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed, `i` is the last index of the updated list `a` (if `a` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined), `res` is 0, `_` is less than `t`, `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have all its leading zeros removed. The variable `i` will be the last index of the updated list `a`, but if `a` becomes empty, `i` will be undefined. The variables `res`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial values.
