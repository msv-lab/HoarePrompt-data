Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder that has been incremented `t` times, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is the last index of the last list `a` (if `a` is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined), and `res` is the number of zeros in the last list `a`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of remaining test cases `t` is 0, meaning all test cases have been processed. The placeholder `_` has been incremented `t` times, but its value is not significant. The variable `n` holds the last input integer representing the number of cells in the ribbon for the last test case. The list `a` contains the state of the ribbon for the last test case, with all leading and trailing zeros removed. The variable `i` is the last index of the list `a` if it is not empty; otherwise, `i` is undefined. The variable `res` holds the number of zeros in the last processed list `a`.
