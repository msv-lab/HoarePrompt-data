The value of the last element in the list `a` is removed by the `pop()` method. Since the last element of `a` was 0, after `a.pop()`, the last element of `a` is now the second-to-last element before the operation. The index `i` was the last index of `a`, and since the last element has been removed, `i` is now the index of the new last element, which is `i - 1`. The other variables `res`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all leading zeros removed and the last element of `a` is the second-to-last element before the operation, `i` is `i - 1`, `res` is 0, `_` is less than `t`, `n` is an input integer.**
