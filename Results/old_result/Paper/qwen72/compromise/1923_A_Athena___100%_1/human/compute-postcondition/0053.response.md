The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed.
- `i` is 0.
- `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `a` must still have at least one element for the loop to continue, so `a` must have at least 1 element remaining.

State: **`a` is a non-empty list of integers with all leading and trailing zeros removed, `i` is 1, `res` is 1 if the first element of `a` is 0. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
