Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in a ribbon, and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. The function returns the state of the ribbon or an error message if the input is invalid. Each test case must have at least one cell with a chip.**
