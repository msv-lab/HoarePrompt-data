Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list where all leading zeros have been removed and the last element of `a` is no longer 0, `res` is 0**. 

The last element of the list `a` has been removed, so the last element of `a` is no longer 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
