You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of integers in the list, an integer `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6) determining the winning condition, and a list of `n` integers `a` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

            if x % 2 == 0:
                val_in = int(rev_val[x])
                rev_res += str(val_in)
            else:
                val_in = rev_val[x]
                rev_res += val_in[::-1]
        
        if 10 ** int(max_power) < int(rev_res):

            print('Anna')
        
    #State: `y` is `int(input()) - 1`, `int(input())` is the total number of test cases `t`, `list_len` is the first part of the input string for the last test case, `max_power` is the second part of the input string for the last test case, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string for the last test case, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing the reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, followed by the processed elements from `rev_val` according to the loop's rules. If the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than 10 raised to the power of `int(max_power)`, the output is 'Sasha'. Otherwise, the output is 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `m`, followed by a list of `n` integers. It reverses each integer in the list, concatenates those that have the same length as their original form, and sorts the reversed integers that have a different length. It then concatenates these sorted integers, alternating between their reversed and original forms. Finally, it compares the resulting concatenated integer to 10 raised to the power of `m` and prints 'Sasha' if the result is greater, otherwise it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the game logic correctly as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it does not simulate the turns of the players or the conditions under which Sasha wins. Instead, it attempts to concatenate and reverse the numbers in a way that does not follow the rules of the game.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output "Anna" because it does not correctly simulate the game. According to the problem, Anna can reverse the number 2 to 2, and then Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). Therefore, Sasha wins. However, the program does not follow this logic and instead concatenates the numbers in a way that does not reflect the game rules.
