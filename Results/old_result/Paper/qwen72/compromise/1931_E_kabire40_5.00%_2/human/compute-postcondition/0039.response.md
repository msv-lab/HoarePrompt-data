Output State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` must have at least three elements, `x` is 2, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[2]`**

The value of `val_in` is now the integer value of the third element in the `rev_val` list (since `x` is 2). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
