The only objects in the loop head are `x` and `operational_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `operational_list`. If `operational_list` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string. For the loop to execute, `operational_list` must have at least one element.

State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string and must have at least one element, `rev_val` is an empty list, and `rev_res` is an empty string.**
