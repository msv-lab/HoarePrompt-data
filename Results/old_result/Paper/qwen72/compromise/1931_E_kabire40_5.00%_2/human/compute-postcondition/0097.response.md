Postcondition: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing all reversed strings of elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, plus the concatenation of the even-indexed elements of `rev_val` in their integer form and the odd-indexed elements of `rev_val` in their reversed string form. Additionally, `10 ** int(max_power)` is greater than or equal to `int(rev_res)`.**
