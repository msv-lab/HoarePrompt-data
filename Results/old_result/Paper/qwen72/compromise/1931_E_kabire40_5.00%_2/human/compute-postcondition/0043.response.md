Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` must have at least three elements, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `val_in` is the integer value of `rev_val[2]`, and `rev_res` is updated to include the original value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`. If `x` is not even, `val_in` is the third element of `rev_val` (index 2), and `rev_res` is updated by appending the reversed `val_in`.***
