Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, and `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `y` remains 1.
- The condition `int(input())` must still be greater than 1.
- `list_len` and `max_power` remain unchanged as they are derived from the input string.
- `operational_list` is the list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
- `rev_val` will contain the reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` where the reversed integer value has a different length than the original string.
- `rev_res` will be the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` where the reversed integer value has the same length as the original string.
