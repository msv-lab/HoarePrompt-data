Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_res` is a string containing all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has the same length as the original string. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is updated to include the string representation of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the integer value of the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is updated to include the reversed string of `val_in`, where `val_in` is the element at index `x` in `rev_val`. In both cases, `rev_val` remains a sorted list containing the reversed strings of all elements from `operational_list` whose reversed integer form has a different length than the original string, and `rev_val` must have at least one element.***
