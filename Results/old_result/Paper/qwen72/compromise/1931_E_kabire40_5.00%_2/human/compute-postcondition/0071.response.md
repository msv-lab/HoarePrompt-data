Postcondition: ***`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` has at least three string elements, `x` is the third element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the concatenation of `rev_res` and `x`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x`.***
