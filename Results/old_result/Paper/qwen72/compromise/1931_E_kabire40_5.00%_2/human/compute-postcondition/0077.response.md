Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing at least one reversed string of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `rev_res` is a string containing the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have the same length as the original string, and `x` is an even integer. `val_in` is the integer value of the string at index `x` in `rev_val`. `rev_res` is now the original `rev_res` concatenated with the string representation of `val_in`.**
