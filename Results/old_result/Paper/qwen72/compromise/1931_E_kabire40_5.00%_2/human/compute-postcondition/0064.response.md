Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` must have at least two string elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list`, `rev_res` is the second element of `operational_list` concatenated with itself, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the second element of `operational_list` if the length condition is not met, otherwise `rev_val` is not affected, and `rev_res` is the second element of `operational_list` concatenated with itself if the length condition is met.**
