Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, and `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code `operational_list = input().split()` reassigns `operational_list` to a new list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
- The previous value of `operational_list` is no longer valid and is replaced by the new list.
- The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `rev_val`, and `rev_res` remain unchanged.
