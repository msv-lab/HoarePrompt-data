Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is an empty list, `rev_res` is an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `rev_res = ''` reassigns the variable `rev_res` to an empty string.
- The initial state specified that `rev_res` was a string containing elements from `operational_list` and `rev_val`. After the code execution, `rev_res` is now an empty string.
- All other variables (`y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, `rev_val`) remain unchanged and retain their initial state values.
