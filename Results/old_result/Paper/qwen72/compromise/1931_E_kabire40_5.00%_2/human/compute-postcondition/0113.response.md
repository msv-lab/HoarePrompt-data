Output State: **`y` is 2, `int(input())` is greater than 2, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the new input string and must have at least two elements, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is set to the string `x` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `x_rev = int(x[::-1])` reverses the string `x` and converts it to an integer, assigning the result to `x_rev`.
- The values of `y`, `int(input())`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `rev_res` and `rev_val` remain the same as specified in the initial state, as the code snippet does not affect these variables directly.
