Postcondition: ***`y` is 1, `int(input())` must be greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` must have at least one string element, `x` is the first element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the first element of `operational_list`. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of the first element of `operational_list`, and `rev_res` is an empty string.***
