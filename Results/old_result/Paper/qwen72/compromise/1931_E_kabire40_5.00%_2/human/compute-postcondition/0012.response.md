The only object in the loop head is the variable `x` and the list `operational_list`. The loop will execute for each element in `operational_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the first element of `operational_list`, and `operational_list` must have at least one element for the loop to have executed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `operational_list` must have at least two elements. The next iteration will set `x` to the second element of `operational_list`.

State: **`y` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `list_len` is a string, `max_power` is a string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string and must have at least two elements, `x` is the second element of `operational_list`, `x_rev` is the integer value of the reversed string of `x`. If the length of the string representation of `x_rev` is equal to the length of `x`, `rev_res` is the string `x` and `rev_val` remains an empty list. Otherwise, `rev_val` is a list containing the reversed string of `x` and `rev_res` remains an empty string.**
