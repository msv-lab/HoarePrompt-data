Output State: **`y` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1, `list_len` is the first part of the input string, `max_power` is the second part of the input string, `operational_list` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `rev_val` is a sorted list containing at least 2 reversed strings of all elements in `operational_list` whose reversed integer values have a different length than the original string, `x` is 2, `val_in` is the integer value of the third element in `rev_val`, `rev_res` is the original value of `rev_res` plus the string representation of `val_in`.**
