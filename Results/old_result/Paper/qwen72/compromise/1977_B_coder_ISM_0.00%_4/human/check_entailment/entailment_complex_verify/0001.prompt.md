You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Output

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: The variable `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30, and `t` is an input integer. The list `s` contains the binary representation of `x` with possible modifications due to the loop logic, and `length` is the length of the list `s` after all iterations. The modifications to `s` include converting pairs of consecutive '1's to '-1' and '0', and potentially appending an additional '1' to the list if the last bit was modified.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30) and converts it to a binary string representation. It then modifies this binary string by converting pairs of consecutive '1's to '-1' and '0', and potentially appends an additional '1' to the string if the last bit was modified. The function prints the modified binary string, the length of the modified string, and the modified string again for each test case. The final state of the program includes the modified binary string and its length for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The function initializes an array `s` of length 30 with binary digits of `x`. This is done by checking each bit of `x` using bitwise AND (`x & pow(2, i)`), and appending '1' if the bit is set, otherwise appending '0'.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints:**
   - The function then iterates over the array `s` to adjust the values to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist.
   - It uses a flag to keep track of whether a carry-over adjustment is needed.
   - If a '1' is followed by another '1', the first '1' is changed to '-1', and the flag is set to 1, indicating a carry-over.
   - If the flag is set and the next bit is '0', the '0' is changed to '1', and the flag is reset to 0.
   - If the flag is set and the next bit is also '1', the current bit is set to '0', and the flag remains 1.
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set, it adjusts the last bit or appends a new bit to handle the carry-over.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The function makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist by checking if a '-1' is followed by a '1'. If so, it changes the '-1' to '0' and the '1' to '-1'.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the length of the array `s` and the array itself.

### Analysis:
- **Binary Representation:**
  - The initial binary representation is correct, but it is stored as a list of strings, which is not ideal for arithmetic operations. However, this does not affect the correctness of the logic.
  
- **Adjusting for Constraints:**
  - The logic for adjusting the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero values is mostly correct, but it has a few issues:
    - The flag is used to handle carry-overs, but the logic for handling the carry-over at the end of the array is not entirely clear.
    - The final adjustment loop is necessary but could be more straightforward.

- **Output:**
  - The output format is correct, but the length of the array should be recalculated after the adjustments, as the array might have been modified.

### Issues:
- **Carry-Over Handling:**
  - The carry-over handling at the end of the array is not robust. If the last bit is '0' and the flag is set, it changes the last bit to '1', which might not be correct if the array needs to be extended.
  - If the flag is set and the last bit is '1', it changes the last bit to '0' and appends a '1', which might not always be the correct adjustment.

- **Final Adjustments:**
  - The final adjustment loop is necessary but could be simplified. The condition `if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1')` should be handled more carefully to avoid unnecessary changes.

### Conclusion:
The program is **not** entirely correct due to the issues in the carry-over handling and the final adjustments. The logic is close but needs refinement to handle edge cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**
