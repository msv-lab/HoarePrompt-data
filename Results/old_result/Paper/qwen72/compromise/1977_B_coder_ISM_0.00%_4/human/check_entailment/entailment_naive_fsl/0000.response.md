Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the conversion of the integer `x` into the array `a` with the specified constraints. Specifically, the logic for converting the binary representation of `x` into the array `a` with elements 1, 0, or -1, and ensuring no two consecutive non-zero elements, is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
14
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5
0 -1 0 0 1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
30
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0
```

The program prints an array of length 30, which is not within the allowed range of 1 to 32, and the array does not correctly represent the number 14 in the specified format. The program also does not correctly handle the conversion and the constraints for the array elements.
