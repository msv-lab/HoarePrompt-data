The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) and converts it to a binary string representation. It then modifies this binary string by converting pairs of consecutive '1's to '-1' and '0', and potentially appends an additional '1' to the string if the last bit was modified. The function prints the modified binary string, the length of the modified string, and the modified string again for each test case. The final state of the program includes the modified binary string and its length for each test case.
