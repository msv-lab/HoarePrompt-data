The loop condition is `l < h`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h`.

From the given state:
- `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`
- `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`
- `mid` is equal to `l`
- If `mid_sum - left < right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is one index greater than `l`.
- Otherwise, `l` and `h` remain converged to the same index in `D`, but `h` is one index greater than `l`.

Given the condition `l < h`, if `l` and `h` remain converged to the same index in `D`, the loop will not execute again because `l` would be equal to `h`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is one index greater than `l`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `l` is updated to `mid + 1` and `h` is one index greater than `l`.

State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `h` is one index greater than `l`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged.**
