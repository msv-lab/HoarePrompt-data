To ensure that the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to focus on the condition `l < h`. The variables `l` and `h` are the only ones that can be adjusted to meet this condition.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`
- `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`

For the loop to execute at least once, `l` must be less than `h`. This means that `l` should be an index that is less than the index `h`.

Let's consider the possible adjustments:
- If `l` is already less than `h`, no adjustment is needed.
- If `l` is not less than `h`, we need to ensure that `l` is set to a value that is less than `h`.

Since we don't have specific values for `l` and `h`, we need to ensure that the condition `l < h` is met. Therefore, we can state that `l` must be less than `h` for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` and `l` must be less than `h`, `h` is the index of the largest element in `D` that is less than `right - f`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right` remain unchanged.**
