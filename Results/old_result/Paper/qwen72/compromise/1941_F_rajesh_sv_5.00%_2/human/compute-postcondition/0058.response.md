Postcondition: **The loop has finished executing, and the variables `l` and `h` have converged to the same index in `D`. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**
