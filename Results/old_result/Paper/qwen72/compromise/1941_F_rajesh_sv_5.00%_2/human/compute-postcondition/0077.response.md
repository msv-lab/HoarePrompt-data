Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `h` is one index greater than `l`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `mid` is updated to `l + (h - l) // 2`, which calculates the midpoint between `l` and `h`.
- `l` is already updated to `mid + 1` in the initial state, so this remains unchanged.
- `h` is still one index greater than `l`.
- `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remain unchanged because they are based on the previous value of `mid`, which is now updated.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f`) remain unchanged.
