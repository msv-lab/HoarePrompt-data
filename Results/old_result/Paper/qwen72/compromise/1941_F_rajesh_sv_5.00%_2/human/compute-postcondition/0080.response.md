Output State: **`mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`, `l` is updated to `mid + 1`, `h` is updated to `mid`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `f` remain unchanged.**

The value of `h` is updated to `mid`, while all other variables retain their previous values. The initial state for `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` remains valid, and `l` is still updated to `mid + 1`.
