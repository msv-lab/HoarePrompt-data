Postcondition: ***`l` is equal to `h`, and both `l` and `h` are the index of the element in `D` that is closest to the midpoint between `left - f` and `right - f`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`) remain unchanged. If `l` is equal to `h`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`.***
