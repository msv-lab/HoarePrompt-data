Output State: **The loop processes t test cases, where for each test case, it prints pairs of integers from the list `a` that appear twice in the first half of the list until k pairs are printed. If fewer than k pairs are found, it prints additional integers from the first half of the list that appear only once until 2k integers are printed. It then prints the remaining integers from the first half of the list that were not printed in the previous steps. Finally, it prints pairs of integers from the second half of the list that appear twice until the number of printed integers from the first half matches the number of printed integers from the second half.**

In more detail:
- `t` remains the same as the initial value.
- For each test case:
  - `n` and `k` are read from input and remain the same as the values provided.
  - `a` is read from input and remains the same as the values provided.
  - `l` and `r` are lists of size `n` that count the occurrences of each integer in the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
  - `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are counters that track the number of integers printed from the first and second halves of `a`.
  - `res` is a list that stores the integers printed from the first half of `a` that appear only once.
  - The loop prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` that appear twice until `k` pairs are printed.
  - If fewer than `k` pairs are found, it prints additional integers from the first half of `a` that appear only once until `2k` integers are printed.
  - It then prints the remaining integers from the first half of `a` that were not printed in the previous steps.
  - Finally, it prints pairs of integers from the second half of `a` that appear twice until the number of printed integers from the first half matches the number of printed integers from the second half.
