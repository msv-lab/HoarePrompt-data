Reasoning:

The program as provided does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The program reads the number of test cases (`kreker`) but does not properly handle them. The function `func_1` is called in a loop, but it does not take any parameters, and it reads input independently each time it is called. This means that the input for each test case is read correctly, but the function does not know how many test cases there are, and it will continue to read input until it encounters an error or the input stream ends.

2. **Logic for Determining the Result**: The function `func_1` checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. However, this logic is incorrect. The correct logic should be to check if the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the number of moves required to reach exactly `m` cubes from 0 cubes must be even if `m` is to be reached exactly after `n` moves.

3. **Input and Output Handling**: The function reads input correctly for each test case, but it does not handle the output in a way that would be consistent with the problem's requirements for multiple test cases.

To fix the program, we need to:

- Pass the number of test cases to the loop.
- Correct the logic inside `func_1` to check if `n - m` is even.
- Ensure the function handles the input and output correctly for each test case.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This version correctly handles multiple test cases and uses the correct logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

Correctness: **False**
