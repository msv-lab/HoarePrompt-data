You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 100. It then compares `n` and `m`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints 'Yes'. If `n` is less than `m`, it prints 'No'. The function does not handle multiple test cases or accept any parameters; it only processes a single input of two integers and prints the result of the comparison.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The condition `if n >= m:` only checks if the number of moves is greater than or equal to the target number of cubes, but it does not consider whether the number of moves can actually result in a tower with exactly `m` cubes.

For example, consider the test case where `n = 2` and `m = 4`. According to the problem, it is impossible to end up with a tower of 4 cubes after exactly 2 moves, because each move can only add or remove one cube. However, the program will incorrectly output "Yes" for this case.

Another example is the test case where `n = 5` and `m = 3`. The program will output "Yes" because `n >= m`, but the correct output should be "Yes" only if `n` is odd and `m` is less than or equal to `n`, or if `n` is even and `m` is less than or equal to `n` and `m` is even.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n` is odd, `m` can be any value from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- If `n` is even, `m` can be any even value from 2 to `n` (inclusive).

The provided program does not account for these conditions, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
