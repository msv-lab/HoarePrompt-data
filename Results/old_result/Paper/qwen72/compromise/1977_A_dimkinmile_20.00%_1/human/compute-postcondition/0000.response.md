Output State: **The function should take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. `n` and `m` are now specific non-negative integers provided by the input, and the input is split into two integers.**
