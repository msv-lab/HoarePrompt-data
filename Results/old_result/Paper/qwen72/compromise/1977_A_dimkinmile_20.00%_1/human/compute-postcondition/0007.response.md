Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where 1 <= n, m <= 100. It then compares `n` and `m`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints 'Yes'. If `n` is less than `m`, it prints 'No'. The function does not handle multiple test cases or accept any parameters; it only processes a single input of two integers and prints the result of the comparison. **
