#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described. A correct function definition would be:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in the `monsters` list that were processed before the loop broke or finished, `can_survive` is True if the total bullets used (`bullets_used`) is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the position (`distance`) and `k` for all tuples in the `monsters` list, otherwise `can_survive` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from user input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `x`. It then processes these inputs to determine if it is possible to survive by checking if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters (sum of health values in `a`) is less than or equal to the product of the maximum distance (absolute value of positions in `x`) and `k`. The function prints 'YES' if it is possible to survive and 'NO' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function ends.
