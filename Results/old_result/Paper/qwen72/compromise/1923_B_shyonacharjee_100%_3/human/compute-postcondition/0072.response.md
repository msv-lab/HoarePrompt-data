Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a` and must have at least 1 tuple, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, `total_bullets_needed` is equal to `bullets_used` + `health`.**

Explanation: The variable `total_bullets_needed` is assigned the value of `bullets_used` plus `health`. Since `bullets_used` is 0, `total_bullets_needed` is now equal to `health`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
