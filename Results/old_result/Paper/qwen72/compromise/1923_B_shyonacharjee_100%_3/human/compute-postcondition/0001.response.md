The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since `t` is an integer input by the user, for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is a placeholder that will start from 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
