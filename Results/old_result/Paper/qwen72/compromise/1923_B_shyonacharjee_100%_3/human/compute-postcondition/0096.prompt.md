You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters to handle the input as described. A correct function definition would be:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `_` is `t-1`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element from the pairs formed by zipping `x` and `a`, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in the `monsters` list that were processed before the loop broke or finished, `can_survive` is True if the total bullets used (`bullets_used`) is less than or equal to the product of the absolute value of the position (`distance`) and `k` for all tuples in the `monsters` list, otherwise `can_survive` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters and its return value is not specified.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
