Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that were already present in `freq` before the current iteration for all elements in `arr`.**
