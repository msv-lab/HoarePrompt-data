The code reads input from `stdin` and splits it into lines, storing the result in the variable `data`. Since `data` is now a list of lines from the input, and none of the variables in the function signature are used, the output state will reflect this change.

Output State: **The function now reads input from `stdin` using `sys.stdin.read`. None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function is prepared to process the input to create a list of test cases. `data` is a list of lines from the input.**
