Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` found in `freq` during the loop, where `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y` for each element `a` in `arr`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `results.append(count)` appends the current value of `count` to the list `results`.
- The initial state specifies that `results` already contains the value `count` and the new `count` value that was appended.
- After the execution of the code, `results` will contain the original `count` value and the new `count` value, plus the additional `count` value that was appended.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `freq` remain unchanged.
- The value of `count` is not explicitly changed by the code snippet, but the list `results` now includes the current value of `count` as its last element.
