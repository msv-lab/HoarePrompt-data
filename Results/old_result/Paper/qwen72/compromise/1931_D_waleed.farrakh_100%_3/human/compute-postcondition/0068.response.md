Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`, `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`. If `current_pair` is in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1, and `count` is incremented by the value of `freq[rx, ry]`. If `current_pair` is not in `freq`, `freq[current_pair]` is set to 1, and `count` remains unchanged.***
