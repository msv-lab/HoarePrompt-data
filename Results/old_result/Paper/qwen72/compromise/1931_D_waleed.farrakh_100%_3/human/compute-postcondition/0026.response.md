The only objects in the loop head are the variables `result` and the list `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `result` was the second element in the list, and the `results` list contained at least two elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least three elements. The next iteration will set `result` to the third element in the list.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing at least three elements, `result` is the third element in the list**
