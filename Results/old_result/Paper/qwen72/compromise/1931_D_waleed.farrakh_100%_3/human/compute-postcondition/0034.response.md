Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is an empty list, `freq` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for all elements `a` in `arr`, `count` is the total number of pairs `(rx, ry)` that were already present in `freq` before the current iteration for all elements in `arr`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `test_cases` remains a list of tuples with at least one tuple.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their initial values as the first, second, and third elements of the first tuple in `test_cases`.
- `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple in `test_cases` and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop has completed.
- `results` remains an empty list, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `freq` is a dictionary that now contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair for every element `a` in `arr`.
- `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` was already present in `freq` before the current iteration for all elements in `arr`. This means `count` reflects the number of pairs that were encountered more than once during the loop's execution.
