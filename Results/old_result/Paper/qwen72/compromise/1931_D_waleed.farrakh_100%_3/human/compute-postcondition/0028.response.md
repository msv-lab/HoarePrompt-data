Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`, `results` is a list containing all the elements that were returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, and the loop has printed each element in `results` exactly once.**

In natural language, this means that after all iterations of the loop have completed, the variable `t` must still be greater than 0, indicating that there were test cases to process. The `test_cases` list must contain at least one tuple, and the `results` list will contain all the elements that were returned by the function `func_1(test_cases)`. Each element in the `results` list will have been printed exactly once by the loop.
