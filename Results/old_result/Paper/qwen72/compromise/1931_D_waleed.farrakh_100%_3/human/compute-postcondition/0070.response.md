Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary that contains the frequency of each `(a % x, a % y)` pair from the elements of `arr`, `count` is the sum of the frequencies of all pairs `(a % x, a % y)` that were encountered before the current element in the loop.**
