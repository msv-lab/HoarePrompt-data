Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least three tuples, `n` is the first element of the third tuple, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, `y` is the third element of the third tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the third tuple and must have at least three elements, `results` is a list containing the values `count` and the new `count` value that was appended, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element of `arr`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, `rx` is the result of the expression `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of the expression `a % y`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is updated to `count + freq[rx, ry]`. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- `current_pair` is assigned the value `(a % x, a % y)`, where `a` is the third element of `arr`, `x` is the second element of the third tuple, and `y` is the third element of the third tuple.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `results`, `freq`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `count` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `current_pair` is added to the output state.
