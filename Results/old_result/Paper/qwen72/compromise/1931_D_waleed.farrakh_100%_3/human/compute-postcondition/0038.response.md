Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least two tuples, `n` is the first element of the second tuple, `x` is the second element of the second tuple, `y` is the third element of the second tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the second tuple and must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `results` is a list containing the value `count`, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `count = 0` resets the value of `count` to 0. All other variables and their initial states remain unchanged.
