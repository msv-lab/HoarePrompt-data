Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct for solving the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - For each element `a` in the array, it calculates `rx` and `ry` which are the remainders when `-a` is divided by `x` and `a` is divided by `y`, respectively.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the count of that pair to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to create a list of test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the following line.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct and matches the problem's input format. Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.
