Reasoning:  
The program reads a number `t` which is supposed to represent the number of test cases, but it always reads exactly 10 pairs of integers, regardless of the value of `t`. This means that if `t` is less than 10, the program will still read 10 pairs, and if `t` is greater than 10, it will only read the first 10 pairs and ignore the rest. This behavior does not match the problem description, which specifies that the number of test cases should be determined by `t`.

Additionally, the program does not handle the input `t` in any way, and it always processes exactly 10 test cases. This is a clear deviation from the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
