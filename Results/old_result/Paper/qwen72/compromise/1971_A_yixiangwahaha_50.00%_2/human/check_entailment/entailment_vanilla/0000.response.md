### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `input()`.
   - However, the program does not use `t` to determine the number of test cases. Instead, it always reads 10 test cases using a fixed loop `for i in range(10)`.

2. **Test Case Collection**:
   - The program collects the test cases in two lists `x` and `y` by reading input and splitting it into two integers.
   - This part of the program is correct and will store the values as expected.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - The program then iterates over the collected test cases and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair.
   - The logic for determining the minimum and maximum is correct: if `x[i] < y[i]`, it prints `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`; otherwise, it prints `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` and `y` are equal by printing the same number twice, which is correct.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` or `y` is 0, which is within the valid input range.

5. **Input Constraints**:
   - The problem specifies that the number of test cases `t` can be between 1 and 100, but the program always reads 10 test cases regardless of the value of `t`.
   - This is a significant issue because the program will not work correctly if `t` is not 10. For example, if `t` is 5, the program will still read 10 test cases, which can lead to extra input being read or the program waiting for more input than provided.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the number of test cases `t` as specified in the problem description. It always reads 10 test cases, which can lead to incorrect behavior if `t` is not 10.

Correctness: **False**
