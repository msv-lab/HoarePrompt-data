You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each iteration, x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 9.
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
        
    #State: `t` is a string input, `x` is a list containing 10 integers, `y` is a list containing 10 integers.
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The loop prints pairs of integers from the lists `x` and `y` for each index `i` from 0 to 9. If `x[i]` is less than `y[i]`, it prints `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, it prints `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which is expected to be a non-negative integer between 1 and 100. The function then reads 10 pairs of non-negative integers (each between 0 and 9) and stores them in two lists, `x` and `y`. After collecting the inputs, the function iterates through these lists and prints each pair of integers in ascending order. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the lists `x` and `y` contain 10 integers each, and the input `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), which represents the number of test cases. However, the program hard-codes the number of test cases to 10, which will cause it to fail if `t` is not 10. For example, if `t` is 5, the program will still attempt to read 10 lines of input, leading to an error when it tries to read more lines than are provided. Additionally, the program does not validate the input to ensure that `t` is within the specified range, which is a potential edge case that is not handled.
