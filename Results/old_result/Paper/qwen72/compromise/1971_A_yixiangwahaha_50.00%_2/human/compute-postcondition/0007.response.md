Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 100. For each iteration, the function expects two non-negative integers `x` and `y`, each between 0 and 9, to be provided. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not defined in the given constraints.**
