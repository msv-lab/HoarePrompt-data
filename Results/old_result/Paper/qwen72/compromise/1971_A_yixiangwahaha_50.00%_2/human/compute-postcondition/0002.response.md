The code snippet `y = []` reassigns the variable `y` to an empty list. The initial state specified that `y` was a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 9. After the execution, `y` is no longer an integer but an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a string input, `x` is an empty list, `y` is an empty list, and the function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100.**
