The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. At the start of the next iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 2, `s` is an input string, `s1` is the number of '1' characters in `s`, `t1` is the number of '1' characters in `t`, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if `s[1]` is different from `t[1]`, otherwise `cnt` remains 0, `i` is 2**
