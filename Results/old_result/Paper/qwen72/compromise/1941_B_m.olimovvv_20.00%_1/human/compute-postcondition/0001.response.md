Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times. For each iteration, it reads an integer `a` and a list of `n` integers `b`. If the first element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second element minus 2, or if the last element of `b` is odd and not equal to the second-to-last element minus 2, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are unchanged after the loop, and the list `a` remains the same as it was before the loop started.**
