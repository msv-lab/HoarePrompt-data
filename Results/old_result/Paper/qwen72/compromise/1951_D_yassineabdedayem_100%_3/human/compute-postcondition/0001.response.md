The only variables in the loop head are the loop variable `_` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The value of `t` is updated to the integer input provided by the user, which is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1. The loop variable `_` is not something we need to adjust explicitly, as it is managed by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
