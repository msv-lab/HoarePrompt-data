The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but the function signature does not include any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here is the step-by-step thinking:

1. **Parameters**:
   - `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This likely represents the number of test cases.
   - `n`: A positive integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. This could represent a value or a count in each test case.
   - `k`: A positive integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. This could represent another value or a count in each test case.

2. **Return Value**:
   - The output description is missing, but typically, a function with these constraints would return a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are positive integers. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
