Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the program continues without modifying `possible`. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
