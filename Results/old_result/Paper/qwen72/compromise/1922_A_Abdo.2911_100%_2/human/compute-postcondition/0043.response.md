The code snippet provided contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The initial state describes several variables and their conditions, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string literal `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
