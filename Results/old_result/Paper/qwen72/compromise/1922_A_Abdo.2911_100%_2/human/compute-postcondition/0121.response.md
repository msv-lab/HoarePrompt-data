Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a new string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, and `i` is 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `possible`.***
