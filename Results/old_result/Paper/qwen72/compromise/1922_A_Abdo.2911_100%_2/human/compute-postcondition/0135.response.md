Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters). The function then checks if there is any index `i` in the range [0, n-1] where either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such an index exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state of the program includes the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` as described in the annotations, but the primary effect is the output of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. **
