The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `t` and the current value of `_`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be 2 and `t` must still be an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is True if at any point during the loop, `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, or if `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is False.**
