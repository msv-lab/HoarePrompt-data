The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string 'YES' regardless of the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, or `possible`.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be:

Output: **YES**
