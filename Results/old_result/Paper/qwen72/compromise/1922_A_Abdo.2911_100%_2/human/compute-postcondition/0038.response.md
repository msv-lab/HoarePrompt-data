Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i`. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `possible` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
