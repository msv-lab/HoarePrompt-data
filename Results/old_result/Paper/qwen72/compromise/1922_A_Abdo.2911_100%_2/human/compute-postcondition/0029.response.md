Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a string input by the user, `b` is a string input by the user, `c` is a string input by the user with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`. If `a[i]` equals `b[i]` and `c[i]` matches either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop continues to the next iteration. If `a[i]` does not equal `b[i]` or `c[i]` does not match either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, `possible` is set to True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
