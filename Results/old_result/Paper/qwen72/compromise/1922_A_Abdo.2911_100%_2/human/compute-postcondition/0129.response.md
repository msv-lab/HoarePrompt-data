The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The precondition describes the state of the program before this statement is executed, but it does not directly influence the output of the `print` statement itself. The precondition indicates that the variable `possible` is set to `True` based on certain conditions involving the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, and the integer `i` which is `n - 1`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on these variables or conditions; it simply prints the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
