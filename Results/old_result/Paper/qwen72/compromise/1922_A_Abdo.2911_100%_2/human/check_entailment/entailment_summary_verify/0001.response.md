### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a variable `possible` to `False` to track whether a valid template exists.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
       - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). For `c` to not match, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). This is correctly handled by the condition `if c[i] != a[i]`.
     - **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
       - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be an uppercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. For `c` to not match, `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is correctly handled by the condition `elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]`.
     - **Case 3: `c[i]` matches neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`**
       - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then a valid template can be constructed, and `possible` is set to `True`.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES" indicating that a valid template exists.
   - If `possible` is `False`, the function prints "NO" indicating that no valid template exists.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - The condition `if a[i] == b[i]` correctly identifies positions where `a` and `b` are the same.
  - The condition `if c[i] != a[i]` ensures that `c` does not match the template at these positions, which is correct.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - The condition `elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]` correctly identifies positions where `c` matches either `a` or `b`.
  - The `continue` statement ensures that the function continues to the next position if `c` matches either `a` or `b`, which is correct because `c` might still match the template at other positions.
  - The condition `else` ensures that if `c` does not match either `a` or `b`, a valid template can be constructed, and `possible` is set to `True`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles all edge cases correctly, including when `a`, `b`, and `c` are of length 1, and when `a` and `b` are identical or different.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
