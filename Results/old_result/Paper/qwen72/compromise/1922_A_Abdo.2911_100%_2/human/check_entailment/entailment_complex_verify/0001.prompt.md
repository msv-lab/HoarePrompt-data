You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()

                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `b` is the last input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `c` is the last input string with leading and trailing whitespace removed, `i` is `n - 1`, and `possible` is True if at any point during the last iteration of the loop, either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. Otherwise, `possible` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n` and consisting of lowercase Latin letters). The function then checks if there is any index `i` in the range [0, n-1] where either `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, or `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such an index exists, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the final state of the program includes the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `possible` as described in the annotations, but the primary effect is the output of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a variable `possible` to `False` to track whether a valid template exists.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` must be an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]` since they are the same). The function checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). If it is, then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the template at position `i` can be either an uppercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`. The function checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If it is, then `c` does not match the template, and `possible` is set to `True`.
     - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]` when `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the function continues to the next position because `c` might still match the template at other positions.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES" indicating that a valid template exists.
   - If `possible` is `False`, the function prints "NO" indicating that no valid template exists.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be an uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). For `c` to not match, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`). This is correctly handled by the condition `if c[i] != a[i]`.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be an uppercase version of either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. For `c` to not match, `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is correctly handled by the condition `elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]`.

- **Case 3: `c[i]` matches neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]`**
  - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then a valid template can be constructed, and `possible` is set to `True`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
