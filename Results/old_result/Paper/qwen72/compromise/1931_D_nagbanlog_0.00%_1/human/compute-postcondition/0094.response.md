Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is 0, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code sets `beautiful_count` to 0.
- This affects the `results` list, where the second element was previously `beautiful_count` and is now also 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`) remain unchanged.
