Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing at least three tuples, `case` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing three elements where the first element is 0, the second element is 0, and the third element is `beautiful_count`, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is a non-empty list, `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple `(mod_x, mod_y)` and its value is the count of how many times the corresponding `mod_x` and `mod_y` occurred in the list `a`, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that the sum of their required modifications to `x` and `y` results in a pair that exists in `freq`. The variables `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` will hold the values corresponding to the last element processed in the list `a`.**
