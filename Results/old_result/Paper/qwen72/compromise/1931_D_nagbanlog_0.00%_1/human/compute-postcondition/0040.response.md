Output State: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `a` must have at least one more element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0, `beautiful_count` is increased by `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`.**
