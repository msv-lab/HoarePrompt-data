Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is still a list of tuples containing at least two tuples, `case` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is now a list containing one element which is the value of `beautiful_count`, `n` is the first value from `case['params']`, `x` is the second value from `case['params']`, `y` is the third value from `case['params']`, `a` is the array from `case['array']` and has been fully iterated over, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is the total count of numbers in `a` that can be transformed into a "beautiful" number by adding a non-negative integer less than `x` such that the resulting number is divisible by `x` and has the same remainder when divided by `y` as the original number.**
