The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements:
  - `n`: an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the list `a`.
  - `x` and `y`: integers (1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9).
  - `a`: a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements. Each element in `results` corresponds to a test case and represents the `beautiful_count` for that test case. The `beautiful_count` is the total count of "beautiful" pairs found in the list `a` for that test case. A "beautiful" pair is defined as a pair of elements `(a[i], a[j])` such that `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n`, two integers `x` and `y`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of "beautiful" pairs in the corresponding list `a`. A "beautiful" pair `(a[i], a[j])` is defined as a pair where `i < j` and both `a[i] + x` is divisible by `x` and `a[i] + y` is divisible by `y`.**
