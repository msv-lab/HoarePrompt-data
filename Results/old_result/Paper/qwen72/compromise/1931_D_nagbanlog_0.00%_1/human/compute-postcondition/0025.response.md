To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the values of the variables involved:

1. **`num`**: This is the original number.
2. **`mod_x`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
3. **`mod_y`**: This is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
4. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
5. **`required_mod_y`**: This is the same as `mod_y`.

Given these definitions, let's analyze the values:

- **`num`**: The original number, which remains unchanged.
- **`mod_x`**: The remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.
- **`mod_y`**: The remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.
- **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This formula ensures that `required_mod_x` is the smallest non-negative integer such that adding it to `mod_x` results in a multiple of `x`.
- **`required_mod_y`**: This is simply the value of `mod_y`.

Now, let's put this into the `print` statement:

```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

The output will be:

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [required_mod_x], required_mod_y: [mod_y] (where [num] is the original number, [mod_x] is the remainder when [num] is divided by [x], [mod_y] is the remainder when [num] is divided by [y], [required_mod_x] is (x - mod_x) % x, and [required_mod_y] is the same as [mod_y])**
