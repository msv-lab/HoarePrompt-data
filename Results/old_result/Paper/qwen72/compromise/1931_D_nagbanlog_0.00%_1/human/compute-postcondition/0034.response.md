Output State: **`num` is the next element in `a`, `a` must have at least one more element, `mod_x` is `num % x`, `mod_y` is `num % y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`.**

Explanation:
- `num` remains the next element in `a`.
- `a` still must have at least one more element.
- `mod_x` is still `num % x`.
- `mod_y` is still `num % y`.
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. This value depends on the current values of `x` and `mod_x`.
