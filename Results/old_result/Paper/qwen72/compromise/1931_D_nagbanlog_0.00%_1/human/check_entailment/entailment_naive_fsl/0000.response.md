Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `y`. The current implementation only checks if the current number `num` can form a beautiful pair with any previously seen number based on the modulo conditions. However, it does not ensure that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` for all pairs `(i, j)`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- `n = 4`, `x = 3`, `y = 2`
- `a = [1, 2, 4, 5]`

The expected beautiful pairs are:
- \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\): \(a_1 + a_4 = 1 + 5 = 6\) (divisible by 3) and \(a_1 - a_4 = 1 - 5 = -4\) (divisible by 2).

However, the program will incorrectly count the pair \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\) as beautiful because:
- \(a_2 + a_3 = 2 + 4 = 6\) (divisible by 3) but \(a_2 - a_3 = 2 - 4 = -2\) (divisible by 2), which is incorrect because the pair \(\langle 2, 3 \rangle\) should not be counted as beautiful.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
