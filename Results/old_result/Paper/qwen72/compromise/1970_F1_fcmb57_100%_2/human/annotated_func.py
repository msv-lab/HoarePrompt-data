#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, where 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both a and b are odd.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program raises a TypeError because it attempts to unpack an integer into two variables (`x` and `y`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both expected to be integers. It attempts to unpack `a` into two variables `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. However, since `a` and `b` are single integers, this results in a `TypeError` being raised. The function does not return any values or modify the input parameters.
