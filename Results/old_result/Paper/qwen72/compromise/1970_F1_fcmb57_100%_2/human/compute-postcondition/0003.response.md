The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of the Quidditch field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. The function does not return a value; instead, it raises a `TypeError` because it attempts to unpack an integer into two variables (`x` and `y`).

Functionality: **The function accepts two odd integer parameters `a` and `b` within the range 3 to 99, and raises a `TypeError` due to an invalid attempt to unpack an integer.**
