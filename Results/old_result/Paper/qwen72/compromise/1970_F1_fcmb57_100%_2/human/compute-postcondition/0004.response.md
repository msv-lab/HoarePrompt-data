Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both expected to be integers. It attempts to unpack `a` into two variables `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. However, since `a` and `b` are single integers, this results in a `TypeError` being raised. The function does not return any values or modify the input parameters. **
