Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `numbers` (with at least 2 elements) and returns a single integer. This integer is the result of applying the function `func_1` successively to all elements in the `numbers` list, starting with the first element and continuing with each subsequent element. After the function concludes, the `numbers` list remains unchanged, and the returned value is the final result of the successive application of `func_1`. **
