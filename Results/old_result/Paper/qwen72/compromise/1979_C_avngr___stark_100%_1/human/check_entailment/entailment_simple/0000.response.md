### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves betting on `n` outcomes, each with a different multiplier `k_i`.
   - The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If no such distribution exists, the program should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
   - The function `func_2` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `k_i`.
   - The program then calculates the bet amounts `c_i` for each outcome as `m // k_i`, where `m` is the LCM of the multipliers.
   - It checks if the sum of the bet amounts `sum(c)` is less than `m`. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
   - If the sum of the bet amounts is less than `m`, it prints the bet amounts.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is used to ensure that the bet amounts are consistent across all outcomes.
   - The bet amount for the i-th outcome is `m // k_i`, which ensures that the total amount received back for any winning outcome is `k_i * (m // k_i) = m`.
   - The condition `sum(c) < m` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If `sum(c) >= m`, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and the program correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `sum(c) >= m` by outputting `-1`.
   - The program also handles the case where `n = 1` (though the problem guarantees `1 \le n \le 50` and `2 \le k_i \le 20`).

5. **Functionality:**
   - `func_1` correctly computes the LCM of two numbers.
   - `func_2` correctly computes the LCM of a list of numbers by successively applying `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states. It correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers, calculates the bet amounts, and checks the condition to ensure the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

### Correctness:
**True**
