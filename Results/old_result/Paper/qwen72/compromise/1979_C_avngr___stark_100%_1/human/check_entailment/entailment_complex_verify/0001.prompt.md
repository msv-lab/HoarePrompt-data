You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have been offered to play a game. In this game, there are n possible
outcomes, and for each of them, you must bet a certain integer amount of
coins. In the event that the i -th outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back the amount of coins equal to your bet on that outcome, multiplied
by k_i . Note that exactly one of the n outcomes will be winning.

Your task is to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you
will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. More formally, the
total amount of coins you bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the
number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 )
— the number of outcomes.

The second line of each test case contains n integers k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_n (2
\le k_i \le 20 ) — the multiplier for the amount of coins if the i -th outcome
turns out to be winning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output -1 if there is no way to distribute the coins as
required. Otherwise, output n integers x_1, x_2,\ldots, x_n (1 \le x_i \le
10^{9} ) — your bets on the outcomes.

It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that
satisfies these constraints.

If there are multiple suitable solutions, output any of them.

Note

In the first test case, the coins can be distributed as follows: 27 coins on
the first outcome, 41 coins on the second outcome, 12 coins on the third
outcome. Then the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is 27 + 41 + 12 =
80 coins. If the first outcome turns out to be winning, you will receive back
3 \cdot 27 = 81 coins, if the second outcome turns out to be winning, you will
receive back 2 \cdot 41 = 82 coins, if the third outcome turns out to be
winning, you will receive back 7 \cdot 12 = 84 coins. All these values are
strictly greater than 80 .

In the second test case, one way is to bet one coin on each of the outcomes.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that a > 0 and b > 0.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of the division of the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since `a` and `b` are both positive integers, the absolute value of their product is simply their product, and the result is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM is calculated by dividing the product of `a` and `b` by their greatest common divisor (GCD). Since `a` and `b` are both positive, the absolute value of their product is simply their product.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where len(numbers) >= 2.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: `result` is the final value obtained by applying `func_1` successively to all elements in the `numbers` list, starting with the first element.
    return result
    #The program returns the final value obtained by applying `func_1` successively to all elements in the `numbers` list, starting with the first element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of integers `numbers` (with at least 2 elements) and returns a single integer. This integer is the result of applying the function `func_1` successively to all elements in the `numbers` list, starting with the first element and continuing with each subsequent element. After the function concludes, the `numbers` list remains unchanged, and the returned value is the final result of the successive application of `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount of coins received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount of coins bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The condition can be rewritten as `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - This implies `sum(x_i) - x_i < (k_i - 1) * x_i` for all `i`.
   - Simplifying, we get `sum(x_j for j != i) < (k_i - 1) * x_i`.

3. **Finding a Solution:**
   - One way to ensure this condition is to set `x_i` such that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.
   - A straightforward approach is to set `x_i` to a value that is proportional to the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i - 1`.

4. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of a set of numbers can be calculated using the greatest common divisor (GCD) function.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - The function `func_2(numbers)` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

5. **Distributing the Coins:**
   - If the LCM of `k_i - 1` for all `i` is `L`, then setting `x_i = L // (k_i - 1)` will ensure that the condition `sum(x_j for j != i) < (k_i - 1) * x_i` is satisfied.
   - However, if all `k_i` are the same, the LCM will be 1, and the condition cannot be satisfied because `sum(x_i)` will be equal to `k_i * x_i`.

6. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` for LCM calculation and `func_2` for LCM of a list.
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where all `k_i` are the same, which would result in an LCM of 1 and no valid solution.
   - The program also does not explicitly handle the output of the bets or the `-1` case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not fully address the problem requirements. It lacks the necessary logic to handle the case where all `k_i` are the same and does not output the bets or the `-1` case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
