### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount of coins received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the amount of coins bet on outcome `i`.
   - The total amount of coins bet is `sum(x_i)`.
   - The condition to satisfy is `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.

2. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The condition can be rewritten as `sum(x_i) < k_i * x_i` for all `i`.
   - This implies `sum(x_i) - x_i < (k_i - 1) * x_i` for all `i`.
   - Simplifying, we get `sum(x_j for j != i) < (k_i - 1) * x_i`.

3. **Finding a Solution:**
   - One way to ensure this condition is to set `x_i` such that the sum of all other bets is less than `(k_i - 1) * x_i`.
   - A straightforward approach is to set `x_i` to a value that is proportional to the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i - 1`.

4. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The LCM of a set of numbers can be calculated using the greatest common divisor (GCD) function.
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` calculates the LCM of two numbers.
   - The function `func_2(numbers)` calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1`.

5. **Distributing the Coins:**
   - If the LCM of `k_i - 1` for all `i` is `L`, then setting `x_i = L // (k_i - 1)` will ensure that the condition `sum(x_j for j != i) < (k_i - 1) * x_i` is satisfied.
   - However, if all `k_i` are the same, the LCM will be 1, and the condition cannot be satisfied because `sum(x_i)` will be equal to `k_i * x_i`.

6. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` for LCM calculation and `func_2` for LCM of a list.
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where all `k_i` are the same, which would result in an LCM of 1 and no valid solution.
   - The program also does not explicitly handle the output of the bets or the `-1` case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not fully address the problem requirements. It lacks the necessary logic to handle the case where all `k_i` are the same and does not output the bets or the `-1` case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
