Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers, but they do not address the problem of distributing coins in a way that ensures a profit for any winning outcome.

To solve the problem, we need to find a distribution of coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The provided functions do not attempt to find such a distribution.

For example, consider the test case:
```
3
3 2 7
```
The correct output should be a distribution of coins like `27 41 12` (as mentioned in the example), but the provided program does not produce any such output. Instead, it computes the LCM of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
