Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if the favorite cube will be removed in all cases, not removed in any case, or may be either removed or left. The logic for determining the output is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Logic for "YES"**: The program checks if the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube is at least `k`. However, this does not guarantee that the favorite cube will always be among the first `k` cubes after sorting. The favorite cube could still be among the first `k` cubes if there are enough cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.

2. **Logic for "NO"**: The program checks if the sum of the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`. This condition is too strict. The favorite cube could still be among the first `k` cubes if there are enough cubes with the same value, but the program would incorrectly output "NO" in such cases.

3. **Logic for "MAYBE"**: The program outputs "MAYBE" if neither of the above conditions is met. However, this condition is not correctly formulated to cover all cases where the favorite cube might or might not be among the first `k` cubes.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Count the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube.
- Count the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube.
- Determine if the favorite cube can be among the first `k` cubes after sorting.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        # Count the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube
        greater_count = sum(1 for value in a if value > favorite_value)
        
        # Count the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube
        same_value_count = sum(1 for value in a if value == favorite_value)
        
        # Determine the position of the favorite cube after sorting
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count > k:
            print('MAYBE')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **"YES"**: If the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube is at least `k`, the favorite cube will always be among the first `k` cubes after sorting.
- **"NO"**: If the sum of the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will never be among the first `k` cubes after sorting.
- **"MAYBE"**: If the sum of the number of cubes with a value greater than the favorite cube and the number of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube is greater than `k`, the favorite cube might or might not be among the first `k` cubes after sorting, depending on the exact positions of the cubes with the same value.
