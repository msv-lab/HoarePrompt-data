Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, followed by a permutation `p` of length `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. It then performs a series of calculations to determine and print the result of a comparison between two computed values, `bm` and `sm`. The final output for each test case will be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on whether `bm` is greater than, less than, or equal to `sm`, respectively. The function does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, or `a` across different test cases. **
