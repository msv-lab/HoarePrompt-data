Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the lines where `bm` and `sm` are updated are incorrect. The program incorrectly adds the maximum of the current score and a calculated score, which does not follow the problem description. The correct approach should be to simply add the score at the current position to the total score for each player.

Here is a corrected version of the score calculation logic:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        for j in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

The original program's logic for updating `bm` and `sm` is flawed, leading to incorrect results. For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
Bodya
```
However, the original program might produce an incorrect result due to the flawed score calculation.
