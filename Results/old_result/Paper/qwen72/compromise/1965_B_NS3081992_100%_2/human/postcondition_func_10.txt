The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input provided by the user, split by whitespace. The function effectively reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines). After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned list of strings, and any variables that were not part of the function call remain unchanged.
