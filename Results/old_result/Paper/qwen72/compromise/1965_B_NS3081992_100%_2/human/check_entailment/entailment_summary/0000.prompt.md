Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_15()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer read from the standard input. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that an integer has been read from the standard input and is returned to the caller.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line from standard input, splits the line into parts, converts each part to an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The line must contain at least one integer.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  Reads a line of input from stdin, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` and returns a list containing `rows_number` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_3()`. If `rows_number` is 0, the function returns an empty list.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads the next line from the standard input, removes any trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the resulting string. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the next line of input from the standard input has been consumed and the function has returned the line with trailing whitespace removed.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads the next line of input from the standard input (stdin), strips any trailing newline characters, decodes the result from bytes to a string, and returns this string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function `func_7` reads a line of space-separated integers from the user input and returns a list of integers. The function does not take any parameters. After the function concludes, the user's input is converted into a list of integers, and this list is the final state of the program.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and returns a list containing the result of `func_7()` called `rows` times. The final state of the program is that it has a list with `rows` elements, each element being the result of a call to `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the user's input as the return value.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that is input by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer, which is the user's input converted to an integer.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function `func_11` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input provided by the user, split by whitespace. The function effectively reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of substrings based on whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines). After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned list of strings, and any variables that were not part of the function call remain unchanged.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d` (a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers), `processing` (a list of integers of length at least the maximum value of `da` and the maximum integer in `d[da]`, initialized to 0), `da` (an integer key present in `d`), and `rank` (a list of integers of length at least the maximum value of `da` and the maximum integer in `d[da]`, initialized to 0). If the list `d[da]` has exactly one element, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (as indicated by `processing[di - 1]` being 0), and updates the `rank[da - 1]` with the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. The function ultimately returns this minimum value plus 1. The dictionary `d` and the list `processing` remain unchanged by the end of the function, while the list `rank` is updated.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not 0). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively computes the values by calling itself with `b` and `a % b`.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14():
    (n, k) = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if k == 1:
        if n == 2:
            return '1\n2'
        ans = [2, 3]
        for i in range(2, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    else:
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))
        ans.append(k + 1)
        ans.append(2 * k + 1)
        for i in range(lk, l):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function `func_14` takes no parameters and returns a string. The string returned depends on the values of `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7()`. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` and returns a string that consists of the length of `ans` followed by a newline character and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. If `k` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the number 2 repeated `l` times, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. If `k` is not 1, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and then powers of 2 from \(2^{lk-1}\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` and `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_14()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It writes the output of `func_14()` to the standard output, followed by a newline character, for a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. After the function concludes, the standard output will contain the results of `func_14()` for each test case, each on a new line. The state of `func_10()` and `func_14()` remains unchanged.
