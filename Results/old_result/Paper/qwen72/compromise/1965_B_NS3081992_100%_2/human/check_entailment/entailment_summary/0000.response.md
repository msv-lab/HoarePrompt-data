### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_14()` reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case using `func_7()`, which reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.

2. **Sequence Construction:**
   - The function `func_14()` constructs a sequence `ans` based on the values of `n` and `k`:
     - If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, it returns a specific sequence '1\n2'.
     - If `k` is 1, it constructs a sequence of powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n` minus 1.
     - If `k` is not 1, it constructs a sequence that includes powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`. It then adds `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and continues with powers of 2 up to `2^(l-1)`, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Output:**
   - `func_15()` calls `func_14()` for each test case and writes the result to the standard output, ensuring that the output format matches the problem description.

4. **Validation of Conditions:**
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by some subsequence.
   - For `k == 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid summing to 1 and to include all other values up to `n`.
   - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid summing to `k` by carefully choosing elements and ensuring that all other values can be formed.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `k` is 1 and `n` is 2 correctly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is of size at most 25, which is within the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions together correctly solve the problem as described. The sequence construction logic in `func_14()` ensures that the conditions of the problem are met, and the input and output handling in `func_10()` and `func_15()` are appropriate.

**Correctness: **True****
