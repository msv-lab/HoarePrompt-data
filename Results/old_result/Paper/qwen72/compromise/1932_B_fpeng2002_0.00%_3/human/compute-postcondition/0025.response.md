Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The list `nums` remains unchanged.
- The variable `x` is now equal to `len(nums) - 1`, which is the index of the last element in the list `nums`.
- The variable `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of each integer in `nums` that is greater than the previous value of `start_year`, starting from 0 and progressing through each element in the list `nums` in order.
