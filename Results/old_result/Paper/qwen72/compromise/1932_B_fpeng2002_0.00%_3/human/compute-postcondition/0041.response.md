The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `periods` where each inner list contains integers representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case. The constraints are 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and for each inner list, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines the periodicity of the signs and returns a specific value based on this periodicity.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists `periods`. It returns a list of results, where each result is determined based on the periodicities of the signs provided in the inner lists.**
