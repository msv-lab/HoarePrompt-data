Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least two elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than `start_year + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates `start_year` to be the smallest multiple of `nums[2]` that is greater than `start_year + 1`.
- The value of `nums` and `x` remain unchanged.
- The new `start_year` is calculated using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[2] + 1) * nums[2]`, which ensures that `start_year` is the next multiple of `nums[2]` after `start_year + 1`.
