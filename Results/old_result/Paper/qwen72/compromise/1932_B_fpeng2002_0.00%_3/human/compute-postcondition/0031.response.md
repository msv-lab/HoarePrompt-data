Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is 0, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `start_year` to 0, overriding any previous value.
- The value of `x` remains `len(nums) - 1`.
- The value of `num_tests` is decreased by 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The list `nums` remains unchanged and still holds the integers input by the user.
