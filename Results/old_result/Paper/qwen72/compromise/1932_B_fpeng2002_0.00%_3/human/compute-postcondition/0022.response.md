Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is 1, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`.** 

Explanation: The code updates `start_year` to the next multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the previous `start_year`. The value of `x` remains 1, and `nums` remains the list of integers input by the user.
