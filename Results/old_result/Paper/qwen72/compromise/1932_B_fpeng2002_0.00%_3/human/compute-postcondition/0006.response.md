The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `nums`. For the loop to execute, the list `nums` must have at least one element, and the variable `x` should start from 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `num_tests` is now one less than its initial value, but still greater than 0 (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `n` is an input integer (this is not relevant to the loop head).
- `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces.
- `start_year` is 0 (this is not relevant to the loop head).

To ensure the loop executes, `nums` must have at least one element, and `x` should start from 0.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least one element, `x` is 0**
