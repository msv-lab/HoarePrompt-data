Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 1, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the original `start_year`, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the original `start_year`.
- The value of `x` remains 1.
- The value of `num_tests` is decreased by 1.
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The list `nums` remains unchanged.
