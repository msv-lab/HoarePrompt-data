Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case. `num_tests` is the integer value of the input provided.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, separated by spaces, and must have at least `num_tests` elements, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[len(nums) - 1]` that is greater than `start_year + 1` after all iterations.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the previous `start_year` for each `x` in `range(0, len(nums))`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than the previous `start_year`, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
