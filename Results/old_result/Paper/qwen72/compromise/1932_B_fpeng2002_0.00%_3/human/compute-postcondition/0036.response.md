The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `nums`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums` and the value of `x`. If `x` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 1 and `nums` is a list that must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `x` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `nums` must still have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is 2, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[1]` that is greater than the original `start_year`, `num_tests` is decreased by 1, and `n` is an input integer.**
