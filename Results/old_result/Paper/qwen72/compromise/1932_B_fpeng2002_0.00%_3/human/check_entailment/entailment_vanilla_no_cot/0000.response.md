Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year before the first sign occurs.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: It iterates through each sign's periodicity and calculates the next occurrence year for each sign.
   - The expression `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous sign.
   - `start_year + 1` is used to ensure that the next sign occurs in the year following the current year.
   - `// nums[x]` and `+ 1` are used to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`.
   - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year when the next sign occurs.
4. **Output**: After processing all signs for a test case, it prints the year when the last sign occurs.

This logic correctly follows the problem's requirements and produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
