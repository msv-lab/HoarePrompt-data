### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and initializes `total_digits` to 0 and `zeros` to an empty list.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program iterates over each item in `array`, converting it to a string to count the number of digits and to check for trailing zeros.
   - It adds the length of each item to `total_digits`.
   - It calls `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each item and appends the result to the `zeros` list if the count is greater than 0.

3. **Trailing Zeros Handling:**
   - The `zeros` list is sorted in descending order.
   - The program then iterates over the sorted `zeros` list, summing every second element starting from the first (i.e., `zeros[i]` where `i` is even) to `subtract_zero`.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it sets the result for the current test case to 'Sashah' (which should be 'Sasha').
   - Otherwise, it sets the result to 'Anna'.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error:** The result for Sasha is incorrectly set to 'Sashah' instead of 'Sasha'. This is a typo and should be corrected.
- **Trailing Zeros Calculation:** The function `func_1` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a string representation of the number. However, the logic for handling these zeros in the main loop is not clear and may not be optimal for the game rules.
- **Optimal Play:** The program does not explicitly simulate the game turns or consider the optimal moves for both players. It only uses a heuristic based on the total number of digits and trailing zeros, which may not always correctly determine the winner.

### Correctness:
- The program has a typo that affects the output.
- The logic for determining the winner based on the total number of digits and trailing zeros is not clearly aligned with the game rules, which involve reversing digits and concatenating numbers.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program contains a typo and does not correctly simulate the game to determine the winner based on the optimal play. It needs to be revised to accurately reflect the game rules and logic.
