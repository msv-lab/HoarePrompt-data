### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array`.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `array` by summing the lengths of the string representations of the integers.
   - It uses the function `func_1` to count the trailing zeros in each integer and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the trailing zeros in a given number (as a string).
   - It iterates from the end of the string and increments a counter until it encounters a non-zero digit.
   - The function returns the count of trailing zeros.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program attempts to determine if Sasha can win by calculating the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros.
   - It sorts the list of trailing zeros in descending order and subtracts the sum of every second element from the total number of digits.
   - This subtraction is intended to simulate the effect of Anna's moves, where she can reverse the digits of a number, potentially reducing the number of digits that can be concatenated by Sasha.

5. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if the absolute difference between the total number of digits and the subtracted trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If this condition is met, it assigns 'Sashah' to the answer (which is incorrect, as it should be 'Sasha').
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'Anna' to the answer.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Typographical Error**: The program assigns 'Sashah' instead of 'Sasha' when Sasha wins. This is a typo and should be corrected.
- **Logical Error**: The logic for determining the winner is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play for both players. Specifically, the way it handles the trailing zeros and the total digit count does not accurately reflect the game's rules and the optimal strategies for both players.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program contains a typographical error and a logical error in determining the winner. The logic for simulating the game and the optimal play is not correct, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sasha'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Typographical Error**: Changed 'Sashah' to 'Sasha'.
- **Logical Error**: The condition `if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:` was incorrect. The absolute value is not necessary, and the correct condition should be `if total_digits - subtract_zero >= m + 1:` to determine if Sasha can win by having a number with at least `m + 1` digits after all moves.

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program should now correctly determine the winner based on the problem description and the optimal play for both players.
