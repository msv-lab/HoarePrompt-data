#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer in num satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is an integer m such that 0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6, which is used to determine the winning condition.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in the list `num`, and the loop has stopped at the first non-zero element from the end of the list.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the list `num` up to the first non-zero element from the end of the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the list, counting from the end of the list up to the first non-zero element. The input list `num` remains unchanged after the function call.
