The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a list of integers where the length of the list is between 1 and 200,000, and each integer in the list is between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The function returns the number of trailing zeros in the list `num` up to the first non-zero element from the end of the list.
