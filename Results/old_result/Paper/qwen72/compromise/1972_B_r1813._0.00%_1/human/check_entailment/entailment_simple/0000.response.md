### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It initializes `index` to 0 and reads the number of test cases `t` from the first element of the list.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Game Logic:**
   - The program counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - It then checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd or even.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win, and the program appends `'YES'` to the `results` list.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will win, and the program appends `'NO'` to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the program prints each result in the `results` list.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly:
     - If there are no facing-up coins, the player whose turn it is loses.
     - If there are only one or two coins left, the game logic is correctly applied.

5. **Optimal Play:**
   - The game logic is based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. This is a correct approach because:
     - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains odd after her turn, forcing Bob to play with an even number of facing-up coins, which eventually leads to Bob losing.
     - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always ensure that the number of facing-up coins remains even after his turn, forcing Alice to play with an odd number of facing-up coins, which eventually leads to Alice losing.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the game logic and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
