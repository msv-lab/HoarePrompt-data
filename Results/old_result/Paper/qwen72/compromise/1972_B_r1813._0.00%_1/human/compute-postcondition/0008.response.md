The only objects in the loop head are `result` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must be a non-empty list. The state of `index` and `t` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given that the loop will execute if `results` contains at least one element, the state should be adjusted to ensure `results` is not empty. The variable `result` will take the value of the first element in `results` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `t` remains the same as the initial value, `results` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `result` is the first element in `results`**
