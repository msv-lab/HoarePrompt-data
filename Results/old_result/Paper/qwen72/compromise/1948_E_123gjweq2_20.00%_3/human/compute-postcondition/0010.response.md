Functionality: ** The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It modifies the elements in the range `[left, right]` of the `arr` list, assigning them values in a specific pattern: the first half of the range is assigned values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`, and the second half is assigned values from `right + 1 - (right - left + 1 - mid)` to `right + 1`. Additionally, it assigns the value of `clique` to the elements in the same range `[left, right]` in the `cliquess` list. The function does not return any value. **
