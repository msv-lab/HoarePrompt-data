### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to assign integers to vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - For \( k \ge n \), the graph should be a complete graph, meaning all vertices should be connected to each other, and thus all vertices should belong to a single clique.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - The function calculates the number of cliques as `cliques = ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
     - It then calls `make_array` for each segment of the graph, which is defined by the range `[i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)]` and the clique number `i + 1`.
     - After the loop, it prints the `arr` list, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` list.

   - **Function `make_array`:**
     - This function assigns values to the `arr` list and the `cliquess` list for a given segment.
     - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on the `left` and `right` indices.
     - It divides the segment into two parts: the first half is assigned values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the second half is assigned values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element`.
     - Both parts are assigned the same clique number.

3. **Evaluating the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where \( k \ge n \).
   - For \( k \ge n \), the number of cliques should be 1, and all vertices should belong to this single clique.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` will still calculate `cliques = ceil(n / k)`, which will be 1 if \( k \ge n \).
   - The `make_array` function will then be called with `left = 0` and `right = n - 1`, and the entire `arr` list will be filled with values from 1 to n, and the `cliquess` list will be filled with the clique number 1.
   - Therefore, the output for \( k \ge n \) will be:
     ```
     1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
     1
     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
     ```
   - This output is correct for the given problem description, as it forms a single clique with all vertices.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is incorrect because the program does handle the case where \( k \ge n \) correctly.
   - The program ensures that when \( k \ge n \), all vertices are assigned to a single clique, which is the expected behavior.
