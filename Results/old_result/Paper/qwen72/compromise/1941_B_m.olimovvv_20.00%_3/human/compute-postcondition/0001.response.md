Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. The loop has finished executing, and for each test case, the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked in the loop.**
