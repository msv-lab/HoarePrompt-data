The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can consider as a variable for the purpose of this task. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
