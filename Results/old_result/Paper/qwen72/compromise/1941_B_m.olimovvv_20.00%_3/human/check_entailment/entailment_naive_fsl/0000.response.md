Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the input where the array is `[0, 1, 1, 0]`. According to the problem description, it is impossible to make all elements zero because the operation requires at least three elements to be non-zero, and the first and last elements are already zero. However, the program will output "YES" for this case, which is incorrect. The program only checks the first and last elements for specific conditions but does not consider the overall feasibility of making all elements zero.
