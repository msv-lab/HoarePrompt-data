### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing elements from an array `a` until it is empty.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `S` of the array and the array `N` itself.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the process of finding the MEX.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks the loop, as the MEX has been found.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
     - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` containing all unique integers in `N` that have a count of 1 in `M`.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second smallest unique integer in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The program correctly sorts the array and uses a dictionary to count occurrences.
   - The loop correctly identifies the MEX by breaking when a gap is found.
   - However, the logic for handling the case where the sum of counts equals `S` and the logic for setting `cur` to the second smallest unique integer in `cnt` are problematic:
     - The condition `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. If all elements are unique and consecutive, the MEX should be `S` (or `S + 1` if `S` is not in the array).
     - The logic `if len(cnt) >= 2: cur = cnt[1]` is also incorrect. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the array, not necessarily the second smallest unique integer.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach to find the MEX is to iterate through the sorted array and break when a gap is found.
   - If the array is completely filled with unique and consecutive integers starting from 0, the MEX should be the next integer after the largest integer in the array.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program contains logical errors in the handling of the MEX calculation, particularly in the conditions and the final setting of `cur`. The correct MEX should be determined by the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c` constructed by Alice. The current logic does not accurately reflect this.
