Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `cur` is now equal to `num`, `M[cur]` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `M[cur] = 1` sets the value of the dictionary `M` at the key `cur` to 1. Since `cur` is equal to `num`, and `num` is the third element in the sorted list `N`, the value of `M[num]` is now 1. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
