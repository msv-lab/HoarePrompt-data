Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `cnt` is an empty list, `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`, `num` is the first element in `N`, and `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, and `M[-1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of `M[cur]` by 1.
- Since `cur` is -1 and `M` is initially an empty dictionary, this line of code implicitly initializes `M[-1]` to 0 before incrementing it to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
