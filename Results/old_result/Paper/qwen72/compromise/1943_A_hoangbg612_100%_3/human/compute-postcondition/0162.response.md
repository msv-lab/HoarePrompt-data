Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a`, then iterates through the sorted list to find the largest integer `cur` such that all integers in `a` up to `cur` are unique and consecutive starting from 0. If the sum of the counts of these unique integers equals `n`, it increments `cur` by 1. Finally, it prints the value of `cur`. If there are at least two unique integers in `a` that are consecutive and have a count of 1, `cur` is set to the second smallest of these integers before printing. **
