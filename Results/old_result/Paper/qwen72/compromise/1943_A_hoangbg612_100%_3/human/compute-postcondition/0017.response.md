Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > `cur` and `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is updated to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` > `cur` but `num` ≤ `cur` + 1, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[cur] += 1` raises a `KeyError` because `cur` is -1 and `M` is an empty dictionary, so `M[cur]` does not exist.**
