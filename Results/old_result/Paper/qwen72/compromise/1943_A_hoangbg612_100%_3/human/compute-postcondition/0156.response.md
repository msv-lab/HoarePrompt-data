Postcondition: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`, `cnt` is a list containing all the unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and have a count of 1 in `M`, and the length of `cnt` is at least 2.**
