Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `cur` is the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1, `M` is a dictionary with keys being the elements in `N` that are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^4.
- The variable `T` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0.
- The variable `n` remains an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5.
- The list `a` remains a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 0 and `n` - 1.
- The variable `S` remains an input integer.
- The list `N` remains a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- The variable `cur` is updated to the last element in `N` or the largest element in `N` that is not greater than `cur` + 1.
- The dictionary `M` contains keys that are the elements in `N` which are not greater than `cur` + 1, and each key's value is the count of consecutive occurrences of that key in `N` up to the point where the loop breaks or ends. If the loop breaks, the dictionary `M` will only contain the keys and values up to the point of breaking.
