Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 2 elements, `_` is `_ + 1` and must be less than `T`, `num` is the second element in `N`, `cur` is `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value, and if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `cur` remains -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `M[-1]` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `cur += 1` increments the value of `cur` by 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
- If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `num` ≤ `cur`, `cur` remains -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, and `M[-1]` is 1. However, since `cur` is now `cur + 1`, this condition is no longer relevant.
- The dictionary `M` is updated to have `cur` as a key with a value of 1.
