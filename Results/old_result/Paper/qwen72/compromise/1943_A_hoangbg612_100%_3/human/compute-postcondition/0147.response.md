Output State: **`N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key (which is `cur`), `cnt` is a list containing the key `k` (which is `cur`), and the value of `M` at key `k` is 1.**

Explanation: The code `cnt.append(k)` adds the key `k` to the list `cnt`. Since `k` is the same as `cur`, `cnt` now contains the value of `cur`. The other variables and their properties remain unchanged.
