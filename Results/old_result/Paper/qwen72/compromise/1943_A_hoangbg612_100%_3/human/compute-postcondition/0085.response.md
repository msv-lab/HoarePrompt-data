The code snippet `M[cur] += 1` increments the value of the element in the dictionary `M` at the key `cur` by 1. Since `cur` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a valid key in the dictionary `M`. The initial state of `M` is not provided, so we can only state that the value associated with `cur` in `M` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `M[cur]` is incremented by 1.**
