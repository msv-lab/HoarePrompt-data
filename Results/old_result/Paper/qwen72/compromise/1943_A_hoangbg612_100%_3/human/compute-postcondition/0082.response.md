Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`. If `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is increased by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying `cur`.***
