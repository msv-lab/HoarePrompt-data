Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in N:
    if num > cur:
        if num > cur + 1:
            cur += 1
            break
        cur = num
        M[cur] = 1
    else:
        M[cur] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `N`. If `num` > `cur` and `num` > `cur` + 1, `cur` is updated to 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` > `cur` but `num` ≤ `cur` + 1, `cur` is updated to `num` and `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and 1 as its value. If `num` ≤ `cur`, `M[cur] += 1` raises a `KeyError` because `cur` is -1 and `M` is an empty dictionary, so `M[cur]` does not exist.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key. If `num` > `cur`, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 1, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M` has `cur` as a key with a value of 0, and `cur` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key. If `num` > `cur`, `M[cur]` is 1, and `cur` is updated to `num`. Otherwise, `M[cur]` is 1, and `cur` remains -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
