To determine what will be printed by the `print(cur)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - `T` is an input integer where \(1 \le T \le 2 \cdot 10^4\) and must be greater than 0.
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \le a_i < n\).
   - `S` is an input integer.
   - `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
   - `M` is a dictionary with keys from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance.
   - `_` is updated to `_ + len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must be less than `T`.
   - `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest integer in `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.

2. **Determine the Value of `cur`:**
   - The value of `cur` depends on the list `cnt`.
   - `cnt` contains all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1.
   - If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` is the second smallest integer in `cnt`.
   - If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.

3. **Evaluate the Conditions:**
   - Since the exact values of `N` and `M` are not provided, we need to consider the general case.
   - If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, `cur` will be the second smallest integer in `cnt`.
   - If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements, `cur` will be the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.

4. **Output:**
   - If `cnt` has at least 2 elements, the output will be the second smallest integer in `cnt`.
   - If `cnt` has fewer than 2 elements, the output will be the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.

Given the complexity and the lack of specific values for `N` and `M`, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **cur (where cur is the second smallest integer in cnt if cnt has at least 2 elements, otherwise cur is the largest integer in N that is not greater than cur + 1 at any point during the loop execution)**
