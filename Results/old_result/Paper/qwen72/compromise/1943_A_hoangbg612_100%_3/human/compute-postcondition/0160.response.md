Output State: **`T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be 0, `N` is a sorted list of integers, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop, `M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`, and `cnt` is a list containing all the unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and have a count of 1 in `M`. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest unique integer in `cnt` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `T` times, and after all iterations, `T` must be 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations.
- For each iteration, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input.
- `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop. If the loop breaks early due to a non-consecutive integer, `cur` will be the last integer that was consecutive.
- `M` is a dictionary that tracks the counts of integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution.
- `cnt` is a list containing all unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and have a count of 1 in `M`.
- If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is set to the second smallest unique integer in `cnt`.
- The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
