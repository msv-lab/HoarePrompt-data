Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `cur` is the second smallest integer in `cnt`, `M` is a dictionary with keys from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance, `_` is `_ + len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must be less than `T`, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1, and the length of `cnt` is at least 2.**
