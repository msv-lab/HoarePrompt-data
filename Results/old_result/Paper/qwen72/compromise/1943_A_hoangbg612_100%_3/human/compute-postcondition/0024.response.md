Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in `N`, `M` is a dictionary with `cur` as a key and its value is 0, `cur` is -1.**

Explanation: The code `M[cur] += 1` attempts to increment the value of the key `cur` in the dictionary `M` by 1. However, since `M` is initially an empty dictionary and `cur` is -1, this will raise a `KeyError` because -1 is not yet a key in `M`. Therefore, the dictionary `M` will be updated to include the key `cur` with a value of 0, and then the value will be incremented to 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
