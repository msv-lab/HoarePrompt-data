Output State: **`N` is now a sorted list of integers, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `M` is an empty dictionary, `_` is `_ + len(N) * len(M.keys())` and must be less than `T`, `cnt` is a list containing all keys `k` from `M` where `M[k]` is 1. If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest integer in `cnt`. Otherwise, `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, `cur` is -1.**
