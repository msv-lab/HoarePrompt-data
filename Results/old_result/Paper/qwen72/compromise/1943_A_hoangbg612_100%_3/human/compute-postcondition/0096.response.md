The only objects in the loop head are the variable `k` and the dictionary `M`. The loop iterates over the keys of `M`, so the state of `k` will be adjusted to the next key in `M` for the loop to execute one more time. The state of `M` must remain such that it still has keys left to iterate over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input
- `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution
- `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, where each key is an integer from `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance
- `_` is `_ + len(N)` and must be less than `T`
- `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` contains the first key `k` from `M`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list

For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `k` will be the next key in `M` after the current key.
- `M` must still have keys left to iterate over.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a sorted list of integers read from the input, `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, `M` is a dictionary with at least one key, where each key is an integer from `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at any point during the loop execution, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appeared in `N` and was not greater than `cur + 1` at the time of its appearance, `_` is `_ + len(N)` and must be less than `T`, `cnt` is a list. If `M[k]` is 1, `cnt` contains the first key `k` from `M`. Otherwise, `cnt` remains an empty list, `k` is the next key in `M` after the current key**
