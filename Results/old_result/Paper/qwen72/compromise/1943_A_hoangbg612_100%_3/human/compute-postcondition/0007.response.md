The only objects in the loop head are the variable `num` and the list `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must contain at least one element. The state of `num` will be the first element of `N` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4
- `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n
- `S` is an input integer
- `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5
- `cur` is -1
- `M` is an empty dictionary

To ensure the loop executes, `N` must have at least one element. The variable `num` will be the first element of `N` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, `T` is an input integer where 1 ≤ T ≤ 2 · 10^4 and must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, `S` is an input integer, `N` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order and must have at least 1 element, `cur` is -1, `M` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element in `N`**
