Postcondition: ***`N` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in `N`, and `cur` is greater than or equal to the original value of `num`. If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, `cur` is increased by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cur` remains unchanged.***
