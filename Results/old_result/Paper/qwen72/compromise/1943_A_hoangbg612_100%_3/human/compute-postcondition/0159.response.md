Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`N` is a sorted list of integers.**
   - This means the elements in `N` are in ascending order.
2. **`cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop.**
   - This implies that `cur` is the largest integer in `N` that is less than or equal to `cur + 1`. Since `cur` is an integer, this condition is always true for the largest integer in `N`.
3. **`M` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique integers in `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and the values are the counts of these integers in `N`.**
   - This means `M` contains the counts of all unique integers in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur + 1`.
4. **`cnt` is a list containing all the unique integers from `N` that are not greater than `cur + 1` and have a count of 1 in `M`.**
   - This means `cnt` contains all unique integers in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur + 1` and appear exactly once in `N`.
5. **If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, `cur` is the second smallest unique integer in `cnt` that is not greater than `cur + 1` at the start of the loop.**
   - This means if `cnt` has at least two elements, `cur` is set to the second smallest element in `cnt`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(cur)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`:**
   - Since `N` is sorted, the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1` is simply the largest integer in `N` that is less than or equal to `cur + 1`.
   - Let's denote this largest integer as `cur`.

2. **Construct the dictionary `M`:**
   - `M` will contain the counts of all unique integers in `N` that are less than or equal to `cur + 1`.

3. **Construct the list `cnt`:**
   - `cnt` will contain all unique integers from `N` that are less than or equal to `cur + 1` and appear exactly once in `N`.

4. **Check the length of `cnt`:**
   - If `len(cnt) >= 2`, then `cur` is set to the second smallest element in `cnt`.

### Final Output:
- If `cnt` has at least two elements, `cur` will be the second smallest unique integer in `cnt` that is not greater than `cur + 1`.
- If `cnt` has fewer than two elements, the value of `cur` remains the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`.

Since the exact values of `N` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `cur`. However, based on the conditions given, the output will be:

Output: **cur (where cur is the second smallest unique integer in `cnt` if `cnt` has at least 2 elements, otherwise cur is the largest integer in `N` that is not greater than `cur + 1`)**
