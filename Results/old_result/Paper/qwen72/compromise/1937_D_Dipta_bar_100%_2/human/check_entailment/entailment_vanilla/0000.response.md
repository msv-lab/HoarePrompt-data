### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case with the grid string `s` as an argument.
   - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements of pinballs starting from the left and right, respectively.

3. **Left to Right Movement (`A` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '>', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `A` and the positions stored in `idx_A`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated as the sum of the previous cumulative movement plus the distance from the last '>' to the current cell, multiplied by the number of '>' encountered so far.
   - The position `i` of each '>' is stored in `idx_A`.

4. **Right to Left Movement (`B` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '<', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `B` and the positions stored in `idx_B`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated similarly to the left to right movement, but in reverse.
   - The position `i` of each '<' is stored in `idx_B`.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each cell `i` of the grid to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative movements based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' encountered.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each cell `i` in the grid.
   - The output is formatted correctly, with each time separated by a space.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for calculating the cumulative movements and adjusting them based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' is sound.
- The program ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps, as required.

However, there are a few potential issues and improvements to consider:
- The program does not handle edge cases where the grid length `n` is 1, which should be straightforward (the pinball leaves immediately).
- The logic for calculating the time in the `elif` and `else` blocks could be simplified and made more readable.
- The program could be optimized to reduce the number of conditional checks and improve performance.

Despite these minor issues, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
