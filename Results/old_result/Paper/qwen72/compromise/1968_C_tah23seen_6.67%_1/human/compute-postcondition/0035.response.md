Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of `n` integers, where the first element `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and each subsequent element `ans[i]` (for \(1 \leq i < n-1\)) is the smallest multiple of `ans[i-1]` that is greater than `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]` if `ans[i]` is less than `arr[i]`. Otherwise, `ans[i]` remains as `arr[i-1] + ans[i-1]`. The final element `ans[n-1]` is updated to `ans[n-2] + arr[n-1]`.**
