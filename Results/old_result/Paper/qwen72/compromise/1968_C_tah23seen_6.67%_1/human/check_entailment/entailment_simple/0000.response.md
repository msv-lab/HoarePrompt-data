### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` of `n-1` integers.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function initializes an array `ans` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `ans[0]` to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that `a_1` is greater than `x_2`, which is a valid starting point.
   - It then iterates through the array `arr` to compute the subsequent elements of `ans`.

3. **Element Calculation:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, it sets `ans[i + 1]` to `arr[i] + ans[i]`. This is a valid initial guess for `a_{i+1}` because it ensures that `a_{i+1}` is greater than `a_i` and `a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = arr[i]`.
   - If `ans[i + 1]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`, it increments `ans[i + 1]` by `ans[i]` until `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i + 1]`. This ensures that `a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = arr[i]` and `a_{i+1}` is a valid multiple of `a_i`.

4. **Final Element:**
   - The final element `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`. This ensures that the last condition `a_n \bmod a_{n-1} = x_n` is satisfied.
   - There is no additional check for the final element, but it is not necessary because the final element is always computed as a valid multiple of the previous element.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the elements of `ans` for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program follows the problem description and ensures that the conditions are met for each test case. The logic for computing the elements of `ans` is sound and correctly handles the constraints and requirements.

**Correctness: True**
