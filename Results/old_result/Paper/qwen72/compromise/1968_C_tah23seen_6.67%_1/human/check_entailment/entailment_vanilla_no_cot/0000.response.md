Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the `func_1` function constructs an array `a` such that the conditions \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \) are satisfied for all \( 2 \le i \le n \). Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The first element of `ans` is set to `arr[0] + 1`. This ensures that \( a_2 \bmod a_1 = x_2 \) because \( a_2 = x_2 + a_1 \) and \( a_1 = x_2 + 1 \).

2. **Constructing the Array**:
   - For each subsequent element \( a_i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)), the program sets \( a_i = x_i + a_{i-1} \). This ensures that \( a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i \) because \( a_i \) is constructed to be exactly one more than a multiple of \( a_{i-1} \).
   - If \( a_i \) is less than \( x_{i+1} \), the program ensures that \( a_i \) is increased to a value that is greater than \( x_{i+1} \) by repeatedly adding \( a_{i-1} \). This is necessary to ensure that \( a_{i+1} \bmod a_i = x_{i+1} \).

3. **Final Element**:
   - The last element \( a_n \) is set to \( a_{n-1} + x_n \). This ensures that \( a_n \bmod a_{n-1} = x_n \).

The program correctly handles the constraints and the logic ensures that the conditions are met for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
