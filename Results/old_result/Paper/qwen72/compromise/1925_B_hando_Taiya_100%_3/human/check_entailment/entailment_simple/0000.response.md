### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input, where `x` is the difficulty of the original problem and `n` is the number of sub-problems.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems.
   - It iterates over all integers `i` from 1 to the integer square root of `x` (inclusive) using `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
   - If `i` is a divisor, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems such that their sum is `x` and there are `n` sub-problems.
   - The balance is maximized when the difficulties of the sub-problems are as evenly distributed as possible, which means the GCD of the difficulties should be as large as possible.
   - The program checks all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` to find the largest divisor that can be used to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems. This is a valid approach because if `i` is a divisor of `x`, then `x // i` is also a divisor, and one of these divisors will be the largest possible GCD that can be used to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `n` is 1, the only sub-problem will have difficulty `x`, and the GCD will be `x`.
   - When `n` is equal to `x`, the only way to divide `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with difficulty 1, so the GCD will be 1.
   - The program correctly handles these edge cases by checking if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and `i`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a loop that runs up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient given the constraints (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems. The logic and the conditions used are appropriate for the given constraints and problem requirements.

### Correctness:
