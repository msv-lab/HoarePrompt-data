Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i - 1 < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that will store the operations, and `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, the element at `arr[start_index + (i - 1)]` is equal to `i - 1`, and the function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called. Otherwise, all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` in `arr` are set to `i - 1`, and `res` now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`.***
