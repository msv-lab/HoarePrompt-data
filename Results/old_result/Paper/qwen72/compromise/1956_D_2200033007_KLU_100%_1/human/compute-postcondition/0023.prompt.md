You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integer parameters `start_index` and `end_index`, and a list `arr` of integers. It returns an empty list if the sublist is empty. If `arr[start_index]` is less than or equal to 0, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. If the maximum value in the sublist is equal to the square of the sublist's length, it returns a list containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with adjusted indices and returns the result.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns an empty list.

Case_2: The program returns a list containing a single tuple (start_index, start_index), where `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` < len(`arr`) and `arr[start_index]` is less than or equal to 0.

Case_3: The program returns a list `res` containing the tuple `(start_index, end_index)`, where `start_index` and `end_index` are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(`arr`), and `end_index - start_index + 1` is greater than 1. The maximum value in the sublist `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` is equal to the square of the length of this sublist.

Case_4: The program returns the result of `func_2(start_index + 1, end_index)`. This is the value computed by the function `func_2` using the indices `start_index + 1` and `end_index` as its arguments.

Case_5: The program returns the result of `func_2(start_index, end_index - 1)`, where `start_index` and `end_index` are indices in the list `arr`, and `end_index - 1` is one position before the last element in the range from `start_index` to `end_index`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
