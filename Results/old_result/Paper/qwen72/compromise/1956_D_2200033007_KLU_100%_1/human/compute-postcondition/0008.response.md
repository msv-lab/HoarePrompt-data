Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer and equals 0, `arr` is a list of integers with `arr[start_index]` now set to 1, `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= start_index + i < len(arr), `res` is a list of tuples that contains one tuple: `(start_index, start_index)`, `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` does not match its index.**
