The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(arr), and `arr` is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value based on the following conditions: If the key `(start_index, end_index)` is already in the dictionary `res_dict`, it returns the value associated with this key. If `start_index` is equal to `end_index`, it returns the maximum of 1 and the integer at the position `start_index` in the list `arr`, and this value is also stored in `res_dict` under the key `(start_index, end_index)`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum value among the length of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`, the sum of the results of `func_1(start_index, i - 1)` and `func_1(i + 1, end_index)` plus the integer at position `i` in the list `arr` for each `i` in the range (`start_index` + 1, `end_index`), the sum of the integer at position `start_index` and the result of `func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)`, and the sum of the integer at position `end_index` and the result of `func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)`. This maximum value is stored in `res_dict` under the key `(start_index, end_index)` and is returned.
