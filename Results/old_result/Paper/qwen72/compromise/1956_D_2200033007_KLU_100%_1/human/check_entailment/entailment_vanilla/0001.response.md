### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that selects a subarray and sets all elements in the subarray to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**
   - This function computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where the maximum sum is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
   - For larger subarrays, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different partitions and the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It first computes the maximum value for the subarray using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the corresponding operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" and appends the operation to the result.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the partition that achieves the maximum value and constructs the operations for those partitions.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**
   - This function transforms a subarray into a "staircase" where the elements are 0, 1, 2, ..., i.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired "staircase" form.
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting the elements to the MEX value and appending the operations to the result.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` ensures that the maximum sum is computed correctly.
   - The recursive construction in `func_2` ensures that the operations are generated correctly to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The `make_stairs` function correctly transforms the subarray into the desired form and appends the operations.

However, there are a few issues in the provided code:

- **Global Variables:**
  - `arr` and `res` are used as global variables, which can lead to issues in function calls and state management.
  - It is better to pass these variables as arguments to the functions to ensure they are properly scoped and managed.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX calculation is not explicitly shown in the code. The function `func_1` and `func_2` assume that the MEX is correctly computed, but this is not clear from the provided code.
  - The MEX calculation should be implemented and used in the functions to ensure the correctness of the operations.

- **Staircase Transformation:**
  - The `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented. It should transform the subarray into a "staircase" where the elements are 0, 1, 2, ..., i, but the current implementation does not achieve this.
  - The function should correctly set the elements to the MEX value and append the operations to the result.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with global variables and the MEX calculation, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
