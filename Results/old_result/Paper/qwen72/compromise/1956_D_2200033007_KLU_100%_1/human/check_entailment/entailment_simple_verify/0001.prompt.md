You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that selects a subarray and sets all elements in the subarray to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**
   - This function computes the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where the maximum sum is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
   - For larger subarrays, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different partitions and the MEX of the subarray.
   - The function returns the maximum sum for the given subarray.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It first computes the maximum value for the subarray using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the corresponding operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" and appends the operation to the result.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the partition that achieves the maximum value and constructs the operations for those partitions.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**
   - This function transforms a subarray into a "staircase" where the elements are 0, 1, 2, ..., i.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired "staircase" form.
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting the elements to the MEX value and appending the operations to the result.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` ensures that the maximum sum is computed correctly.
   - The recursive construction in `func_2` ensures that the operations are generated correctly to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The `make_stairs` function correctly transforms the subarray into the desired form and appends the operations.

However, there are a few issues in the provided code:

- **Global Variables:**
  - `arr` and `res` are used as global variables, which can lead to issues in function calls and state management.
  - It is better to pass these variables as arguments to the functions to ensure they are properly scoped and managed.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The MEX calculation is not explicitly shown in the code. The function `func_1` and `func_2` assume that the MEX is correctly computed, but this is not clear from the provided code.
  - The MEX calculation should be implemented and used in the functions to ensure the correctness of the operations.

- **Staircase Transformation:**
  - The `make_stairs` function is not correctly implemented. It should transform the subarray into a "staircase" where the elements are 0, 1, 2, ..., i, but the current implementation does not achieve this.
  - The function should correctly set the elements to the MEX value and append the operations to the result.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with global variables and the MEX calculation, the provided program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
