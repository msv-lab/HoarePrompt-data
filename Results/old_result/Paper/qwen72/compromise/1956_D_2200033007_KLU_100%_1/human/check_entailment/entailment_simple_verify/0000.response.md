### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing the MEX operation on subarrays and then setting all elements in that subarray to the MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - **State Before Function Call**: `start_index` and `end_index` are valid indices within the array `arr`.
   - **Base Case**: If `start_index` equals `end_index`, the function returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]`. This is correct because the MEX of a single-element array is either 0 or 1, and setting it to 1 maximizes the sum.
   - **Recursive Case**: The function calculates `res` as the maximum value among several possible operations:
     - `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2`: This is incorrect because it does not represent the MEX operation. The MEX of a segment is not related to the square of its length.
     - `func_1(start_index, i - 1) + func_1(i + 1, end_index) + arr[i]`: This is also incorrect because it does not consider the MEX of the segment from `start_index` to `end_index`.
     - `arr[start_index] + func_1(start_index + 1, end_index)`: This is incorrect for the same reason.
     - `arr[end_index] + func_1(start_index, end_index - 1)`: This is incorrect for the same reason.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the maximum value among these incorrect calculations, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - **State Before Function Call**: `start_index` and `end_index` are valid indices within the array `arr`.
   - **Base Case**: If the length of the segment is 1:
     - If `arr[start_index]` is greater than 0, it returns an empty list. This is correct because no operation is needed.
     - Otherwise, it returns a list containing a single tuple `(start_index, start_index)`. This is correct because the MEX of a single-element array `[0]` is 1, and setting it to 1 maximizes the sum.
   - **Recursive Case**: The function checks if the maximum value `max_value` is equal to the square of the length of the segment. This is incorrect because the MEX of a segment is not related to the square of its length.
   - **Loop**: The loop iterates over possible split points `i` and checks if the sum of the results of the recursive calls plus `arr[i]` equals `max_value`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the MEX of the segment.
   - **Return Value**: The function returns the result of the recursive calls that match `max_value`, which is based on incorrect logic.

4. **Analysis of `make_stairs`**:
   - **State Before Function Call**: `i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is the array, `start_index` is a valid index, and `res` is a list of operations.
   - **Base Case**: If `i` is 0, it sets `arr[start_index]` to 1 and appends the operation to `res`. This is correct for a single-element segment.
   - **Recursive Case**: The function checks if the subarray from `start_index` to `start_index + i` is already a "staircase" (i.e., `arr[start_index + j] == j` for all `j` in the range). If not, it recursively calls `make_stairs(i - 1)` and then sets all elements in the subarray to `i`. This is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. The MEX value for a segment is not necessarily `i`.

5. **Specific Case Analysis**:
   - **Input**: `3\n0 2 1`
   - **Expected Output**: `6 1\n1 3`
   - **Actual Output**: The program will not produce the correct output because the logic in `func_1` and `make_stairs` is flawed.
   - **Explanation**: The correct MEX of the segment `[0, 2, 1]` is 3. Setting all elements to 3 results in the array `[3, 3, 3]` with a sum of 9. However, the program's logic does not correctly compute the MEX or handle the updates to the array.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing the specified operations. The issues in `func_1` and `make_stairs` are significant and lead to incorrect results.

**Final: False**
