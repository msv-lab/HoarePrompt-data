You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

Example

Input

    7
    
    12
    
    1
    
    2
    
    3
    
    1434
    
    2024
    
    200000

Output

    51
    1
    3
    6
    18465
    28170
    4600002

- Program:
soma = 0
N = int(input())
for _ in range(N):
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        soma += func_1(i)
print(soma)

def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` where 1 <= n <= 200000 and returns the sum of its digits. After the function concludes, the input integer `n` remains unchanged, and the returned value is the sum of the digits of `n`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line of input contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains a single integer \( n \) for which the sum of the digit sums must be calculated. However, the program reads an integer \( N \) and then iterates \( N \) times, reading a new \( n \) each time, but it only prints the sum of the digit sums for the last test case. This means that the output for the first \( N-1 \) test cases is not printed, which violates the problem's requirement to output the sum for each test case.

Additionally, the program calculates the sum of digit sums from 0 to \( n-1 \) instead of from 1 to \( n \). This is incorrect because the problem specifies that Vladislav writes the integers from 1 to \( n \) on the board, not from 0 to \( n-1 \).

To correct the program, it should:
1. Read the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterate \( t \) times.
2. For each test case, calculate the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( n \).
3. Print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    return sum(sum(int(d) for d in str(i)) for i in range(1, n + 1))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    result = sum_of_digit_sums(n)
    print(result)
```
