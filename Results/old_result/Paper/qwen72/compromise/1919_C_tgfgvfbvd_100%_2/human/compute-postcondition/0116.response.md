Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `l` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `x` is `n - 1`.

2. **After the Loop**:
   - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
   - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (if it exists).
   - `c` is the count of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet is `print(c)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Determine `a` and `b`**:
  - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
  - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (if it exists). If the list has fewer than 2 unique elements, `b` might not be defined, but for the purpose of this task, we assume the list has at least 2 unique elements.

- **Determine `c`**:
  - `c` is the count of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.
  - This means `c` will be the number of elements in `l` that are greater than the smallest and the second smallest elements.

### Example Scenarios:

- **Scenario 1**:
  - If `l = [5, 3, 8, 2, 7]`, then:
    - `a` (smallest) = 2
    - `b` (second smallest) = 3
    - Elements greater than both 2 and 3 are 5, 8, and 7.
    - Therefore, `c` = 3.
  - Output: **3**

- **Scenario 2**:
  - If `l = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, then:
    - `a` (smallest) = 1
    - `b` (second smallest) = 1 (since all elements are the same)
    - There are no elements greater than both 1 and 1.
    - Therefore, `c` = 0.
  - Output: **0**

- **Scenario 3**:
  - If `l = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`, then:
    - `a` (smallest) = 10
    - `b` (second smallest) = 20
    - Elements greater than both 10 and 20 are 30, 40, and 50.
    - Therefore, `c` = 3.
  - Output: **3**

### General Case:

- **General Description**:
  - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
  - `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (if it exists).
  - `c` is the count of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.

- **Output**:
  - The value of `c` will be the number of elements in the list `l` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements.

### Final Output:

Output: **c (where c is the count of integers in the list `l` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest elements)**
