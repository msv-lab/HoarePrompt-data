The code snippet `c += 1` increments the value of `c` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that `c` remains unchanged unless `a` > `b`, and the code snippet does not modify `a` or `b`, the value of `c` is incremented by 1 regardless of the condition.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, `a` is set to `l[1]`, `b` remains unchanged, `c` is increased by 1.**
