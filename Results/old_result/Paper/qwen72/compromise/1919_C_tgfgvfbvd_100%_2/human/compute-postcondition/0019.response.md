The only objects in the loop head are the variables `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x` relative to `n`. If `x` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 0 and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. For the next iteration, `x` will be incremented by 1, so `x` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, and `a` and `b` are updated based on the value of `l[0]` as described.**
