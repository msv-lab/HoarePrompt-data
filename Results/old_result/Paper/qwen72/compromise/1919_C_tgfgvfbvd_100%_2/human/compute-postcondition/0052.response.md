Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `l[0]`, and `c` is 0. The element `l[0]` is greater than the previous value of `a`. The current value of `l[0]` is less than or equal to the current value of `b`.**
