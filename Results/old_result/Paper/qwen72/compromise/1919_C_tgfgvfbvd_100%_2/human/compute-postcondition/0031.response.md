Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, `a` is equal to `l[2]`, `b` retains its original value, `c` remains unchanged. If `a` > `b`, `a` and `b` have swapped their values, and `c` is increased by 1 if `l[1]` > `a` and `a` > `b` did not cause a swap. Otherwise, `a` and `b` retain their original values, and `c` remains unchanged.**
