Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n-1`, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `b` is the second smallest integer in the list `l` (or `a` if all elements are the same), and `c` is the number of elements in `l` that are greater than both `a` and `b`.** 

The value of `n` is updated to the new input integer, which is greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
