Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 1, `x` is 0, and `l[x]` is greater than `a` and `l[x]` is greater than `b`.** 

The value of `c` is incremented by 1, so `c` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
