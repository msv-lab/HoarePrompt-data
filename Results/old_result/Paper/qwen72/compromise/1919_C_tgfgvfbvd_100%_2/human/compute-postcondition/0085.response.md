Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 0 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, `c` is 0, `x` is 0, and `a` is equal to `b`.**

Explanation: The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, but since both were initially `float('inf')`, they remain `float('inf')` after the swap. The condition that `a` is greater than `b` is no longer valid, as they are now equal. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
