### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each cell in the grid can be part of two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to color cells that cover the maximum number of diagonals.

3. **Solution Approach:**
   - If \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \), it means we need to cover all diagonals. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is \( n \) (since each row and each column must have at least one colored cell to cover all diagonals).
   - For other values of \( k \), we can use the fact that each cell covers two diagonals. Therefore, the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the code prints \( n \) (since \( k // 2 + 1 = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \), but this is incorrect. It should print \( n \)).
   - For other values of \( k \), the code correctly prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

### Conclusion:
The code is incorrect for the case where \( k = 4n - 2 \). It should print \( n \) instead of \( k // 2 + 1 \).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
