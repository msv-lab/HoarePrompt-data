You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
from math import ceil

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))



- Annotated Code: 
from math import ceil

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if 4 * n - 2 == k:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        else:
            print(ceil(k / 2))
        
    #State: The function `func` remains incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop iterates `t` times, each time reading two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and prints the result of the condition check. After the loop, the values of `n` and `k` are the last values read from the input, and `t` is unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each cell in the grid can be part of two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
   - To minimize the number of colored cells, we should try to color cells that cover the maximum number of diagonals.

3. **Solution Approach:**
   - If \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \), it means we need to cover all diagonals. In this case, the minimum number of cells required is \( n \) (since each row and each column must have at least one colored cell to cover all diagonals).
   - For other values of \( k \), we can use the fact that each cell covers two diagonals. Therefore, the minimum number of cells required is \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - For \( k = 4n - 2 \), the code prints \( n \) (since \( k // 2 + 1 = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \), but this is incorrect. It should print \( n \)).
   - For other values of \( k \), the code correctly prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

### Conclusion:
The code is incorrect for the case where \( k = 4n - 2 \). It should print \( n \) instead of \( k // 2 + 1 \).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
