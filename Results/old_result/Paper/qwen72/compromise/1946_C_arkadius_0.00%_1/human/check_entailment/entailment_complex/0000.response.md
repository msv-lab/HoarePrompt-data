Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The `Tree` class and `TreeNode` class are designed to handle the construction of the tree and the calculation of subtree sizes.
   - The `add_edge` method correctly adds edges to the tree.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method correctly roots the tree at a given vertex and calculates the subtree sizes for each vertex. This is crucial for the subsequent functions to work correctly.

2. **Good Components Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function is designed to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a given vertex `s` with a minimum component size `x`.
   - The function uses a stack to perform a depth-first search (DFS) in a non-recursive manner, which is appropriate given the potential size of the tree (up to 100,000 vertices).

3. **Recursive Good Components Calculation:**
   - The `func_2` function is a recursive version of `func_1` and is used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a given vertex `v` with a minimum component size `x`.
   - This function is not directly used in the main logic but is provided for reference. It is consistent with the logic of `func_1`.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size:**
   - The `func_3` function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`.
   - The function uses `func_1` to determine the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
   - It correctly returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.

5. **Finding the Maximum Component Size:**
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from the tree and each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`.
   - The binary search is correctly implemented, and the function returns the largest possible value of `x` that satisfies the conditions.

6. **Input Handling and Main Logic:**
   - The `func_5` function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to find and print the maximum component size.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and processes the input as described in the problem statement.

However, there is a discrepancy in the description of `func_5`:
- The comment in `func_5` states that it prints the "number of nodes at distance k from the root node," but the actual implementation of `func_5` prints the maximum component size `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and each remaining component has a size of at least `x`.

Given this, the implementation of `func_5` is correct for the problem described, but the comment is incorrect. Since the problem description and the actual implementation match, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
