### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges from a tree with `n` vertices, ensuring that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The solution involves a binary search to find the maximum `x` and a tree traversal to count the number of good components and their remaining sizes.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program is structured into several functions:
     - `func_1`: Non-recursive tree traversal to count good components and remaining sizes.
     - `func_2`: Recursive tree traversal to count good components and remaining sizes (used for verification).
     - `func_3`: Checks if a given `x` is a valid solution.
     - `func_4`: Binary search to find the maximum `x`.
     - `func_5`: Main function to read input and call the other functions.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The function uses a stack to perform a depth-first traversal of the tree.
     - It correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The function returns the total number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at the starting vertex `s`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function is a recursive version of the tree traversal.
     - It also correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` for each vertex.
     - The function is used to verify the correctness of `func_1`.

   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function checks if a given `x` is a valid solution by calling `func_1`.
     - It returns `True` if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
     - The logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

   - **`func_4`**:
     - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`.
     - The binary search is correctly implemented, and it narrows down the range until it finds the maximum valid `x`.

   - **`func_5`**:
     - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.
     - It handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and processing each one.
     - The tree is correctly rooted, and the binary search is performed to find the maximum `x`.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read correctly, and the tree is constructed using the provided edges.
   - The output is printed for each test case as required.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0 (no edges are removed) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the tree is a single vertex (n = 1) correctly.

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the maximum `x`, which is an efficient approach for this problem.
   - The tree traversal functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly count the good components and remaining sizes.
   - The validation function (`func_3`) correctly checks if the given `x` is a valid solution.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem, handles input and output as specified, and uses efficient algorithms to find the maximum `x`.

Final: **True**
