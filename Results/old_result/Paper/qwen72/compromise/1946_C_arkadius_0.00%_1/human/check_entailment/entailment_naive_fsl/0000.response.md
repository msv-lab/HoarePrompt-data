Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical issue in the `func_3` function. Specifically, the condition `if good_components > k:` is not correct. According to the problem description, we need to ensure that after removing exactly `k` edges, the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`. The condition `if good_components > k:` does not account for the fact that we need to remove exactly `k` edges, not more than `k` edges.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
5 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5
```
The tree looks like this:
```
  1
 / \
2   3
   / \
  4   5
```
If we remove the edge between 1 and 3, we get two components:
- Component 1: {1, 2} (size 2)
- Component 2: {3, 4, 5} (size 3)

Both components have a size of at least 2, so the answer should be 2. However, the program will incorrectly return 1 because it does not handle the case where `good_components` is greater than `k` correctly.

### Correct Condition:
The correct condition in `func_3` should be:
```python
if good_components == k and remaining_size >= x:
    return True
return False
```
This ensures that we only return `True` if the number of good components is exactly `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`.
