The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `tree`, `v`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree structure with `n` vertices. `v` is an integer representing a vertex in the tree. `x` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges.

The function returns the total number of good components found in all the subtrees of `tree.vertices[v].children` plus the number of subtrees whose remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of the sizes of all subtrees whose remaining size is less than `x` plus 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `v` representing a vertex, and a non-negative integer `x`. It returns the total count of good components in the subtrees of `v` plus the number of subtrees with a size of at least `x`, and the sum of the sizes of all subtrees with a size less than `x` plus 1.**
