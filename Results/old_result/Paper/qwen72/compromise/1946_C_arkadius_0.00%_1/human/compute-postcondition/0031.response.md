Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `v` is a vertex in the tree that has processed all its children, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `stack` is an empty list, and `postorder` is `True`. For each child `u` of `v`, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is less than `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` is increased by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the vertex `v` in the tree has processed all of its children. The `good_components` of `v` have been updated to include the `good_components` of each child `u` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`, plus an additional 1 for each child `u` whose `remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` of `v` has been updated to include the `remaining_size` of each child `u` whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`. The variables `s`, `x`, `stack`, and `postorder` remain unchanged.
