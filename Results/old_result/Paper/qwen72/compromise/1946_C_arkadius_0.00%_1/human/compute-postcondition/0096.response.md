Output State: **The program returns the total number of good components rooted at vertex `s` and the remaining size of vertex `s`. The `good_components` value for `s` is the total number of subtrees where the remaining size of each child is less than `x` or the child itself is a good component. The `remaining_size` of `s` is the sum of the remaining sizes of all its children whose `remaining_size` is less than `x`.**
