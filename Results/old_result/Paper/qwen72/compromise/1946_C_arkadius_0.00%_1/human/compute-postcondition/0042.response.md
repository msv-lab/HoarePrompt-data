Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is the second element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `v` is the first element of the tuple popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with the tuple `(v, True)` and `(u, False)` appended to it for each child `u` of `v`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have all its children processed by the loop.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `tree` object remains unchanged, and the `s` and `x` variables also remain the same as they were in the initial state. The `postorder` and `v` variables are still the second and first elements of the tuple popped from the `stack`, respectively. The `stack` now contains the tuple `(v, True)` followed by tuples `(u, False)` for each child `u` of the vertex `v`. The loop has processed all the children of the vertex `v`, meaning that all children of `v` have been appended to the `stack` as `(u, False)`.
