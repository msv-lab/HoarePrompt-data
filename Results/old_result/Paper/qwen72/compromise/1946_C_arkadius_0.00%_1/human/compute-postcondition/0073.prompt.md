Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple, and the tuple `(v, True)` has been appended to `stack`.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple and the tuple `(v, True)` has been appended to `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, and the tuple `(u, False)` has been appended to `stack`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple and the tuple `(v, True)` has been appended to `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two children, and the tuple `(u, False)` has been appended to `stack`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with two less tuples and the tuples `(v, True)` and `(u, False)` have been appended to `stack`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one more child.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
