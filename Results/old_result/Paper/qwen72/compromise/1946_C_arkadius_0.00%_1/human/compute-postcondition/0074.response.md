Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object with vertices and edges properly defined, `s` is a non-negative integer representing a vertex in the tree, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x <= n, `postorder` is updated to the second element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, `v` is updated to the first element of the tuple that was popped from `stack`, and `stack` is a list with at least one tuple remaining, but now with one less tuple. If `postorder` is empty, all the children of the current `v` are appended to `stack` in the form `(u, False)`, and the tuple `(v, True)` is appended to `stack` for each vertex `v` that was processed.***
