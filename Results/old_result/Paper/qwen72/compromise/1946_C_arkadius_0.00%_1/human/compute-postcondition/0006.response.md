Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is an integer read from the input, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as its argument, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and an edge has been added between `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` instance.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `[u, v] = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `u` and `v`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged.
- The `tree` instance and the edge added between `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` instance are still valid.
- The new values of `u` and `v` are the integers read from the input.
