The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer read from the input, `tree` is an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` as its argument, `u` and `v` are integers read from the input, and an edge has been added between `u - 1` and `v - 1` in the `tree` instance.**
