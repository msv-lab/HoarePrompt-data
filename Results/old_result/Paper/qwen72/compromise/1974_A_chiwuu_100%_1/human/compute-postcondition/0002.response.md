Output State: **For each test case, `t` is updated based on the input values `a` and `b` such that it is the minimum number of 15-minute intervals required to satisfy the condition `t * 15 >= a + b * 4`. The value of `t` for each test case is printed. The initial value of `t` and the input values `a` and `b` for each test case are not retained after the loop completes.**
