The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0 and the step size (2) allows `i` to iterate from 0 up to, but not including, `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2 (since the step size is 2).

State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `p` is a list of `n` zeros, `ind` is equal to `n`**
