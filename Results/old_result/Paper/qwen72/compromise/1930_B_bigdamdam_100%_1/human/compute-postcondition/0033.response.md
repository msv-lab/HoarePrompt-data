The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, and `p[i]` is now equal to `ind - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 2.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Since `i` is incremented by 2, the new value of `i` will be `i + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 2`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `p[i]` is now equal to `ind - 2`, `i` is 2**
