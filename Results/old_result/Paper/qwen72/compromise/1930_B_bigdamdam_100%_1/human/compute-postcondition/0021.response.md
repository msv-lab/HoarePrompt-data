The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop increments `i` by 2 starting from 1, and it will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `i` is 3

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 to 5, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (which is now 5) for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5**
