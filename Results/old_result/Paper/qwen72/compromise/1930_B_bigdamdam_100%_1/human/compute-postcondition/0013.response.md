Output State: **`n` is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `n` is even or `n - 1` if `n` is odd, `p` is a list where every even-indexed element (starting from 0) is filled with values decreasing by 2 starting from `n` down to `n - (n // 2) * 2`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to `n - (n // 2) * 2 - 2`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`**: The initial value of `n` remains unchanged. It is the first integer from the input and must be greater than 0.
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `n` if `n` is even, or `n - 1` if `n` is odd. This is because the loop increments `i` by 2 each time, and it stops when `i` reaches `n` (if `n` is even) or `n - 1` (if `n` is odd).
- **`p`**: The list `p` will have its even-indexed elements (starting from index 0) filled with values. The first even-indexed element (`p[0]`) will be `n`, the next (`p[2]`) will be `n - 2`, and so on, until the last even-indexed element, which will be `n - (n // 2) * 2`. All other elements in the list will remain 0.
- **`ind`**: After the loop finishes, `ind` will be equal to `n - (n // 2) * 2 - 2`. This is because `ind` is decremented by 2 for each iteration, and the loop runs for `n // 2` iterations (if `n` is even) or `(n // 2) + 1` iterations (if `n` is odd). Therefore, `ind` will be `n - (n // 2) * 2 - 2` after the loop completes.
