Output State: **`n` must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, `p[1]` is set to `ind`, `p[3]` is set to `ind + 2`, `ind` is increased by 4, `p[5]` is set to `ind`**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is increased by 2, so the new value of `ind` is `ind + 4` (since it was already increased by 2 in the initial state). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
