The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` will be incremented by 2, so `i` will be 4
- `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to continue

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`i` is 4, `n` must be greater than 4, `p[0]` is `ind - 4`, `p[2]` is `ind - 2`, `ind` is `ind - 2`**
