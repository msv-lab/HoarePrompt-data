The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, the problem statement mentions a parameter `n` with constraints such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. Since `n` is not a parameter of the function, it must be a predefined or global variable. The function returns a value based on the value of `n`.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on a predefined integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. The specific return value is not provided in the problem statement, so the exact functionality cannot be fully described.**
