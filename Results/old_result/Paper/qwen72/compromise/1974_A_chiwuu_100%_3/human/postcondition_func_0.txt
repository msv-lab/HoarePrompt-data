The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes two integers `a` and `b` such that 0 <= a, b <= 99. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of 15-minute intervals (`t`) required to ensure that the value `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is at least `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.
