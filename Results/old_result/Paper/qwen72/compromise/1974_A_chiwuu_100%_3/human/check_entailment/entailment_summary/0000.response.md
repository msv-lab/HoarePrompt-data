Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of screens required to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on a 5x3 grid. However, the program has a few issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons by dividing `b` by 2 and adding 1 if `b` is odd. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the grid has 15 cells per screen. The correct approach should be to calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons by dividing `b` by the maximum number of 2x2 icons that can fit on a screen, which is 3 (since 3 * 4 = 12 cells, and 15 - 12 = 3 cells are left for 1x1 icons).

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Space**:
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This is incorrect because it assumes that `t` is the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons, but it should be the total number of screens required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The correct approach should be to calculate the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons and then determine how many 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining space.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program then calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons by dividing `t2` by 15 and adding 1 if `t2` is not a multiple of 15. This is incorrect because it should consider the remaining space on the already allocated screens before adding new screens.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Calculate the Number of Screens for 2x2 Icons**:
   - Each screen can fit 3 2x2 icons (12 cells), so the number of screens required for `b` 2x2 icons is `b // 3` (integer division) plus 1 if there are any remaining 2x2 icons (`b % 3 > 0`).

2. **Calculate the Remaining Space on These Screens**:
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the remaining space on these screens can be calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. **Place the 1x1 Icons**:
   - Place as many 1x1 icons as possible in the remaining space. If there are still 1x1 icons left, calculate the number of additional screens required.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3
        
        # Calculate the remaining space on these screens
        remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons
        if remaining_space >= a:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        else:
            remaining_1x1 = a - remaining_space
            additional_screens = (remaining_1x1 + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        
        print(total_screens)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- ** screens_for_2x2 = (b + 2) // 3 **: This calculates the number of screens required to fit all 2x2 icons. The expression `(b + 2) // 3` ensures that if `b` is not a multiple of 3, it rounds up to the next whole number.
- ** remaining_space = screens_for_2x2 * 15 - b * 4 **: This calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
- ** if remaining_space >= a **: If the remaining space is enough to fit all 1x1 icons, no additional screens are needed.
- ** remaining_1x1 = a - remaining_space **: This calculates the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
- ** additional_screens = (remaining_1x1 + 14) // 15 **: This calculates the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons using ceiling division.
- ** total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens **: This gives the total number of screens required.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected program should be used to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
