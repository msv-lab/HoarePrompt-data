You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes two integers `a` and `b` such that 0 <= a, b <= 99. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of 15-minute intervals (`t`) required to ensure that the value `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is at least `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons (b) is such that it requires a full screen but does not completely fill it, and the remaining space is insufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons (a). For example, consider the input `1 4`. According to the program, it would calculate:

- `t = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 is even, it should be 2, but the program incorrectly adds 1)
- `t1 = 3 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 45 - 16 = 29`
- `t2 = 1 - 29 = -28` (which is incorrect because `t2` cannot be negative)

The program then incorrectly adds more screens to `t`, leading to an incorrect result. The correct number of screens for this case should be 2, as the 2x2 icons can be placed on one screen, and the 1x1 icon can be placed on the remaining space of the same screen. The program fails to handle this edge case correctly.
