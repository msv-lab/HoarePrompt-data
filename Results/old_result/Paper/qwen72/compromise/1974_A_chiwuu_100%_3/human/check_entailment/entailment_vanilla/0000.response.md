### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3), the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is determined by `t = b // 2 + (b % 2 != 0)`. This is because:
     - `b // 2` gives the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons.
     - If there is a remainder (`b % 2 != 0`), an additional screen is needed.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), the total number of screens `t` remains the same.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`.
   - The number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons is `t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 != 0)`. This is because:
     - `t2 // 15` gives the number of full screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - If there is a remainder (`t2 % 15 != 0`), an additional screen is needed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can hold at most 3 (15 / 4) 2x2 icons, and the program correctly accounts for the remainder.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is also correct. The program ensures that all 1x1 icons are placed, even if they require an additional screen.

### Edge Cases:

- **Zero Icons**: If both `a` and `b` are zero, the program correctly outputs 0 screens.
- **Only 1x1 Icons**: If `b` is zero, the program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `a` 1x1 icons.
- **Only 2x2 Icons**: If `a` is zero, the program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `b` 2x2 icons.
- **Mixed Icons**: The program correctly handles cases where both 1x1 and 2x2 icons are present, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle all the given test cases and edge cases. The logic and calculations are sound and follow the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
