Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons (b) is such that it requires a full screen but does not completely fill it, and the remaining space is insufficient to accommodate the 1x1 icons (a). For example, consider the input `1 4`. According to the program, it would calculate:

- `t = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 is even, it should be 2, but the program incorrectly adds 1)
- `t1 = 3 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 45 - 16 = 29`
- `t2 = 1 - 29 = -28` (which is incorrect because `t2` cannot be negative)

The program then incorrectly adds more screens to `t`, leading to an incorrect result. The correct number of screens for this case should be 2, as the 2x2 icons can be placed on one screen, and the 1x1 icon can be placed on the remaining space of the same screen. The program fails to handle this edge case correctly.
