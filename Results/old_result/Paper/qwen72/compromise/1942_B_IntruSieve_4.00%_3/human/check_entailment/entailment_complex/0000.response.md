Reasoning:  
The program aims to construct a permutation `p` based on the given array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program processes the array `a` to build a list `mex` which should represent the permutation `p`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mex` is initialized as an empty list.
   - `minn` and `maxx` are both initialized to 0.

2. **Processing the Array**:
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, it sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and updates `maxx` if this value is greater than the current `maxx`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline.

### Analysis:
- **Positive Elements in `a`**:
  - When `arr[i]` is positive, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This ensures that the smallest unused integer is added to `mex`.
  - If `minn` equals `maxx`, it sets `minn` to `maxx + 1`, which is a way to ensure that `minn` does not repeat any value already in `mex`.

- **Non-Positive Elements in `a`**:
  - When `arr[i]` is non-positive, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is intended to handle cases where the MEX value is greater than the current `p_i`.
  - The program updates `maxx` if the new value is greater than the current `maxx`.

### Issues:
- **Handling of Non-Positive Elements**:
  - The logic for handling non-positive elements in `arr` is not entirely correct. The expression `abs(arr[i] - minn)` does not necessarily give the correct MEX value. The MEX value should be the smallest non-negative integer not in the current prefix of `p`, and the value `p_i` should be derived from this MEX value and `a_i`.

- **MEX Calculation**:
  - The program does not explicitly calculate the MEX of the current prefix of `p`. Instead, it relies on the values of `minn` and `maxx`, which may not always correctly represent the MEX.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Specifically, the handling of non-positive elements and the MEX calculation are flawed.

Correctness: **False**
