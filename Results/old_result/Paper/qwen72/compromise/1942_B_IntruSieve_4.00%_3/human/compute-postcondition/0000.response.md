Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and an array `a` of length `n` with elements `a_i` (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data. `n` is an input integer.**
