Output State: `n` remains the same input integer, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `mex` is a list of integers that has been populated based on the conditions inside the loop, `minn` is the final value after all iterations, and `maxx` is the maximum value encountered in the loop.

To break it down:
- `n` is unchanged.
- `arr` is unchanged.
- `mex` will contain the values appended during the loop execution.
- `minn` will be the final value after all iterations, which could be different from the initial value of 0.
- `maxx` will be the maximum value encountered in the loop, which could be different from the initial value of 0.
