Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
4
3
2 2 2
5
1 2 1 2 1
1
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
1
-1
3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
-1
1
-1
1
```

The program incorrectly outputs `1` for the fourth test case, where the correct output should be `3`. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the minimum number of elements to remove. It does not properly account for the fact that the array is already beautiful and needs to be checked for the minimum removals to make it non-beautiful. The program's logic for updating `minn` and `same` is not correctly capturing the required conditions.
