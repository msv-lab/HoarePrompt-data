You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

                num = ar[i]

- Annotated Code: 
from math import inf

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input and output through standard output, as it does not have any parameters defined. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by a line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a in each test case is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        same = 1

        i = 1
        
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        
        minn = min(minn, same)
        
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
        
    #State: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration and has been incremented by `t` times, `n` is the input integer from the last test case, `ar` is a list of integers from the last test case with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `num` is the last element of `ar` that was processed, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements equal to `num`, and `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in all the test cases. If `minn` is `inf`, it indicates that there were no sequences of consecutive same numbers in any of the test cases. Otherwise, `minn` is the smallest length of such sequences found across all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it is no longer beautiful.
   - An array is beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) where \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It initializes a variable `same` to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same.
   - It also initializes `minn` to infinity to keep track of the minimum length of consecutive same elements.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive same elements.
   - If the minimum length of consecutive same elements is infinity, it means all elements are the same, and the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements. In this case, it prints -1.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive same elements.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful.
   - The logic for finding the minimum length of consecutive same elements is flawed. It does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The program does not check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. It only checks the minimum length of consecutive same elements, which is not sufficient.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, we need to check if there are any elements that can be removed to break the pattern of making all elements the same.
   - If the array has only one unique element, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and we should print -1.
   - If the array has more than one unique element, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no operation can make all elements the same.

5. **Correcting the Program:**
   - We need to count the number of unique elements in the array.
   - If there is only one unique element, print -1.
   - Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern. This can be done by checking the length of the longest subarray of consecutive same elements and ensuring that removing one element from this subarray will make the array non-beautiful.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful and does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only checks the minimum length of consecutive same elements, which is not sufficient to determine the correct answer.
