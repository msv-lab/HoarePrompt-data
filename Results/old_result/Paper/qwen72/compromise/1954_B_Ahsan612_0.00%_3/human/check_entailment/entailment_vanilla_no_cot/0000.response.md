Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same, but this is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The problem requires ensuring that no operation can make all elements the same, which involves more complex logic than just finding the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

2. **Handling of Beautiful Arrays**: The program does not properly handle the condition where the array is already beautiful and needs to be made non-beautiful. It simply finds the minimum length of consecutive identical elements and prints that, which is not the correct solution.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the array has only one element or when all elements are the same.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

- Identify if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
- Check if the array is already non-beautiful.
- If all elements are the same, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, so the output should be -1.
- Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no operation can make all elements the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Check if the array is already non-beautiful
        if n <= 2:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful
        min_remove = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                min_remove = min(min_remove, 1)
            else:
                min_remove = min(min_remove, 0)
        
        if min_remove == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_remove)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program:

- Checks if all elements are the same and prints -1 if they are.
- Handles the case where the array has fewer than 3 elements.
- Finds the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure the array cannot be made beautiful by any operation.
