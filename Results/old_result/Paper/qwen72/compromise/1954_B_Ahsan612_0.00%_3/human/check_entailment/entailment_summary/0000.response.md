Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by identifying the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. The program iterates through each test case, and for each array, it tries to find the shortest sequence of consecutive identical elements. The logic is based on the idea that if you can find a sequence of consecutive identical elements, removing one element from the shortest such sequence will prevent the array from being beautiful.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Consecutive Sequences**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop to iterate through the array and counts the length of consecutive sequences of the same number.
   - The condition `if ar[i] == num:` is used to check if the current element is the same as the previous one.
   - If the current element is different, the program increments `i` and updates `num` to the next element, which is incorrect because it skips the current element without checking the sequence length.
   - The program should correctly identify sequences of the same number and count their lengths.

2. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one element by printing `-1` (since a single-element array cannot be made non-beautiful).

3. **Handling of Identical Arrays**:
   - The program correctly identifies that if all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, and it prints `-1`.

4. **Incorrect Minimum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same number, but it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already non-beautiful.
   - The program should check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements from the shortest sequence of identical elements.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the array is already non-beautiful or where the array has alternating elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
