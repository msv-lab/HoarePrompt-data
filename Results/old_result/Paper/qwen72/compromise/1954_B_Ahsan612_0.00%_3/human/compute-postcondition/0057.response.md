The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than the length of the list `ar`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must still be less than the length of `ar`. Since `ar` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is currently 2, `ar` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `num` is equal to the first element of `ar`, `i` is 2. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num`, `same` is 2 and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, and `num` is updated to the value at index 1 of `ar`.**
