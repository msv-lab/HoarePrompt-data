Based on the initial state provided:

- `_` is incremented by the number of iterations, but its value is not relevant to the print statement.
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
- `num` is the last element of `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in `ar` and `same`.
- `same` is the length of the last sequence of consecutive same numbers in `ar`.
- The current value of `minn` is `inf`, indicating that there are no sequences of consecutive same numbers in `ar`.

The print statement is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This statement simply prints the integer `-1`. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this print statement.

Output: **-1**
