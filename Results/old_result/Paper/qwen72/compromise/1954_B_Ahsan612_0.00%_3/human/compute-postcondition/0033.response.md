Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements found in `ar`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `ar` to find sequences of consecutive equal elements.
- After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to the length of `ar`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the list.
- `same` will hold the count of the last sequence of consecutive equal elements in `ar`.
- `minn` will hold the minimum length of any sequence of consecutive equal elements found in `ar`. If all elements are unique, `minn` will be 1. If there are sequences of equal elements, `minn` will be the length of the shortest such sequence.
