Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least four elements, `i` is 5, `len(ar)` is greater than 4, `same` is 1, `num` is the sixth element of `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`.** 

The value of `same` is now explicitly set to 1, and since `minn` is the minimum of 1 and `same`, `minn` is also 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
