Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case to find the minimum length of consecutive sequences of the same number in the list, and prints this minimum length to standard output for each test case. If no such sequences exist in a test case, it prints `-1`. The function does not return any value and modifies no external state. **
