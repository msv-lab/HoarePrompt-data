Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `minn` is 1, `num` is equal to the element at index `i` of `ar`, `i` is 2, and the element at index `i` of `ar` is not equal to the previous value of `num`.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` from its initial state, which was already 1. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
