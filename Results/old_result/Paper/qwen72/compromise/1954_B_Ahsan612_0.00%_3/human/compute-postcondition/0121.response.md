The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from standard input, where the input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), indicating the number of test cases. Each test case starts with a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by a line containing `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array `a` in each test case is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function processes each test case and outputs the result to standard output.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It processes each test case and outputs the result to standard output.**
