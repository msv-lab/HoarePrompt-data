The value of `same` is incremented by 1. The other conditions and variable values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is a temporary variable used for iteration, `n` is the input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5, `minn` is now equal to the minimum of its previous value and 1. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `same` is 3 or 4, and `num` is equal to the first element of `ar` or the element at index `i` in `ar`. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 4 or 5, `same` is 2, and `num` is equal to the element at index `i` in `ar`.
