Output State: **The input value is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is the new input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1. If `minn` was `inf`, then `minn` is now 1. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and 1.**
