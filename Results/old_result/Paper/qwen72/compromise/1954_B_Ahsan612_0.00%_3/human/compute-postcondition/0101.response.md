The value of `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value (1) and the value of `same` (which can be either 1 or 2 based on the initial state). Since `minn` is already 1, the minimum value between 1 and `same` will always be 1. Therefore, `minn` remains 1.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least four elements.
- `i` is 4.
- If `ar[1]` is equal to `num` (which is the first element of `ar`), `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1.
- `num` is updated to `ar[4]`.
- The second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.

Output State: **`_` is incremented by 1, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least four elements, `i` is 4, if `ar[1]` is equal to `num` (which is the first element of `ar`), `same` is 2. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to `ar[4]`, `minn` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**
