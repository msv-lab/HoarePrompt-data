Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are lists that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body. If `x` > `y`, then: if `y` (the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty) is greater than or equal to `lit[2]`, `y` is updated to `lit[2]` (if `b` is not empty). If `lit[2]` is greater than `x` (the last element of `a` or infinity if `a` is empty), `y` is updated to `lit[2]` (if `b` is not empty). If `lit[2]` is greater than `y` but not greater than `x`, then `lit[2]` is appended to `a`. If neither condition is met, `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `x` ≤ `y`, then: if `x` == `y`, `a` is modified to include the element `lit[2]` at the end, and `x` is the last element of `a`. If `x` < `y`, then: if `x` ≥ `lit[2]`, `a` includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, and `x` is the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[2]` if `a` was not empty before). If `x` < `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `y`, `a` includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, `x` is the last element of `a` (which is now `lit[2]` if `a` was previously empty, or the last element of `a` before the new addition if `a` was not empty), and `y` retains its previous value. If `y` ≥ `lit[2]` and `lit[2]` > `x`, `b` includes the element `lit[2]` at the end, `x` retains its previous value, and `y` is the last element of `b` (which is now `lit[2]` if `b` was previously empty, or the last element of `b` before the new addition if `b` was not empty). Otherwise, if `x` is not less than `y`, the lists `a` and `b` and the values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
