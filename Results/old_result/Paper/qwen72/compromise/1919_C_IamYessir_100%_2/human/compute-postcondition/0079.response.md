Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is a list that has been modified by appending `lit[2]` to it, `b` is a list that may have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `x` is either infinity (if `a` is empty) or the last element of `a` (if `a` is not empty). If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**

The value of `a` has been updated by appending the third element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[2]`) to it. The other variables remain unchanged. If `a` was previously empty, it now contains `lit[2]`, and `x` is now equal to `lit[2]`. If `a` was not empty, `x` is still the last element of `a`, but `a` now has an additional element. The value of `y` remains the same, as it is determined by the last element of `b` (if `b` is not empty) or is infinity (if `b` is empty).
