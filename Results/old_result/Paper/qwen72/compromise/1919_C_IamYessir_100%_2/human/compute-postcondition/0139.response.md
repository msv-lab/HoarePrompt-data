Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list containing the element `lit[i]`, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element, `y` is the last element of `b` (which is `lit[i]`), `x` is the last element of `a` (if `a` is not empty) or infinity (if `a` is empty), the current value of `x` is greater than the current value of `y`, the current value of `y` is less than the current value of `lit[i]`, the current value of `lit[i]` is greater than the current value of `x`.**
