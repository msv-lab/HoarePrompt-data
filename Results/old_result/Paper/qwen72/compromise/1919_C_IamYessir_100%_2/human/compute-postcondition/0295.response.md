Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element. If `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`, `b` now contains the second element of `lit`, and if `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `y` is less than `lit[i]`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `x`, `b` now contains the first element of `lit` (i.e., `lit[1]`), and if `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b` (i.e., `lit[1]`). If `lit[i]` is not greater than `x`, and `lit[i]` is greater than `y`, then `a` now contains the second element of `lit`. If `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to positive infinity. If `a` is not empty, `x` is the last element of `a`.***
