Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `s` is 0, `a` and `b` are lists that have been populated based on the conditions within the loop. If `a` is empty, `x` is infinity; otherwise, `x` is the last element of `a`. If `b` is empty, `y` is infinity; otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`.**
