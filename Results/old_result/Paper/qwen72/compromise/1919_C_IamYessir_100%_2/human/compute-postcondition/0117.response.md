To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is equal to `t`.
   - `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body.
   - `cp` is 0.
   - `i` is `len(b) - 1`.
   - `b` must have at least 2 elements.
   - `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` and `n` are the same integer.
   - `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, but its exact values are not specified.
   - `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified, but the exact modifications are not specified.
   - `cp` is a counter initialized to 0.
   - `i` is the index of the last element in `b`.
   - `b` is a list with at least 2 elements.
   - `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

3. **Determine the Value of `s`:**
   - `s` is calculated by iterating through the list `b` and counting the number of elements that are greater than the element immediately before them.
   - Since the exact values of `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`.
   - However, we know that `s` is the count of such elements in `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(s)` statement will print the value of `s`, which is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

Output: **s (where s is the count of elements in b that are greater than their preceding element)**
