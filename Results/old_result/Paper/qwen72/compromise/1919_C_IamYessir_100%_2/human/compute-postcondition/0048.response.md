Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `x` is set to infinity, `y` is set to infinity if `b` is an empty list, otherwise `y` is the last element of `b`.** 

The value of `x` is set to infinity, and the other variables remain unchanged. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is also set to infinity. If `b` is a non-empty list, `y` is the last element of `b`.
