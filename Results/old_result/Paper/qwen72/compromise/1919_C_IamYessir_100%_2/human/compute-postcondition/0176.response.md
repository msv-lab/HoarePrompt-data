Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `lit[i] > x`, `b` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]`, and `y` is the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[0]`. If `lit[i] <= x`, `a` is a list with the first element being `lit[0]` if `lit[0] > y`, and `x` is set to `lit[0]`. If `lit[0] <= y`, `a` remains an empty list, and `x` is set to infinity.***
