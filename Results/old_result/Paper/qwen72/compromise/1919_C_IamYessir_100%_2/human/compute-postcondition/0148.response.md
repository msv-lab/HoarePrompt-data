Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `b` is an empty list, `y` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `y` is the last element of `b`. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`. Additionally, `x` is less than or equal to `y`, and the current values of `x` and `y` are equal. `a` now contains the last element of `lit` appended to it.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the last element of `lit` (since `i` is -1) to the list `a`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `lit`, `b`, `cp`, `i`, `s`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The new state of `a` includes the last element of `lit` appended to it.
