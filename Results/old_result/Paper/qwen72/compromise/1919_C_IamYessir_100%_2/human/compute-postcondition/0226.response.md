Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element, plus 1. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`.**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, reflecting that an additional condition where an element in `a` is greater than its previous element has been met. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
