Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is an empty list, `b` is an empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.**

The lists `a` and `b` are reset to empty lists, and since `b` is now empty, `i` which was initially `len(b) - 1` is now -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
