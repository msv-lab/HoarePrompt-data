Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a non-empty list, `cp` is 0, `i` is -1, `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `a` is an empty list, `x` is set to infinity. Otherwise, `x` is set to the last element of `a`.***
