Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is 2, and `s` is 2 if the third element of `a` is greater than the second element of `a`. Otherwise, `s` is 1 if the second element of `a` is greater than the first element of `a`, and `s` remains 0 otherwise.***
