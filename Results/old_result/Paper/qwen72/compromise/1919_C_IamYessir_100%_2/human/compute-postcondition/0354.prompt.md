Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(0, n):
        if len(a) == 0:
            x = float('inf')
        else:
            x = a[-1]
        if len(b) == 0:
            y = float('inf')
        else:
            y = b[-1]
        if x > y:
            if y >= lit[i]:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
            elif x >= lit[i] and lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
        elif x == y:
            a.append(lit[i])
        elif x < y:
            if x >= lit[i]:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif lit[i] > y:
                a.append(lit[i])
            elif y >= lit[i] and lit[i] > x:
                b.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is equal to `t`, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` and `b` are lists that have been modified based on the conditions in the loop body, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `b` must have at least 2 elements. `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the new input integer, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `b` is a list with at least 2 elements, `x` is the last element of `a`, `y` is the last element of `b`, and `s` is the number of times an element in `a` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus the number of times an element in `b` was greater than its preceding element from index 1 to `len(b) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
