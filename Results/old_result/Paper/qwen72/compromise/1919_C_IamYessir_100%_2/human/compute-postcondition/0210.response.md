Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 1, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a list, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is the count of elements in `b` that are greater than their preceding element. If `x` (the last element of `a` or infinity if `a` is empty) is greater than `y` (the last element of `b` or infinity if `b` is empty), then: if `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, `y` is set to `lit[1]`, and `s` is updated accordingly; if `y` is less than `lit[1]` and `lit[1] > x`, `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, and `y` is set to `lit[1]`; if `y` is less than `lit[1]` and `lit[1] <= x` and `lit[1] > y`, `a` includes `lit[1]`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`; if `y` is less than `lit[1]` and `lit[1] <= x` and `lit[1] <= y`, `a` and `x` remain unchanged. If `x` is less than or equal to `y`, then: if `x` is equal to `y`, the second element of `lit` is appended to `a`, and `x` is set to the last element of `a`; if `x` is less than `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, then `lit[1]` is appended to `a`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`; if `x` is less than `y` and `lit[1]` is greater than `y`, then `lit[1]` is appended to `a`, and `x` is set to `lit[1]`; if `x` is less than `y` and `lit[1]` is greater than `x` and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[1]`, then `lit[1]` is appended to `b`, and `y` is set to `lit[1]`.***
