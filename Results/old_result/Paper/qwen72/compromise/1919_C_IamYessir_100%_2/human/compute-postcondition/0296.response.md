The code `a.append(lit[i])` adds the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `a`.

- `a` is updated by appending the element `lit[1]` to it.
- `i` remains 1.
- `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `lit` remains a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cp` remains 0.
- `s` remains the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element.
- If `b` is empty, `y` remains set to positive infinity.
- If `b` is not empty, `y` remains the last element of `b`.
- If `a` is not empty, `x` is now the last element of `a`, which is `lit[1]`.
- If `a` was empty before, `x` is now set to `lit[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element, `a` is updated by appending `lit[1]` to it, if `b` is empty, `y` is set to positive infinity, if `b` is not empty, `y` is the last element of `b`, if `a` was empty, `x` is now `lit[1]`, if `a` was not empty, `x` is now the last element of `a` which is `lit[1]`.**
