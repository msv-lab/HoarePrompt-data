The code `b.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` of the list `lit` to the list `b`. 

- The value of `lit[i]` is added to the list `b`.
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `y` is updated to the last element of `b`, which is now `lit[i]`.
- The value of `x` remains greater than the new value of `y`.
- The value of `t` remains an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- The value of `n` remains greater than 0.
- The value of `cp` remains 0.
- The value of `s` remains the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element.
- The list `lit` remains unchanged.
- The list `b` now has one more element, which is `lit[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is greater than 0, `lit` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cp` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the number of times an element in `b` is greater than its previous element, starting from the second element up to the last element, `b` is a non-empty list with the last element being `lit[i]`, `y` is `lit[i]`, `x` is greater than `y`, and `y` is greater than or equal to `lit[i]`.**
