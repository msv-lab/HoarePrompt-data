### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices, from which \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most \( n \) queries.
   - Each query asks for a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).

2. **Interaction Protocol:**
   - The query format is `"? d"`, and the response is a pair of integers \((v, u)\).
   - If no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found, the response is \((0, 0)\).
   - If a vertex \( v \) is found, it is removed from the graph along with all its edges.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to \( n \).
   - It enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
   - Inside the loop, it iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
   - For each degree \( d \), it makes a query to find a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).
   - If \( v \) is found and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it adds \( v \) to the `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
   - The loop ensures that the program continues to find and remove vertices until all vertices are processed.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly handles the query responses and updates the `path` and `remaining_vertices` accordingly.
   - By starting with the highest degree and working down, the algorithm ensures that it finds a vertex with the minimum degree that meets the criteria.
   - The removal of vertices and edges is done correctly, and the program ensures that it does not exceed the \( n \) query limit.
   - The final path is printed in the correct format, and the output is flushed to ensure proper interaction with the judge.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no vertex with a degree at least \( d \) is found by continuing to the next degree.
   - It also handles the case where the graph is fully processed and `remaining_vertices` is empty by breaking out of the loop and printing the path.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The algorithm makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit.
   - The time complexity is \( O(n^2) \) in the worst case, but this is acceptable given the constraints.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - This function is responsible for making the query and reading the response.
  - It correctly prints the query in the format `"? d"` and reads the response as two integers \((v, u)\).
  - The function returns these two integers, which are used by `func_2` to update the state of the program.
  - **Annotation Accuracy:** The annotations correctly describe the function's behavior and state transitions.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - This function initializes the `path` list and the `remaining_vertices` set.
  - It enters a loop that continues until `remaining_vertices` is empty.
  - The loop iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n-1 \) down to 0.
  - For each degree \( d \), it calls `func_1` to get a vertex \( v \) with a degree at least \( d \) and another vertex \( u \) not connected to \( v \).
  - If \( v \) is found and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it adds \( v \) to the `path` and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
  - The loop ensures that the program continues to find and remove vertices until all vertices are processed.
  - **Annotation Accuracy:** The annotations correctly describe the function's behavior and state transitions.

- **Overall Program Behavior:**
  - The program correctly handles the interaction protocol and ensures that it does not exceed the \( n \) query limit.
  - The program constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively finding and removing vertices with the minimum degree that meets the criteria.
  - The final path is printed in the correct format, and the output is flushed to ensure proper interaction with the judge.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the allowed number of queries. The logic and interaction with the judge are handled appropriately.
