The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. If `remaining_vertices` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_vertices` is a set that no longer includes the vertex added to `path` (if any). For the loop to execute one more time, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is -1, `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, and `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex**
