Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list that includes at most one vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and the current value of `v` is 0. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**
