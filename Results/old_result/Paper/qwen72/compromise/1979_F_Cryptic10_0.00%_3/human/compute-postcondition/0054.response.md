Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, `path` now includes `v` and at most one other vertex from the initial `remaining_vertices` set. `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`, and `remaining_vertices` must still contain at least one vertex. If `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement. If `v` is not 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement.**
