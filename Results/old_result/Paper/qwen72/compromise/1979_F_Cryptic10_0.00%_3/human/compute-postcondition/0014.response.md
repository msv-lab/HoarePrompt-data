Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 2`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, `remaining_vertices` no longer includes the current value of `v`, and `path` is a list that now includes the current value of `v`. If `v` is not in `remaining_vertices`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(d)`.
- The value of `n` remains an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
- The value of `d` remains `n - 2`.
- The conditions for `v` and the actions based on `v`'s value are still valid and unchanged.
