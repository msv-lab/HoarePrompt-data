Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is a list that includes all vertices from the initial `remaining_vertices` set, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

### Natural Language Description:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains unchanged, still being an integer within the range 2 to 10^5. The `path` list will contain all the vertices that were initially in the `remaining_vertices` set, meaning that each vertex from 1 to `n` has been added to the `path` list exactly once. The `remaining_vertices` set will be empty, as all vertices have been removed from it and added to the `path` list. The loop terminates when there are no more vertices left in `remaining_vertices`.
