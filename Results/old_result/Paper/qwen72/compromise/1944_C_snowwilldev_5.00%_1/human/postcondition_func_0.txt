The function `func` reads input for multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`. It then iterates through the list `a` and prints the first index `i` where the count of `i` is 1 and the count of any previous index was 1, or where the count of `i` is 0. If no such index is found, the function implicitly ends the test case without printing anything. The function does not return any value.
