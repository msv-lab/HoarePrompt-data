You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program: 
from collections import defaultdict

def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        t = 0
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break



- Annotated Code: 
from collections import defaultdict

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func():
    for tc in range(int(input())):
        N = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = defaultdict(int)
        
        for i in range(N):
            cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
        t = 0
        
        for i in range(N):
            if cnt[i] == 1:
                t += 1
            if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
                print(i)
                break
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is the number of times `cnt[i]` was 1 during the loop, and the loop has printed the value of `i` if `t` became greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` was 0 at any point during the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game's optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal moves for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
0 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
In this case, the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob would be:
1. Alice picks 0. Now, `a = [1, 2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
2. Bob picks 1. Now, `a = [2, 3]` and `c = [0]`.
3. Alice picks 2. Now, `a = [3]` and `c = [0, 2]`.
4. Bob picks 3. Now, `a = []` and `c = [0, 2]`.

The MEX of `c = [0, 2]` is 1, which is the expected output. However, the program outputs 0, which is incorrect.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game's optimal strategy. It simply counts the number of unique elements and prints the first index where the count is less than 2, which does not align with the game's rules and objectives.
