Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem by determining the final score of the game based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. Here's a breakdown of how the program works and why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Counting Elements**: For each test case, it reads the array `a` and uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array.
3. **Determining the MEX**:
   - It initializes a variable `t` to 0, which will be used to count the number of elements that have exactly one occurrence.
   - It iterates through the range from 0 to `N-1` (where `N` is the size of the array).
   - For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `cnt[i]` (the count of `i` in the array) is 1. If it is, it increments `t`.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, it prints `i` and breaks out of the loop. This is because:
     - If `t` reaches 2, it means there are two elements that appear exactly once, and Alice can choose one of them, leaving Bob with the other. The MEX of the resulting array `c` will be `i` because `i` is the smallest integer that does not appear in `c`.
     - If `cnt[i]` is 0, it means `i` is the smallest integer that does not appear in the array `a` at all, and thus the MEX of `c` will be `i`.

This logic ensures that the program correctly finds the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The program efficiently handles the constraints and produces the correct output for each test case.
