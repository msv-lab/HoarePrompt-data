Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `N` is greater than 2, and `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is set to 2 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `t` remains 1 and the program continues without breaking.***
