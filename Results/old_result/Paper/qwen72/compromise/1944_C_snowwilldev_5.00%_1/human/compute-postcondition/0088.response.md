Postcondition: ***`N` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is set to 1; otherwise, `t` remains 0.***
