Output State: **`N` is the value of `int(input())`, `i` is `N-1`, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state variables `N`, `i`, `cnt[a[j]]`, and `tc` remain unchanged, but the list `a` is now populated with the integers from the input.
- The condition that `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())` remains valid.
- The output state includes the updated value of `a` and retains the initial state information that is still valid.
