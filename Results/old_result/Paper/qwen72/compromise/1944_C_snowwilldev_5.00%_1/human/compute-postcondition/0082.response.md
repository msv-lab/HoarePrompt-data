Postcondition: **`N` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is a defaultdict initialized with int, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `tc` is incremented by 1, `tc` must be less than the value returned by `int(input())`, `a` is a list of integers. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is set to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0. The current value of `t` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2, and `cnt[i]` is 0.**
