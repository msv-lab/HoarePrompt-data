Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, `tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of `n` integers, but after this code, `a` is updated to the list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `tc`, `N`) remain unchanged.
