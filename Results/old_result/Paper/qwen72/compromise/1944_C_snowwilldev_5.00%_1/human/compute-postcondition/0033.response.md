The only object in the loop head is the variable `tc`. The loop iterates based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases. At the end of the previous iteration, `tc` has a value that is one less than the total number of test cases. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is `N-1`, `N` remains the same, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`, `t` is the number of indices `i` for which `cnt[i] == 1` up to the point where `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, `tc` is incremented by 1**
