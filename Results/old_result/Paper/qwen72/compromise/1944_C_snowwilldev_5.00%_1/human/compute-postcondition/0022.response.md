Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `N` is greater than 1, `cnt[a[j]]` is incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range 0 to `N-1`. If `cnt[i]` is 1, `t` is set to 2. If `t` is at least 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `t` remains 1 and the program continues without breaking.***
