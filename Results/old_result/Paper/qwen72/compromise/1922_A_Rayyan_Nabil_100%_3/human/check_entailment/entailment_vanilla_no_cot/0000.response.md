Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` checks if there is any position where both `a` and `b` differ from `c`, but it does not ensure that `a` and `b` match the same template while `c` does not. Specifically, the program lacks the logic to construct and validate a template that meets the conditions for `a` and `b` to match and `c` to not match.

### Corrected Program:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that for each position `i`:
1. `a[i]` and `b[i]` must either be the same or different in a way that allows them to match the template.
2. `c[i]` must not match the template that `a[i]` and `b[i]` match.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_possible(n, a, b, c):
    # Create a template where 'L' means the character must be lowercase and 'U' means uppercase
    template = [''] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            if a[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
            template[i] = a[i].upper()
        else:
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                return 'NO'
            template[i] = 'U'
    
    # Check if c matches the template
    for i in range(n):
        if template[i] == c[i].upper():
            return 'NO'
    
    return 'YES'

def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(is_possible(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Template Construction**:
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]`.
   - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be any uppercase letter, and `c[i]` must not match this uppercase letter.

2. **Validation**:
   - After constructing the template, we check if `c` matches the template. If any character in `c` matches the corresponding uppercase character in the template, the template is invalid, and we return 'NO'.

3. **Output**:
   - If the template is valid and `c` does not match it, we return 'YES'.

This corrected program ensures that the conditions for the template are correctly checked and validated.
