You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(n, a, b, c):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State: The loop will either return 'YES' if there is at least one index i where both a[i] and b[i] are different from c[i], or it will not return anything (i.e., the function will continue executing or terminate normally) if no such index exists. The values of a, b, and c remain unchanged.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It checks if there is at least one index `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. If such an index is found, the function returns 'YES'. If no such index exists, the function returns 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_2():
    t = int(input().strip())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        results.append(func_1(n, a, b, c))
        
    #State: t is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 20, a, b, and c are strings of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `results` is a list containing t elements, each element being the result of the function `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The list `results` remains unchanged, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` also remain unchanged. The loop iterates through each element in `results` and prints it, but does not modify any of the variables.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then iterates `t` times, during each iteration reading an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 20` and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each iteration, it calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and appends the result to a list `results`. After all iterations, it prints each element in the `results` list. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `results` contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the corresponding iteration, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks if the characters in the same position of strings `a` and `b` are different from the corresponding character in string `c`. However, it does not ensure that the characters in `a` and `b` match the template conditions (lowercase letters must match exactly, and uppercase letters must not match their lowercase counterparts).

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
The program will return "YES" because `a[0] != c[0]`, `a[1] != c[1]`, and `a[2] != c[2]`. However, there is no template that can satisfy the conditions for both `a` and `b` while making `c` not match. For any template, if `a` and `b` match, `c` will also match, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
