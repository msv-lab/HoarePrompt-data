The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. It then iterates `t` times, during each iteration reading an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 20` and `a`, `b`, and `c` are strings of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. For each iteration, it calls `func_1(n, a, b, c)` and appends the result to a list `results`. After all iterations, it prints each element in the `results` list. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the list `results` contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, a, b, c)` for the corresponding iteration, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
