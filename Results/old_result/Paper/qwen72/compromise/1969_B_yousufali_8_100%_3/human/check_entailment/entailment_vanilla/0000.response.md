### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's).
   - We can perform cyclic shifts on any substring of the binary string.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve the sorted string.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - The function iterates over each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n` by 1.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that each time we encounter a '0' after a '1', we need to perform a cyclic shift to move the '1' to the right of the '0'.
   - The cost of each such shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - This is because we need to shift the entire substring from the first '1' to the current '0' to the right by one position.
   - The function correctly accumulates the total cost in `ans` and prints it.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's before all '1's), the function will correctly output 0.
   - If the string is all '1's or all '0's, the function will also correctly output 0.
   - For strings like "101011", the function will correctly compute the minimum cost.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function processes each character in the string exactly once, making it O(|s|) in complexity.
   - This is efficient enough given the constraints (sum of lengths of strings over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:
