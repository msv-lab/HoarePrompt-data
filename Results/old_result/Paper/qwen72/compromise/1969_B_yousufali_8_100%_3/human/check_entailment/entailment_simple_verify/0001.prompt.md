You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

#Function 1:

    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):

            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None, as the function does not take any parameters and directly reads input from the user.
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` is the same input string, `n` is the number of '1's in the string `s`, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in the string `s` that is not at the beginning of the string and is preceded by at least one '1'.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of n + 1 for each '0' in the string s that is not at the beginning of the string and is preceded by at least one '1', and n is the number of '1's in the string s)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases, and `t` must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on any chosen substring.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` reads a binary string `s` from input.
   - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to store the total cost.
   - It iterates through the string `s`:
     - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because each '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's requires a cyclic shift of the entire sequence of '1's plus the '0' to move the '0' to the correct position.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from input.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the cost of sorting the binary string by counting the number of '1's and the positions of '0's that need to be moved.
   - The cost calculation `n + 1` for each '0' that appears after a sequence of '1's is correct because it accounts for the length of the substring that needs to be cyclically shifted.
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case in `func_2`, ensuring that the solution is applied to all test cases.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") correctly by printing 0.
   - It also handles the case where the string is entirely '1's (e.g., "1111") correctly by printing 0 since no '0's are present to disrupt the order.
   - The function correctly handles the case where '0's and '1's are mixed (e.g., "11000", "101011").

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using the specified cyclic shift operation.

### Correctness:
**True**
