Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 or 3 depending on its initial value. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.***
