The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, and the loop control is based on the comparison of `tc` with `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `tc` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `tc` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `tc`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the condition holds as is. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the condition also holds as is.**
