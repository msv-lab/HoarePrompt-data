The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since the initial state specifies that if `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 or 3 depending on its initial value, but the given code snippet does not affect this condition directly. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `mexsize` by 1.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`, `mexsize` is `mexsize + 1`.**
