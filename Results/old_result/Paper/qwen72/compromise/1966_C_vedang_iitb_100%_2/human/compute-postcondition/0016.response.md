Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers from user input with at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`. If `sz` equals `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is incremented by 1 (resulting in either 4 if the second element was 1, or 2 otherwise). Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged (either 3 if the second element was 1, or 1 otherwise).***
