The only objects in the loop head are the variable `sz` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If there are more elements in `a`, the loop will execute again with the next element.

At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `sz` is the second element in the list `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least 3 elements, and `sz` will be the third element in the list `a`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the third element in the list `a`. If `sz` is equal to `mexsize`, then `mexsize` is updated to 2 or 3 depending on its initial value. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains unchanged.**
