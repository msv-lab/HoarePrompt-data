The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `tc` is 2
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers
- `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`
- If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the condition holds as is
- If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the condition also holds as is

After executing the code:
- The variable `a` is updated to a new list of integers based on the input provided.
- The values of `t`, `tc`, `n`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from the new input, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, the condition holds as is. If `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`, the condition also holds as is.**
