To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic of the statement:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers from the input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`).
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

4. **Determine the Value of `mexsize`:**
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `mexsize` is a positive integer and it is less than or equal to `maxsize`, it can be any integer from 1 up to `maxsize`.

5. **Odd or Even Check:**
   - The parity (odd or even nature) of `mexsize` depends on the specific values in the list `a`.
   - However, without the exact values of `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `mexsize` but we can determine its parity.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The output will be either 'Alice' or 'Bob' depending on whether `mexsize` is odd or even.
   - Since the exact value of `mexsize` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the condition.

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
