To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is `for i in range(0, n):`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable is initialized by the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run.

The other variables and objects (`s`, `A`, and `idx_A`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
- `n` is the length of `s`.
- `A` is an empty list.
- `idx_A` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized by the loop itself.

State: **`s` is a string of length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 5 · 10^5) consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` must be greater than 0, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
