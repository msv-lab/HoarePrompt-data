Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `B` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end of the string `s` up to the current index, adjusted by the distance between consecutive '<' characters and the number of '<' characters seen so far. `idx_A` remains unchanged, `idx_B` is a list of indices where each element is the index of a '<' character in the string `s`, in reverse order (from the end of the string to the start). `l` is 0.**
