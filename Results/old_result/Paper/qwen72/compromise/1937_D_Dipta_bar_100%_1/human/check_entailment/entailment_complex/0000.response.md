### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to process the string and print the results.

2. **Function `func_1` Overview:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` to compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, respectively, adjusted by their positions and the number of such characters seen so far.
   - It also uses two lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to store the indices of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Processing '>' Characters:**
   - The first loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each '>' character, it calculates the cumulative count and stores it in `A`.
   - It also stores the index of each '>' character in `idx_A`.

4. **Processing '<' Characters:**
   - The second loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each '<' character, it calculates the cumulative count and stores it in `B`.
   - It also stores the index of each '<' character in `idx_B`.

5. **Calculating the Time for Each Cell:**
   - The third loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each cell, it determines the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative counts and positions stored in `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`.
   - The calculations are complex and involve adjusting the cumulative counts based on the positions of the characters and the number of characters seen so far.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the time for each cell in the format specified in the problem description.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Initialization and Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
  - It correctly reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.

- **Cumulative Count Calculation:**
  - The cumulative counts in `A` and `B` are calculated correctly based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.
  - The indices of these characters are stored correctly in `idx_A` and `idx_B`.

- **Time Calculation:**
  - The time calculation for each cell is based on the cumulative counts and positions stored in `A`, `B`, `idx_A`, and `idx_B`.
  - The logic for adjusting the cumulative counts and positions is complex but appears to be correct based on the problem description.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the string `s` consists entirely of '>' or '<' characters.
  - It correctly prints the time for each cell in the specified format.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The cumulative counts and time calculations are consistent with the rules provided for the pinball movement.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
