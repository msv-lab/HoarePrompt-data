### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on a cell moves left or right based on the character in the cell and inverts the character after moving.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each placing a pinball on a different cell and calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we read the length `n` and the string `s` of length `n`.
   - The output should be `n` integers, each representing the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid when placed on the corresponding cell.

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to precompute the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from the left and right sides, respectively.
   - `A` is computed by iterating from left to right and keeping track of the positions of '>' characters.
   - `B` is computed by iterating from right to left and keeping track of the positions of '<' characters.
   - For each cell, the program calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid by combining the precomputed values from `A` and `B`.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Precompute `A`:**
     - Iterate from left to right.
     - If the current character is '>', calculate the number of steps required to reach the next '>' character and add it to the `A` array.
     - Keep track of the positions of '>' characters in `idx_A`.

   - **Precompute `B`:**
     - Iterate from right to left.
     - If the current character is '<', calculate the number of steps required to reach the next '<' character and add it to the `B` array.
     - Keep track of the positions of '<' characters in `idx_B`.

   - **Answer Queries:**
     - For each cell, determine the direction of the pinball.
     - Use the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the total time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - The calculations involve combining the steps from `A` and `B` and adjusting for the current position and the number of steps required to invert the characters.

5. **Verification:**
   - **Precomputation of `A` and `B`:**
     - The precomputation steps for `A` and `B` are correct and follow the rules of the problem.
     - `A` correctly calculates the cumulative steps required to move to the next '>' character.
     - `B` correctly calculates the cumulative steps required to move to the next '<' character.

   - **Query Answering:**
     - The logic for calculating the time for each cell is complex but follows the rules of the problem.
     - The program correctly handles edge cases where there are no '>' or '<' characters in the grid.
     - The calculations for each cell are based on the precomputed values in `A` and `B`, and the program adjusts for the current position and the number of steps required to invert the characters.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The precomputation steps for `A` and `B` are both O(n).
   - The query answering step is also O(n).
   - The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Final Evaluation:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The precomputation and query answering steps are well thought out and handle the problem constraints effectively. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
