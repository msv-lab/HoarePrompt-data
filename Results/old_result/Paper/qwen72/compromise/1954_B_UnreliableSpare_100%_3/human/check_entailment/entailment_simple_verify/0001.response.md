Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are the same, the array will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed, so the program correctly outputs `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that will be updated by any valid count.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element `val`.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - After the loop, it ensures `ans` is updated with the count of the last segment of consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` if the array is not all the same, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array has only one element correctly by outputting `-1` (since a single-element array is trivially beautiful and cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a single pass through the array to determine the minimum number of elements to remove, making it efficient with a time complexity of O(n).
   - However, the use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be simplified to `float('inf')` or `math.inf`, which are more efficient and appropriate for this context.

6. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers the segments of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `arr[0]`. This approach does not account for other possible segments of consecutive elements that could be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only consider the segments of `1`s and will output `1` (the minimum count of consecutive `1`s). However, removing any single `2` would also make the array non-beautiful, and the correct answer should be `1`.

7. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible segments of consecutive elements, not just those equal to the first element.
   - A more appropriate approach would be to find the minimum length of any segment of consecutive elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful. This can be done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the lengths of all segments of consecutive elements.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically incorrect because it does not consider all possible segments of consecutive elements that could be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Final: **False**
