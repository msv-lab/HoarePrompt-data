### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Management**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case using a for loop.
   - However, the function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, which is incorrect. The function should be called with the test case data.

2. **Checking for All Elements Being Equal**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are equal by iterating through the array and setting a flag `flag` to `False` if any element is different from the previous one.
   - This part of the logic is correct. If all elements are equal, the array is beautiful and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, so the program correctly prints `-1`.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of the array.
   - It initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` and then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are equal to the first element.
   - When it encounters a different element, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements found so far.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element.

4. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only considers consecutive elements that are equal to the first element, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can stop being beautiful.
   - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will only count the consecutive `1`s, but the correct approach should consider the structure of the array and the possibility of removing elements to break the beautiful property.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, we need to check if there are any elements that can be removed to break the condition where `a[i]` can be replaced by `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.
   - One way to do this is to find the longest subarray where all elements are the same and then determine if removing elements from this subarray can break the beautiful property.
   - If the array has only one unique value, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, and we should print `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is incorrect because it only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
