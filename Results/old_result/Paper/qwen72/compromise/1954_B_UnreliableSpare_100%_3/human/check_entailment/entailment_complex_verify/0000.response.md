### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Assessment Challenge**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program: it does not handle the case where the array length is 1. For an array of length 1, the output should be `-1` because it is impossible to make a single-element array non-beautiful by removing elements. However, the program does not check for this specific case and proceeds with the logic that assumes the array length is greater than 1.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the input.
   - It sets a flag `flag` to `True` and iterates through the array to check if all elements are the same. If it finds any two consecutive elements that are not equal, it sets `flag` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `flag` is `True` (i.e., all elements are the same), it prints `-1`.
   - If `flag` is `False` (i.e., there are at least two different consecutive elements), it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of `arr` and prints this count.

3. **Handling Array Length 1**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if `n` is 1. When `n` is 1, the loop `for i in range(1, n)` does not execute, and `flag` remains `True`. Therefore, the program prints `-1` for an array of length 1, which is the correct output according to the problem description.
   - However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the program outputs `1` for an array of length 1. This is a mistake in the assessment.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.
   - For arrays where not all elements are the same, the program calculates the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element and prints this count. This logic is correct for the problem's requirements.
   - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler integer value like `float('inf')` or a large integer, but it does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was inaccurate in stating that the program outputs `1` for an array of length 1. The program actually outputs `-1`, which is correct.
- The program correctly handles all other cases as described in the problem.

Final: **True**
