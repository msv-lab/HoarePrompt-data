### Reasoning:
The problem requires determining if it's possible for Nikita to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes in the tower after \( n \) moves, where each move can either add or remove exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. ** Moves**: Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
3. **Final State**: We need to check if it's possible to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

To achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves:
- If \( n \geq m \), it means Nikita has enough moves to potentially add \( m \) cubes.
- The difference \( n - m \) must be even because each move that adds a cube must be balanced by a move that removes a cube to maintain the final count of \( m \) cubes. If \( n - m \) is odd, it means there's an unbalanced number of moves, making it impossible to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes.

The program checks these conditions:
- `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach \( m \) cubes.
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even, allowing for balanced addition and removal of cubes.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic described above. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by reading \( n \) and \( m \), and prints "YES" if the conditions are met, otherwise "NO". The conditions are logically sound and cover all possible scenarios for the given problem constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
