Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining whether it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves and the final number of cubes.

1. **Initial Condition**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Move Analysis**:
   - Adding a cube increases the number of cubes by 1.
   - Removing a cube decreases the number of cubes by 1.
3. **Final Condition**: After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower should be `m`.

To achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves:
- The total number of moves `n` must be at least `m` because you can't have more cubes than the number of moves.
- The difference `(n - m)` must be even. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out, and the only way to end up with an exact number of cubes is if the remaining moves (after accounting for the `m` cubes added) are even.

The program checks these conditions:
- `n >= m` ensures that the number of moves is sufficient to reach `m` cubes.
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even.

The program correctly implements these conditions and prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program behaves as expected and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
