You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

                suma += x
                if (a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0 and i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), we can rewrite the condition as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)
     \]
     for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides both \(a\) and \(b\), let \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\).
   - Substituting these into the equation:
     \[
     d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     a' + b' = k \cdot d \cdot b'
     \]
     \[
     a' = b' \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a'\) to be an integer, \(b' \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\) must be an integer. Since \(\gcd(a', b') = 1\), \(b'\) must be 1. Therefore:
     \[
     a' = k \cdot d - 1
     \]
   - This means \(a = d \cdot (k \cdot d - 1)\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values using the formula:
     \[
     x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - It then checks if the expression \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) \mod i^2\) and \(i \cdot (i - 1) \mod i^2\) are both zero, and if so, adds 1 to the sum.
   - Finally, it prints the sum minus 2.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The formula \(x = \left\lfloor \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + 1\) is derived from the condition \(a = i \cdot (k \cdot i - 1)\), which is not correct. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     a = i \cdot (k \cdot i - 1)
     \]
     where \(k\) is an integer such that \(a \le n\).
   - The program incorrectly adds 1 to \(x\) and then checks for additional conditions that are not necessary.
   - The final subtraction of 2 is also incorrect and not justified by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
