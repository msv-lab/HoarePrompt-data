Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect for the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating over possible values of \(b\) and computing a value \(x\) which is supposed to represent the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b\). However, the formula used to compute \(x\) is incorrect.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not correctly checked in the program.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The program subtracts 2 from the final sum, which is not justified by the problem statement. This subtraction is likely incorrect and should be removed.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Valid Pairs**:
   - The logic inside the loop where it checks if \((a - i * (i - 1)) % i ** 2 == 0\) and \(i * (i - 1) % i ** 2 == 0\) is not relevant to the problem. The correct approach should involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
2. For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(x, y):
    return math.gcd(x, y)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
