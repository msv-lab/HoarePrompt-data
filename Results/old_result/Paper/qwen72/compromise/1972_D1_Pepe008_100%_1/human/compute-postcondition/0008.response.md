Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is `x`, `i` is 1, `x` is `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, and the value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` is `a`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `suma` is updated by adding `x` to it. Since `suma` was initially 0, `suma` now equals `x`.
- The value of `x` is calculated as `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, which simplifies to `(a - 0) // 1`, and thus `x` is equal to `a`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `((a - i * (i - 1)) // i` is also `a` because `i` is 1, and the expression simplifies to `(a - 1 * (1 - 1)) // 1`, which is `a`.
