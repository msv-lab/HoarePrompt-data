The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on `i` being less than or equal to `b`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `b` must still be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2**
