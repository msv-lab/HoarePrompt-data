Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `suma` is `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 + 1`, `i` is 3, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3`.** 

The value of `suma` is incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The new value of `suma` is the result of the expression `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 + 1`.
