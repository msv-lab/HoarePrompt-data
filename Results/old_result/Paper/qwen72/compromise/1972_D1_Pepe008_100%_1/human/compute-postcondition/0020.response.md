Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `suma` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is the result of the expression `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1`**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to `(a - 3 * (3 - 1)) // 3 ** 2 + 1`.
- Simplifying the expression: `(a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 1` which is `(a - 6) // 9 + 1`.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, and `i` remain unchanged.
