Reasoning:

The program aims to construct an array `a` such that `x_i = a_i mod a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. The approach taken in the function `func_1` is to initialize an array `ans` of length `n` with the maximum possible value (`10^9`) and then update the elements of `ans` from the end to the beginning based on the given `x_i` values.

However, there is a critical issue in the logic of `func_1`:

1. **Initialization of `ans`**: The array `ans` is initialized with `10^9` for all elements. This is not a problem in itself, but it sets the stage for the next issue.
2. **Update Logic**: The program updates `ans[i]` with `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` for each `i` from `n-2` to `0`. This logic is incorrect because:
   - The formula `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]` does not guarantee that `ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i]`.
   - For the modulo operation to work correctly, `ans[i + 1]` should be greater than or equal to `arr[i]` and `ans[i]` should be chosen such that the remainder of `ans[i + 1]` divided by `ans[i]` equals `arr[i]`.

To correct this, the program should instead set `ans[i]` to a value that ensures the modulo condition is satisfied. One simple way to do this is to set `ans[i]` to `arr[i] + 1` and `ans[i + 1]` to a multiple of `ans[i]` plus `arr[i]`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[-1] = arr[-1] + 1  # Initialize the last element
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        ans[i] = arr[i] + 1  # Set ans[i] to arr[i] + 1
        ans[i + 1] = ans[i] * (arr[i + 1] // ans[i + 1] + 1) + arr[i + 1]  # Ensure ans[i + 1] % ans[i] = arr[i + 1]
    return ans
```

Given the current implementation, the program will not always produce a correct array `a` that satisfies the conditions.

Correctness: **False**
