It seems there's a mismatch in the function definition provided for the problem. The problem description is about a game with multiple outcomes and betting strategies, while the function definition `def func_1(numbers):` does not match this context. However, based on the problem description, here is the correct precondition for the function that should be defined to solve this problem:

Function definition:
```
def distribute_coins(test_cases):
```

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. The first element of each tuple is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second element is a list of n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The length of the list of test cases is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
