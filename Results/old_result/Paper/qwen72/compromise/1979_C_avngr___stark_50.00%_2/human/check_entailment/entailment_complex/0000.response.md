### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to distribute coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received for a winning outcome is the bet on that outcome multiplied by the corresponding multiplier `k_i`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `m` and then computes the bet for each outcome as `m / k_i`.
   - It then finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the bets and divides each bet by this GCD to ensure the bets are as small as possible.
   - Finally, it checks if the sum of the bets is strictly less than the product of the multipliers divided by the GCD. If not, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The product `m` of all multipliers ensures that the bets are large enough to cover all multipliers.
   - Dividing each bet by the GCD ensures that the bets are minimized while still maintaining the required condition.
   - The check `if sum(c) >= m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - **Product Calculation:** The product `m` of all multipliers can become very large, potentially causing integer overflow. However, since the multipliers are between 2 and 20, and `n` is at most 50, the product `m` is manageable.
   - **GCD Calculation:** The GCD calculation is correct and ensures that the bets are minimized.
   - **Sum Check:** The sum check is necessary to ensure the condition is met. If the sum of the bets is not strictly less than the product divided by the GCD, the program correctly outputs `-1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Outcome:** If there is only one outcome, the program will correctly output `-1` because the sum of the bets (which is the bet itself) cannot be strictly less than the amount received.
   - **Equal Multipliers:** If all multipliers are the same, the program will correctly output `-1` because the sum of the bets will be equal to the amount received.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the correct logic and handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
