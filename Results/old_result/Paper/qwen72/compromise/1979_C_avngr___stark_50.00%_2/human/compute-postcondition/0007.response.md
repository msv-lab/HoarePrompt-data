Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the last element of `numbers` (if the list has more than one element), `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in `numbers`.**

This means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `hcf` variable will hold the greatest common divisor of all the integers in the `numbers` list. The `num` variable will be set to the last element of the `numbers` list if the list has more than one element. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
