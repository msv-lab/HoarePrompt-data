Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a test case. The first element of each tuple is an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50) representing the number of outcomes, and the second element is a list of `n` integers `k_1`, `k_2`, ..., `k_n` (2 ≤ `k_i` ≤ 20) representing the multipliers for each outcome. The length of the list of test cases is guaranteed to be between 1 and 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `hcf` is assigned the value of the first element in the list `numbers`.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers[1:]:
    hcf = gcd(hcf, num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first and second elements of `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `numbers`, `hcf` is the GCD of the first, second, and third elements of `numbers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`, `hcf` is the GCD of the first, second, third, and fourth elements of `numbers`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
