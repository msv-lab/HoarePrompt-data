The only objects in the loop head are the variables `num` and the list `numbers`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `numbers`. If `numbers` has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again for the fourth element. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` must have at least 3 elements, and `num` is the third element of `numbers`. For the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least 4 elements, and `num` will be the fourth element of `numbers`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `num` is the fourth element of `numbers`, `hcf` is the GCD of the first, second, and third elements of `numbers`.**
