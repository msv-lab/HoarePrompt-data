The only objects in the loop head are `num` and `numbers`. To ensure the loop can execute, `numbers` must have at least two elements, because the loop starts iterating from the second element (`numbers[1:]`).

- `num` will be the second element of `numbers` at the start of the first iteration.
- `numbers` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state, we need to adjust the state to reflect these conditions.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples as described, `numbers` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, `hcf` is the first element of `numbers`**
