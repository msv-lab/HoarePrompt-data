The function `solve` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the width of the grid, and two binary strings `a1` and `a2` of length `n` representing the values in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
