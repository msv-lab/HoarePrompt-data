Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 1)`, `best_y` is `x - 1`, `y` is `x - 1` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 1)`.**

The variable `best_y` is now assigned the value of `y`, which is `x - 1`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
