Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1 (or the smallest value greater than 0 that the loop reaches), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + 1` if `current_sum` > `max_sum`, otherwise `max_sum` remains unchanged, `best_y` is `y` if `current_sum` > `max_sum`, otherwise `best_y` remains unchanged.**
