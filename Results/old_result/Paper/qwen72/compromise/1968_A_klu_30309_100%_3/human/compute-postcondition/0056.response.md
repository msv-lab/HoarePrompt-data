Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is 0, and `best_y` is the value of `y` that produced this maximum `max_sum`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state is updated by setting `max_sum` to 0.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
- `t` is still a non-negative integer within the specified range.
- `test_cases` is still a list of integers with each integer within the specified range and having at least 3 elements.
- `x` is still the third element in `test_cases`.
- `results` is still a list containing `best_y`.
- `y` is still 1.
- `gcd_val` is still the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, which is 1.
- `current_sum` is still `gcd_val + 1`, which is 2.
- `max_sum` is now 0.
- `best_y` is still the value of `y` that produced the maximum `max_sum`, which is 1.
