Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases` and must be at least 2, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is `x - 2`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 2)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `max_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 2)`, `best_y` is `x - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
