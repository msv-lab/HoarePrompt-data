The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` and `x`. The loop decrements `y` by 1 in each iteration, starting from `x - 1` and ending at 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 2`, and `y` must be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

To execute one more time, `y` must be decremented by 1, so `y` will be `x - 3`. For the loop to continue, `y` must still be greater than 0, which means `x - 3 > 0` or `x > 3`.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list, `y` is `x - 3` and must be greater than 0, `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 3)` and `best_y` is set to `x - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
