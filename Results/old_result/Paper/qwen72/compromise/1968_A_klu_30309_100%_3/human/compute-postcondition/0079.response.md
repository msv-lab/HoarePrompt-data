Postcondition: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `test_cases`, `y` is `x - 3`, `gcd_val` is `math.gcd(x, x - 3)`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + (x - 3)`. If `current_sum` > `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `gcd_val + (x - 3)`, `best_y` is updated to `x - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `best_y` remain unchanged.**
