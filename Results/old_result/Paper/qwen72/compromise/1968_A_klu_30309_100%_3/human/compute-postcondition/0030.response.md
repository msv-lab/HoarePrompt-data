Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of integers where each integer x satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000 and must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing `best_y`, `y` is 1 (or the smallest value greater than 0 that the loop reaches), `gcd_val` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `1`, `current_sum` is `gcd_val + 1`, `max_sum` is 0, `best_y` is 1.**

Explanation:
- `best_y` is explicitly set to 1.
- The value of `gcd_val` is now the greatest common divisor of `x` and 1, which is always 1.
- `current_sum` is now `gcd_val + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
- Since `max_sum` is 0, `current_sum` (which is 2) is greater than `max_sum`.
- Therefore, `best_y` is updated to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
