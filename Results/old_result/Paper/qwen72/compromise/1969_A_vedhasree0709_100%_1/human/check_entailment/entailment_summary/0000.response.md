Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if there is any pair of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair is found, it prints `2` because inviting both friends in the pair will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. If no such pair is found, it prints `3` because in the worst case, Monocarp needs to invite 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them come to the party.

However, the program has a logical flaw. It only checks for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` if such a pair is found. If no such pair is found, it prints `3`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider other possible scenarios where fewer than 3 invitations can still ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. The program will print `3` because it does not find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends. However, the correct answer is `2` because inviting friends 1 and 2 will ensure that both friends 1 and 2 come to the party (since friend 2's best friend is friend 3, and friend 3's best friend is friend 4, and friend 4's best friend is friend 1).

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and is thus incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
