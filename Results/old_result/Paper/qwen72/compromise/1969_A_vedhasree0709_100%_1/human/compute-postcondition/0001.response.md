Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and p is a list of n integers where each p_i satisfies 1 <= p_i <= n and p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct. The loop has executed and printed either 2 or 3 for each iteration of the outer loop, depending on whether a specific condition was met.**
