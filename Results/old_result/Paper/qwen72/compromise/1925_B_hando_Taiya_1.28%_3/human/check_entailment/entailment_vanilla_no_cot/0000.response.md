Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads the values of `x` and `n` and initializes `ans` to 0.

3. **Loop for Divisors**: The loop iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` using `isqrt(x)`. This is efficient because it reduces the number of iterations compared to checking all numbers up to `x`.

4. **Checking Divisors**: For each divisor `i`:
   - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the maximum balance `ans` for each test case.

### Explanation of the Logic:
- The goal is to find the maximum GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems such that their sum is `x` and there are `n` sub-problems.
- The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties will be maximized if the difficulties are as evenly distributed as possible.
- The program checks all divisors of `x` and selects the largest divisor `i` such that `n` sub-problems can each have a difficulty of at least `i` or `x // i`.

### Example Test Cases:
- For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the possible divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The largest divisor `i` such that `n <= x // i` is 2 (since 3 <= 10 // 2 = 5). Hence, the output is 2.
- For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only possible divisor is 1. Since 5 <= 5 // 1 = 5, the output is 1.
- For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the possible divisors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420. The largest divisor `i` such that `n <= x // i` is 6 (since 69 <= 420 // 6 = 70). Hence, the output is 6.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance, and it handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
