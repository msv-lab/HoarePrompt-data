Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold `m` rounds, given the constraints and the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Problems**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of size 7 to keep track of the number of problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). It then iterates through the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. If the count of problems for a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it adds the difference to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program should produce the correct output for the given examples and any valid input within the specified constraints.
