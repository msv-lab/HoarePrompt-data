You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: `count` is a list of 7 integers where each integer represents the frequency of the corresponding character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.
    needed_problems = 0
    for i in range(7):
        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `needed_problems` is the total number of additional problems needed to make the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' at least `m`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `count` remains the same list of 7 integers.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns the total number of additional problems needed to make the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' at least `m`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `count` remains the same list of 7 integers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `a`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `m` is an integer between 1 and 5, and `a` is a string of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of additional problems needed to make the frequency of each character from 'A' to 'G' at least `m`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and `count` remains the same list of 7 integers.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
