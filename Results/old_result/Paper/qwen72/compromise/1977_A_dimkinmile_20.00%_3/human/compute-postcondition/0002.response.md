The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Yes'`. The initial state describes that `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, with the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 100, and that the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to the current value of `m`. However, the `print` statement does not depend on the values of `n` or `m` and simply prints a fixed string.

Output: **Yes**
