Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to determine if, after `n` moves, a tower can have exactly `m` cubes. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. The function simply checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and prints "Yes" if it is, and "No" otherwise. This logic is incorrect because it does not consider the nature of the moves (i.e., adding or removing a cube).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
- Each move can either add or remove a cube.
- After `n` moves, the number of cubes in the tower can be any integer from `n` to `-n` (if all moves are removals), but it must be possible to reach exactly `m` cubes.

The correct condition to check is whether `n` and `m` have the same parity (both are even or both are odd) and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. This is because:
- If `n` and `m` have different parities, it is impossible to reach `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- If `n` is less than `m`, it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves.

Given this, the correct logic should be:
```python
if (n >= m) and ((n - m) % 2 == 0):
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

However, the provided program does not implement this logic. It only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is insufficient.

Let's analyze the given test cases:
1. For `n = 3` and `m = 3`:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and `n - m = 0` (which is even).
   - The correct answer is "Yes".

2. For `n = 2` and `m = 4`:
   - `n` is less than `m`.
   - The correct answer is "No".

3. For `n = 5` and `m = 3`:
   - `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and `n - m = 2` (which is even).
   - The correct answer is "Yes".

The provided program would output:
- "Yes" for `n = 3` and `m = 3` (correct).
- "No" for `n = 2` and `m = 4` (correct).
- "Yes" for `n = 5` and `m = 3` (correct).

However, the program would incorrectly output "Yes" for cases where `n` is greater than or equal to `m` but they have different parities, such as `n = 4` and `m = 3`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
