Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

3. **Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` (the number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes in the tower).
   - If `n >= m`, it prints "Yes".
   - If `n < m`, it prints "No".

4. **Correctness of Logic**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic is incomplete. The program only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, but it does not consider the parity of `n - m`.
   - The problem requires that Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, and the tower starts with zero cubes. Therefore, to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, and starting from zero, an odd number of moves will always result in an odd number of cubes, and an even number of moves will always result in an even number of cubes.

5. **Missing Condition**:
   - The program does not check if the difference `n - m` is even. This is a critical oversight because if `n - m` is odd, it is impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - For example, if `n = 3` and `m = 2`, the program will print "Yes" because `n >= m`, but it is actually impossible to end up with exactly 2 cubes after 3 moves (since 3 - 2 = 1, which is odd).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect due to the missing parity check for `n - m`.

Final: **False**
