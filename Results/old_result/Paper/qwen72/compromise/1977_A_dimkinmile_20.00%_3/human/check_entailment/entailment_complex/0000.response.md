Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining if it's possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves. The program, however, only checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.

To solve the problem correctly, the following conditions must be met:
1. `n` must be at least `m` because Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move.
2. The number of moves `n` and the final number of cubes `m` must have the same parity (both even or both odd). This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and starting from 0 cubes, the parity of the number of cubes will always match the parity of the number of moves.

The given program does not consider the second condition. It will print "Yes" for any `n` that is greater than or equal to `m`, which is incorrect. For example, for the input `2 4`, the program will print "No" because `2` is not greater than or equal to `4`, but the correct answer should be "No" because it's impossible to have 4 cubes after 2 moves (the parity condition is not met).

Correctness: **False**
