The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the user. It expects the first input to be a non-negative integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` such that 2 <= x <= 1000. The function then calculates `x - 1` and prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the value of `x - 1` has been printed for each of these test cases. The function does not return any value.
