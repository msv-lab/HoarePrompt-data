Reasoning:  
The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order by cyclically shifting any chosen substring. The key to solving this problem is to understand that the cost is minimized by focusing on the transitions from '1' to '0' in the string, as these are the points where the string is not in the desired order.

The function `func_1` works as follows:
- It initializes `cost` to 0 and `one` to 0.
- It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
- If the character is '1', it increments the `one` counter.
- If the character is '0' and there are preceding '1's (`one > 0`), it increments the `cost` by `one + 1`.

This approach is based on the idea that each '0' that follows a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '0' to the left of all '1's. The cost of each such shift is the length of the substring being shifted, which is `one + 1` (the number of '1's plus the '0' itself).

However, there is a subtle issue with this approach. The function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of a more optimal solution where the entire string might be cyclically shifted to achieve the sorted order with a lower cost. Specifically, if the string has a pattern like `101010...`, the function will overestimate the cost because it will count each '0' as a separate shift, whereas a single cyclic shift of the entire string might be more efficient.

To verify, let's consider the test cases:
1. For the string "10", the function correctly identifies that a single shift of the entire string is needed, resulting in a cost of 2.
2. For the string "0000", the function correctly identifies that no shifts are needed, resulting in a cost of 0.
3. For the string "11000", the function correctly identifies that three shifts are needed, resulting in a cost of 9.
4. For the string "101011", the function correctly identifies that two shifts are needed, resulting in a cost of 5.
5. For the string "01101001", the function correctly identifies that the minimum cost is 11, but this might not be the optimal solution. A single cyclic shift of the entire string could achieve the sorted order with a cost of 8.

Given this, the function `func_1` does not always provide the minimum cost, especially for strings with multiple '10' transitions.

Correctness: **False**
