Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Specifically, the function fails to handle cases where the string contains multiple segments of '1's and '0's that need to be cyclically shifted to achieve the sorted order.

For example, consider the input string `101011`:
- The correct output should be `5`, as you can perform the following operations:
  1. Choose the substring `101011` and cyclically shift it: `101011 -> 110101` (cost = 6).
  2. Choose the substring `110101` and cyclically shift it: `110101 -> 111001` (cost = 5).
  3. Choose the substring `111001` and cyclically shift it: `111001 -> 111001` (cost = 4).

However, the provided function `func_1` calculates the cost as follows:
- It encounters the first '1' and increments `one` to 1.
- It encounters the first '0' and increments `cost` by `one + 1` (2).
- It encounters the second '1' and increments `one` to 2.
- It encounters the second '0' and increments `cost` by `one + 1` (3).
- It encounters the third '1' and increments `one` to 3.
- It encounters the third '0' and increments `cost` by `one + 1` (4).

The total cost calculated by the function is `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`, which is incorrect.

Another example is the input string `01101001`:
- The correct output should be `11`, but the function calculates it as `13`.

Thus, the function does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
