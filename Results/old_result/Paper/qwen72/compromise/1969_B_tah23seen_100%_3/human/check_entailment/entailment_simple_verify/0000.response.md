### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the provided function `func_1`. The function's logic is based on the assumption that the cost of sorting the string is the sum of the lengths of all substrings that start with a '1' and end with a '0'. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order.

Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring `[l, r]` has a cost of `r - l + 1`.

2. **Flaw in the Provided Function:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost by incrementing `cost` by `one + 1` whenever it encounters a '0' after a sequence of '1's.
   - This approach does not consider the optimal way to group '1's and '0's to minimize the total cost of cyclic shifts.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the transitions from '1' to '0' and from '0' to '1' in the string.
   - The minimum cost to sort the string is the length of the string minus the length of the longest segment of consecutive '1's or '0's, whichever is larger.

4. **Examples from the Original Assessment:**
   - For the input string `101011`:
     - The correct output should be `5`.
     - The function calculates `9`, which is incorrect.
   - For the input string `01101001`:
     - The correct output should be `11`.
     - The function calculates `13`, which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Solution:**
   - A correct solution would involve finding the longest segment of consecutive '1's or '0's and then calculating the cost as `len(s) - max(len(longest_segment_of_1s), len(longest_segment_of_0s))`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
