Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the function `func_1` does not handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to cyclically shift substrings of a binary string to make it sorted in non-descending order (i.e., all '0's should come before all '1's).
   - The cost of each operation is the length of the chosen substring.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through the string and keeps track of the number of '1's encountered (`one`).
   - When it encounters a '0' and there are '1's before it (`one > 0`), it adds `one + 1` to the cost.
   - This approach assumes that each '0' that follows a '1' requires a shift of all preceding '1's plus the '0' itself, which is not always the optimal strategy.

3. **Correctness of the Function**:
   - The function fails to consider the optimal way to group and shift substrings to minimize the total cost.
   - For example, in the string `101011`:
     - The function calculates the cost as `9` (2 + 3 + 4), but the optimal cost is `5`.
     - The optimal strategy involves:
       1. Shifting the entire string `101011` to `110101` (cost = 6).
       2. Shifting the substring `110101` to `111001` (cost = 5).
       3. The total cost is `6 + 5 = 11`, but the function does not consider this grouping.

   - Similarly, for the string `01101001`:
     - The function calculates the cost as `13`, but the optimal cost is `11`.
     - The optimal strategy involves:
       1. Shifting the substring `1101001` to `1110001` (cost = 7).
       2. Shifting the substring `1110001` to `00001111` (cost = 4).
       3. The total cost is `7 + 4 = 11`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the optimal grouping of substrings to achieve the minimum cost.
   - Therefore, the original assessment that the function is incorrect is accurate.

Final: **False**
