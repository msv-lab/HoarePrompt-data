Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, `n` is the length of `num` and 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `counter` is 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's outcome, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
