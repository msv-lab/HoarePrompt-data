Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of `num` is an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `m` is an integer (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^6), `counter` is 0, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, and the last element of `num` is not '0'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
