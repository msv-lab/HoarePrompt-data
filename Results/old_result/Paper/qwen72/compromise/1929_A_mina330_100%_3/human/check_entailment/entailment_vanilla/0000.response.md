### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from index 2 to n.
   - The formula for the beauty of the array is: \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Mathematical Simplification**:
   - The beauty can be rewritten as: \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).
   - Notice that all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving us with: \(a_n - a_1\).
   - Therefore, the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(n\) and the array elements.
   - It sorts the array \(a\).
   - It prints the difference between the last element (maximum) and the first element (minimum) of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements by sorting the array.
   - It then computes the difference between these two elements, which is the maximum beauty as derived from the problem statement.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.

**Correctness: True**
