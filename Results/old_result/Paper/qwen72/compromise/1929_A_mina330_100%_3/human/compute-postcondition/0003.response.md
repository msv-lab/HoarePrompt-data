The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500.
- `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.

The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these parameters and return a value, the nature of which is not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer where 1 <= t <= 500), `n` (an integer where 2 <= n <= 100), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^9). The function returns a value, the nature of which is not specified.**
