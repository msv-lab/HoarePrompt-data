### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input and a list `M` of `n` integers representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Initialization and Constraints:**
   - The function correctly sets `m` to the minimum of `m` and `k` to ensure that the daily purchase limit does not exceed the total number of tickets needed.
   - The list `M` is sorted in ascending order to prioritize buying tickets on the cheapest days.

3. **Calculating the Number of Days to Purchase:**
   - The variable `q` is calculated as the ceiling of `k / m`, which represents the number of days required to purchase all `k` tickets, given the daily limit `m`.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` and stores them in `N`.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is exactly `k` (i.e., `n * m == k`), the cost is calculated as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
     - `m * sum(N)` accounts for the cost of buying `m` tickets each day for `q` days.
     - `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` accounts for the additional cost due to the price increase after each purchase.
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in `q` days is not exactly `k`, the function adjusts the cost calculation:
     - It pops the last element from `N` and calculates the remaining tickets `mu` that need to be bought on the last day.
     - The cost is then calculated as `mu * w` (cost of buying `mu` tickets on the last day) plus the cost of buying `m` tickets on the remaining days, adjusted for the price increase.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the calculated cost for each test case.

### Analysis of the Cost Calculation:
- The cost calculation logic is based on the idea of buying tickets on the cheapest days first and then adjusting for the price increase.
- The formula `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` correctly accounts for the total cost of buying `m` tickets each day and the additional cost due to the price increase.
- The adjustment for the case where `n * m != k` is also correct, as it ensures that the remaining tickets are bought on the last day at the correct price.

### Potential Issues:
- The function does not handle the case where `q` is greater than `n` (the number of days). This could lead to an incorrect calculation if `k` is very large and `m` is small.
- The formula `m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)` for the additional cost due to price increase might be incorrect. The price increase should be applied to the remaining days, not just the first `q` days.

### Correctness:
- The function appears to follow the correct logic for most cases, but the handling of the price increase and the case where `q` exceeds `n` needs to be verified.
- Given the constraints and the problem description, the function should work correctly for the provided test cases, but it might need adjustments for edge cases.

### Conclusion:
- The function is mostly correct but has potential issues with edge cases and the price increase calculation.

Correctness: **False**
