Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and after each iteration, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` are updated based on the input for that iteration. After all iterations, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `M` will be the values from the last iteration, and the list `N` will be the last computed sublist of `M` used in the cost calculation. The variable `cost` will hold the final computed cost for the last iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.**
