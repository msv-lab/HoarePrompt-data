### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates `t` times.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - It initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It also initializes `st` and `end` to 0, which will be used to count consecutive equal elements from the start and end of the array.

3. **Consecutive Equal Elements**:
   - The first `while` loop increments `l` and `st` as long as the current element `a[l]` is equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`.
   - The second `while` loop decrements `r` and increments `end` as long as the current element `a[r]` is equal to the previous element `a[r - 1]`.

4. **Conditions for Minimum Cost**:
   - If the first element `a[0]` is equal to the last element `a[-1]`, the cost is `r - l - 1`. This is because the elements between `l` and `r` (excluding `l` and `r` themselves) can be made equal to `a[0]` or `a[-1]` with the cost of `r - l - 1`.
   - If the first element `a[0]` is not equal to the last element `a[-1]` and there are no consecutive equal elements from the start or end (`st == 0` and `end == 0`), the cost is `len(a) - 1`. This is because the entire array can be made equal by selecting the entire array and assigning a single value.
   - Otherwise, the cost is `r - l`. This is because the elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) can be made equal with the cost of `r - l`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum of 0 and the calculated answer `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Case 1**: `a[0] == a[-1]`
  - The cost is `r - l - 1` because the elements between `l` and `r` can be made equal to `a[0]` or `a[-1]` with the cost of `r - l - 1`.
- **Case 2**: `a[0] != a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`
  - The cost is `len(a) - 1` because the entire array can be made equal by selecting the entire array and assigning a single value.
- **Case 3**: Otherwise
  - The cost is `r - l` because the elements between `l` and `r` can be made equal with the cost of `r - l`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Array**:
  - If `n == 1`, the array is already equal, and the cost is 0.
- **All Elements Equal**:
  - If all elements in the array are equal, the cost is 0.
- **Consecutive Equal Elements**:
  - If there are consecutive equal elements from the start or end, the function correctly skips them and calculates the cost based on the remaining elements.
