The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a_i <= n. The function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of `n` for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
