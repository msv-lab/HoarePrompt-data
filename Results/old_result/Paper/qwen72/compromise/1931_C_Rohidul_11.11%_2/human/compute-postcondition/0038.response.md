Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is `n - 1`. If `a[0]` is equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `0`. If `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]` and `st == 0` and `end == 0`, then `ans` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `0`.**

Explanation:
- `l` is updated to 0.
- `r` is updated to `n - 1`.
- The values of `st` and `end` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain `0` and `n - 1` respectively.
- The conditions for `ans` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not affect `a[0]`, `a[-1]`, `st`, or `end`.
