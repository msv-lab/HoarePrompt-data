Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where the first `l` elements are all equal and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is `n - 2`, `st` is `l`, `end` is 0**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1, so it becomes `n - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
