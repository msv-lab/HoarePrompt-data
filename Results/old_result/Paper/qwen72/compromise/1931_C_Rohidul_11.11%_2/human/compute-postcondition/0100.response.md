Postcondition: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, and `ans` is `r - l`. Additionally, the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`. The condition `(st == 0 and end == 0 and (a[0] != a[-1]))` is false.**
