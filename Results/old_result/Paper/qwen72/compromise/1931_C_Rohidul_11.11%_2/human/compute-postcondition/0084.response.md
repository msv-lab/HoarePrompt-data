Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is `n - 1` and `r` must be greater than 0, `st` is the number of times the loop executed, `end` is 0, `ans` is `r - l`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than `r` and the current element `a[l]` is equal to the next element `a[l + 1]`.
- After all iterations, `l` will be the index of the first element in the list `a` that is not equal to the element immediately before it.
- `r` remains unchanged as `n - 1`, and it must still be greater than 0.
- `st` will be the number of times the loop executed, which is the number of consecutive elements at the beginning of the list that are all equal to each other.
- `end` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `ans` is calculated as `r - l`, which represents the number of elements between the first non-consecutive element and the last element in the list.
