The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This operation changes the value of `a` but does not affect the other variables directly. However, since `a` is now a new list of integers, the conditions related to `a` need to be re-evaluated.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the smallest index such that `a[l]` is not equal to `a[l+1]` or `l` is equal to `r` and `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, `r` is the largest index such that `a[r]` is equal to `a[r-1]` and `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`, `st` is the final value of `l`, `end` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of the list `a` that are equal to the element before them, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.**
