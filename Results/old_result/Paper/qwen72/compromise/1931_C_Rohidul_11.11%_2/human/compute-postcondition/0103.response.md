Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, and `end` is the number of times the loop executed. If the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `r - l - 1`. Otherwise, if `st` is 0 and `a[0]` is not equal to `a[-1]`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. In all other cases, `ans` is `r - l`.***
