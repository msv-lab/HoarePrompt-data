Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the length of the longest subarray of `a` that does not contain consecutive equal elements, after removing the maximum number of consecutive equal elements from both the start and the end of the list. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state includes the processed test cases, the last input integer `n`, the last list of integers `a`, and the calculated results for each test case. **
