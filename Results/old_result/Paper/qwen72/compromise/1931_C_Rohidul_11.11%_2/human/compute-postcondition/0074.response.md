Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 0, `end` is 0, `ans` is `r - l - 1` if the first element of `a` is equal to the last element of `a`. If the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, then `ans` is `len(a) - 1` if `st` is 0 and `end` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `r - l`.** 

The values of `st` and `end` are both set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `ans` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state. If the first and last elements of `a` are equal, `ans` is `r - l - 1`. If they are not equal and both `st` and `end` are 0, `ans` is `len(a) - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `r - l`.
