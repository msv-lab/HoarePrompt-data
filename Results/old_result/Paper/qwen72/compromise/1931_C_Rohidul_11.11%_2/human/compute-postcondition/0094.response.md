Output State: **`n` is the input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `l` is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element, `r` is the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element, `end` is the number of times the loop executed, and `ans` is `r - l`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The input integer `n` remains unchanged and must be greater than 2.
- The list `a` of integers provided by the user remains unchanged.
- The index `l` remains the same, which is the index of the first element in `a` that is not equal to the previous element.
- The index `r` is now the index of the last element in `a` that is not equal to the next element. This is because the loop decrements `r` until `a[r]` is no longer equal to `a[r - 1]`.
- The variable `end` is the total number of times the loop executed, which is the number of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to each other.
- The variable `ans` is the difference between the final value of `r` and `l`, which represents the number of elements between the first non-consecutive element and the last non-consecutive element in the list `a`.
