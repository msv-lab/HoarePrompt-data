Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and `a[0]` must be equal to `a[1]`, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1`, `st` is 1, `end` is 0, `ans` is 0**

The value of `st` is incremented by 1, so `st` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
