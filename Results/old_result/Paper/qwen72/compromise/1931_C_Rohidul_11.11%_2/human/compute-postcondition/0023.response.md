Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `a` is a list of integers where the first `l` elements are all equal and `a[r] == a[r - 1]`, `l` is the index of the first element that is not equal to the previous one or `r` if all elements up to `r` are equal, `r` is `n - 4`, `st` is `l`, `end` is 3, and `l` must be less than `n - 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `end` is incremented by 1, so `end` becomes 3.
- All other variables (`_`, `n`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `st`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `l` must be less than `n - 2` is still valid.
