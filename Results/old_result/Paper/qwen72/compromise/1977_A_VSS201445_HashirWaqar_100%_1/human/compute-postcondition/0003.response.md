Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input. It then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without retaining any of the input variables. **
