You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and for each test case, it has printed 'YES' if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even, otherwise it has printed 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` are not retained after the loop, as they are re-assigned in each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube in each move.
   - After \( n \) moves, the tower should have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The key observation is that each move changes the number of cubes by exactly 1. Therefore, the difference between the initial number of cubes (0) and the final number of cubes (\( m \)) must be an even number if Nikita can achieve it in \( n \) moves.

2. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - The number of moves \( n \) must be at least as large as the number of cubes \( m \) because Nikita cannot have more cubes than the number of moves he has made.
   - The difference \( n - m \) must be even. This is because each move changes the number of cubes by 1, and to end up with exactly \( m \) cubes, the total number of moves must be such that the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of cubes added and removed balances out to an even difference.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \) and if the difference \( n - m \) is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Verification**:
   - The condition \( n \ge m \) ensures that there are enough moves to potentially build a tower of height \( m \).
   - The condition \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the final number of cubes is even, which is necessary for the tower to have exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For \( n = 3 \) and \( m = 3 \):
     - \( n \ge m \) is true.
     - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) is true.
     - Output: "YES" (Correct).
   - For \( n = 2 \) and \( m = 4 \):
     - \( n \ge m \) is false.
     - Output: "NO" (Correct).
   - For \( n = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \):
     - \( n \ge m \) is true.
     - \( (n - m) \% 2 == 0 \) is true.
     - Output: "YES" (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. The conditions and the logic are sound and match the problem requirements.
