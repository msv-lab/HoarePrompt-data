Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n < m`. According to the problem description, if `n < m`, it is impossible for Nikita to build a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves, as he can only add or remove one cube per move. The program should return "No" in this case, but it does not. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the program will incorrectly output "YES" instead of "NO".
