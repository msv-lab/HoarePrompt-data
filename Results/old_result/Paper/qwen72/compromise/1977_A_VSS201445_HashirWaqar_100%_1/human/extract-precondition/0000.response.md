Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def func(t, cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m` for each test case. 

Given the original function definition, the correct precondition for the provided function definition would be:

Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take no parameters, which does not match the problem description. The function should be redefined to accept the appropriate parameters.**
