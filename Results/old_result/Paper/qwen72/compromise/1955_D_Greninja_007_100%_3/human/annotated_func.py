#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6.

    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `b` is a list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, `cb` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`, `ca` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each element in the sorted first m elements of list `a`, `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the first m elements of list `a` and list `b`. If `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

    #State: `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the same. `a` and `b` remain the same. `cb` remains the same. `ca` contains the frequency of each element in the sorted last `m` elements of list `a`. `sm` is the sum of the minimum frequencies of the common elements between the last `m` elements of list `a` and list `b`. `ans` is the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.
    return ans
    #The program returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`. The final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, the unchanged lists `a` and `b`, and the `ans` variable which holds the count of such subarrays.
