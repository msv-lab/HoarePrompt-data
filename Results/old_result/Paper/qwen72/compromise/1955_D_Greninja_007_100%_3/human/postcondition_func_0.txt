The function `func_1` accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency. The function does not modify the input lists `a` and `b`. The final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, the unchanged lists `a` and `b`, and the `ans` variable which holds the count of such subarrays.
