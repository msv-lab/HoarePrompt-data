The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer representing the length of the list `a`.
- `m`: an integer representing the length of the subarrays to be considered within `a`.
- `k`: an integer representing the minimum number of common elements (in terms of frequency) that a subarray of length `m` in `a` must have with the list `b`.
- `a`: a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000.
- `b`: a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_i` is between 1 and 1,000,000.

The function returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. It returns the number of subarrays of length `m` in `a` that have at least `k` common elements with `b` in terms of frequency.**
