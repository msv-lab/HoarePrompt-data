### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases, `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Counter Initialization:**
     - `cb` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in the sorted list `b`.
     - `ca` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each element in the sorted first `m` elements of list `a`.
   - **Initial Subsegment Check:**
     - The program calculates the sum of the minimum frequencies of common elements between `ca` and `cb` using `(ca & cb).values()`.
     - If this sum is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.
   - **Sliding Window:**
     - The program uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.
     - For each new element `a[r]` added to the window:
       - It checks if the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca` is less than its frequency in `cb`. If so, it increments `sm` by 1.
       - It increments the frequency of `a[r]` in `ca`.
     - For each element `a[r - m]` removed from the window:
       - It checks if the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca` is less than or equal to its frequency in `cb`. If so, it decrements `sm` by 1.
       - It decrements the frequency of `a[r - m]` in `ca`.
     - If the updated `sm` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - **Final Return:**
     - The function returns the total number of good subsegments.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^6`.
   - The sliding window approach ensures that the program efficiently checks each subsegment of length `m` in `a`.

4. **Correctness of the Sliding Window Logic:**
   - The logic for updating `ca` and `sm` is correct. It correctly accounts for the addition and removal of elements in the sliding window.
   - The condition `if ca[a[r]] < cb[a[r]]` ensures that only elements that can potentially increase the count of common elements are considered.
   - The condition `if ca[a[r - m]] <= cb[a[r - m]]` ensures that only elements that can potentially decrease the count of common elements are considered.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem using a sliding window approach with `Counter` objects to keep track of element frequencies.

Correctness: **True**
