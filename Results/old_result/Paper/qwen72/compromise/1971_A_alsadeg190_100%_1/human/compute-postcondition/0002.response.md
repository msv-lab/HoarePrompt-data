Output State: **The loop will execute `x` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `x` and `y` from the input. If `x` is less than `y`, it will print `x` and `y` in that order. Otherwise, it will print `y` and `x` in that order. After the loop finishes, the value of `x` will be the last value of `x` read from the input, and the value of `y` will be the last value of `y` read from the input. The value of `i` will be `x - 1`.**
