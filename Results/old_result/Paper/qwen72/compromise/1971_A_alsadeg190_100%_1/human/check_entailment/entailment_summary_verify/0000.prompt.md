You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `x` from the input, then iterates `x` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input. It prints the smaller of the two integers first, followed by the larger one. After the function completes, the value of `x` will be the last value of `x` read from the input, and the value of `y` will be the last value of `y` read from the input. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. The logic within the loop ensures that the correct order is printed for any pair of integers within the specified range (0 to 9). There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail based on the given constraints.
