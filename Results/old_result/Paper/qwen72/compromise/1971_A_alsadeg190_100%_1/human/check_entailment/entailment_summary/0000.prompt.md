Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Program:
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer `x` from the input, then iterates `x` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input. It prints the smaller of the two integers first, followed by the larger one. After the function completes, the value of `x` will be the last value of `x` read from the input, and the value of `y` will be the last value of `y` read from the input. The function does not return any value.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
