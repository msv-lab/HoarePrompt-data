Output State: **The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line), splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, and prints the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each pair of `n` and `k`. After the loop finishes, the values of `n` and `k` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and the function definition remains unchanged.**
