### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads from standard input, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases. This is appropriate as the first line is not needed for the calculation.
   - Each subsequent line is split into two integers `n` and `k`, which are then used in the calculation.

2. **Calculation**:
   - The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` is used to determine the minimum number of cells to color.
   - Let's break down the expression:
     - `k // 2 + k % 2` calculates the ceiling of `k / 2`. This is because if `k` is odd, `k // 2` will be the integer division, and `k % 2` will add 1 to make it the ceiling.
     - `(k < 4 * n - 3)` is a condition that checks if `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`. If true, the result of the first part of the expression is used.
     - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)` is a condition that checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`. If true, the result is `2 * n`.
     - `(k == 4 * n - 2)` is a condition that checks if `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`. If true, it adds 1 to the result.

3. **Conditions**:
   - For `k < 4 * n - 3`, the minimum number of cells to color is `ceil(k / 2)`.
   - For `k >= 4 * n - 3`, the minimum number of cells to color is `2 * n`.
   - For `k == 4 * n - 2`, an additional cell is needed, so the result is `2 * n + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the correct behavior as per the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2` by adding 1 to the result.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3` by using `2 * n`.

### Correctness:
Given the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It correctly calculates the minimum number of cells to color based on the conditions provided.

Correctness: **True**
