You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_cells_to_color(n, k):` where `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        print((k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k ==
            4 * n - 2))
        
    #State: The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line), splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`, and prints the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each pair of `n` and `k`. After the loop finishes, the values of `n` and `k` will be the last pair of integers read from the input, and the function definition remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads lines from the standard input, excluding the first line, and for each line, it splits the line into two integers `n` and `k`. It then calculates and prints the result of the expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` for each pair of `n` and `k`. After the function completes, the values of `n` and `k` will be the last pair of integers read from the input. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \) correctly. According to the problem description, the output should be the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to ensure at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell. However, the program incorrectly adds 2 to the result when \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 10
```
Here, \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \). The correct output should be 6, as shown in the problem description. However, the program will output 8 because it adds 2 to the result when \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \).

The correct logic should be:
- If \( k \) is less than \( 4n - 3 \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
- If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( 2n - 1 \).
- If \( k \) is \( 4n - 2 \), the minimum number of cells to color is \( 2n \).

The given program does not handle the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \) correctly, leading to incorrect results.
