### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads from the standard input, which is appropriate for the problem's input format.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line, splitting it into `n` and `k`.

2. **Expression for Minimum Cells to Color:**
   - The expression `(k // 2 + k % 2) * (k < 4 * n - 3) + 2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3) + (k == 4 * n - 2)` is used to calculate the minimum number of cells to color.
   - Let's break down the expression:
     - `k // 2 + k % 2` calculates the ceiling of `k / 2`.
     - `(k < 4 * n - 3)` is a boolean condition that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false.
     - `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)` calculates `2 * n` if `k` is greater than or equal to `4 * n - 3`.
     - `(k == 4 * n - 2)` is a boolean condition that evaluates to 1 if true and 0 if false.

3. **Correctness of the Expression:**
   - For `k < 4 * n - 3`, the minimum number of cells to color is `ceil(k / 2)`, which is correctly calculated by `k // 2 + k % 2`.
   - For `k >= 4 * n - 3`, the minimum number of cells to color is `2 * n`, which is correctly calculated by `2 * n * (k >= 4 * n - 3)`.
   - For `k == 4 * n - 2`, the minimum number of cells to color is `2 * n + 1`, but the expression adds 1 only if `k == 4 * n - 2`, which is correct.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `k == 4 * n - 2` by adding 1 to the result.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where `k` is less than `4 * n - 3`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of cells to color in a square grid of size `n` to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The expression used is correct and handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
