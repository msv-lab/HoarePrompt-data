Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the way it calculates the number of valid pairs. Specifically, the formula used to calculate `x` and the condition `if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:` do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

The problem requires finding pairs `(a, b)` such that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the code attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs using a formula that does not directly check this condition. Instead, it uses a derived formula that seems to be an attempt to optimize the calculation but does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.

A correct approach would involve iterating through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition `a + b % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0` for each pair. This can be optimized by recognizing patterns or properties of the gcd function, but the current implementation does not correctly achieve this.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

func()
```

This version iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly, ensuring the correctness of the solution.
