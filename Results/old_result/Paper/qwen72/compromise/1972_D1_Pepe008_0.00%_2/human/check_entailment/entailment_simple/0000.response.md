Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Let's break down the provided program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(T\).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Logic for Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The program initializes a variable `suma` to 0.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

- The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This formula seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs but does not correctly implement the required condition.
- The subtraction of 1 at the end (`print(suma - 1)`) is not justified and seems arbitrary.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

- For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
  - (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (7,1), (8,1), (9,1), (10,1), (10,2)
  - There are 14 valid pairs.

The program should correctly count these pairs. However, the current implementation does not match the expected output for this example.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
