The given code snippet updates the value of `x` based on the current values of `a` and `i`. Let's calculate the new value of `x`:

Given:
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet:
```python
x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
```

Breaking down the calculation:
1. Calculate `i * (i - 1)`: Since `i` is 2, this becomes `2 * (2 - 1) = 2 * 1 = 2`.
2. Subtract this from `a`: `a - 2`.
3. Divide the result by `i ** 2`: Since `i` is 2, `i ** 2` is `2 ** 2 = 4`. So, `(a - 2) // 4`.
4. Add 1 to the result: `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

Therefore, the new value of `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `suma` is 0, `i` is 2, `x` is `(a - 2) // 4 + 1`.**
