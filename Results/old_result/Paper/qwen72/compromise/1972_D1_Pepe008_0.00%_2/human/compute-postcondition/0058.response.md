Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `x` is \(\left( a - 6 \right) // 9 + 1\), `suma` is increased by \(\left( a - 6 \right) // 9 + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated as \(\left( a - 6 \right) // 9 + 1\).
- The value of `suma` is incremented by the value of `x`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
