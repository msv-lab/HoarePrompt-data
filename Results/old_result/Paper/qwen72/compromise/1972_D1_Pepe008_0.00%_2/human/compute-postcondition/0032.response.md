The code snippet updates the value of `x` based on the current values of `a` and `i`. Given that `i` is initially set to `b`, and `a` and `b` are derived from `info`, the new value of `x` is calculated as follows:

- `x` is updated to \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- Since `i` is initially `b`, the expression simplifies to \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1\).

Given the initial conditions, the value of `x` is recalculated based on the new formula. All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `suma`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 1, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the new input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is 0, `x` is \((a - b \cdot (b - 1)) // b^2 + 1\).**
