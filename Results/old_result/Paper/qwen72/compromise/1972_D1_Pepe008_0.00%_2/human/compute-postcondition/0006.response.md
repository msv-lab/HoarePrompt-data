To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(1, b + 1):
```

The loop head involves the variable `i` and the variable `b`. The loop will execute if `b` is at least 1, because `range(1, b + 1)` will generate a sequence starting from 1 up to `b` (inclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `t` is 0
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`
- `suma` is 0

We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `b` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `b` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `i` is 1

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `suma`) do not affect the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**
