Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `N` remains the input integer
- `nums` is a list of integers where each element is 0
- `ls` is the sum of the initial elements in `nums`
- `nw` is True
- `cw` is True

The code snippet to be evaluated is:
```python
print('Alice')
```

This `print` statement simply prints the string 'Alice'. The values of the variables and objects mentioned in the initial state do not affect the output of this statement.

Output: **Alice**
