Output State: **`t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `N` remains the input integer, `nums` is a list of integers where each element is 0, `ls` is the sum of the initial elements in `nums`, `nw` is True.** 

The variable `nw` is set to `True`, and the other variables (`t`, `N`, `nums`, and `ls`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
