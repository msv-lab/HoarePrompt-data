Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Bob
```

In this test case, Alice can win by choosing \( k = 1 \) on her first turn, which will reduce the piles to \( [0, 1, 2] \). On Bob's turn, he will be forced to choose \( k = 1 \), reducing the piles to \( [0, 0, 1] \). Alice can then choose \( k = 1 \) again, emptying the last pile and winning the game. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" as the winner.
