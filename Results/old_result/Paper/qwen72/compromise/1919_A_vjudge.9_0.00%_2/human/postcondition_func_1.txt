The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It prompts the user to enter the number of test cases, `t`, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the user, calls the function `func_1(a, b)`, and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of the `results` list to the console in the order they were added. The list `results` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
