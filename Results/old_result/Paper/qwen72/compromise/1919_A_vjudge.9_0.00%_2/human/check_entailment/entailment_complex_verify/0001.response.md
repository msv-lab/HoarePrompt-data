### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After making a decision, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally.
   - If the total number of coins `(a + b)` is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally.
   - This is because the game will end in an even number of turns if the total number of coins is even, and in an odd number of turns if the total number of coins is odd. Since Alice starts, Bob will make the last move in an even-numbered game, and Alice will make the last move in an odd-numbered game.

3. **Explanation of the Parity Rule:**
   - If `(a + b)` is even, the game will end in an even number of turns. Since Alice starts, Bob will make the last move, and Alice will be unable to make a move after Bob's turn.
   - If `(a + b)` is odd, the game will end in an odd number of turns. Since Alice starts, Alice will make the last move, and Bob will be unable to make a move after Alice's turn.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the optimal play analysis.

4. **Function 1:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of `(a + b)`.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 == 0`, it returns 'Bob'.
   - If `(a + b) % 2 != 0`, it returns 'Alice'.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the optimal play analysis.

5. **Function 2:**
   - The function `func_2()` handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.
   - This function correctly processes the input and output as specified in the problem description.

### Validation of Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The function `func_1` is correctly annotated to return 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd.
- The function `func_2` is correctly annotated to handle multiple test cases, read inputs, call `func_1`, and print the results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. Both functions are implemented correctly and follow the logic required to solve the problem. The program will produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
