Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1(a, b)` determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this approach does not correctly model the game's rules, particularly the optimal play strategy. The game involves players making strategic decisions to swap wallets or not, and then removing a coin, which can lead to different outcomes depending on the initial number of coins and the sequence of moves.

A counterexample where the program fails is:
- **Input:** `a = 2`, `b = 1`
- **Expected Output:** `Alice`
- **Actual Output:** `Bob`

In this case, Alice can win by swapping wallets with Bob on her first move, making `a = 1` and `b = 2`. Then, Bob will remove a coin from his wallet, making `a = 1` and `b = 1`. Alice will then remove a coin from her wallet, making `a = 0` and `b = 1`. Bob will be forced to remove a coin from his wallet, making `a = 0` and `b = 0`. Since Bob's wallet is now empty, Alice wins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" because it only checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd, which does not capture the strategic nature of the game.
