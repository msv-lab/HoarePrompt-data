### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns to either swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The key to determining the winner lies in the parity (odd or even) of the total number of coins `(a + b)`.
   - If the total number of coins is even, Bob will always win because Alice and Bob can mirror each other's moves. This means that whatever Alice does, Bob can do the same, and eventually, Alice will be the one who cannot make a move.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a position where Bob will be the one who cannot make a move.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function checks the sum of `a` and `b`. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'. If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This logic is correct based on the optimal strategy described above.
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `a` and `b`, calling `func_1(a, b)`, and storing the result in a list `results`.
     - After processing all test cases, it prints the results in the order they were stored.
     - The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are both 1 (sum is 2, even, so Bob wins).
   - The function `func_1` also correctly handles cases where `a` and `b` are large numbers (up to \(10^9\)).

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` is correct and matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. It correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the optimal strategy and handles the input and output as specified.
