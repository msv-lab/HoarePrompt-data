Output State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`, `s` is the result of `i` XOR 2147483647.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is calculated as the bitwise XOR (`^`) of `i` (the first element of `data`) and `check` (which is 2147483647).
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
