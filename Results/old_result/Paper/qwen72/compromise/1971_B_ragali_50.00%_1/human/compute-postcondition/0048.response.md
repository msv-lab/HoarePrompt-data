Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is the last character in `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing all unique characters in `s`, and the number of unique characters in `s` is greater than 1. `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `newstr` is equal to `s`. If `isreverse` is not equal to `s`, then `isreverse` remains the reversed version of `s`. If `isreverse` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` remains equal to `s`.***
