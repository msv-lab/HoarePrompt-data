Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is the last character in `s`, `s` is the input string with leading and trailing spaces removed, `a` is a set containing all unique characters in `s`. If the number of unique characters in `s` is greater than 1 and `newstr` is not equal to `s`, then `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` with the first half of `s`, and `isreverse` is the reversed version of `s`. If the number of unique characters in `s` is greater than 1 and `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` remains the reversed version of `s` if it is not equal to `s`, and remains equal to `s` if it is equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is 1, `newstr` and `isreverse` are not modified.***
