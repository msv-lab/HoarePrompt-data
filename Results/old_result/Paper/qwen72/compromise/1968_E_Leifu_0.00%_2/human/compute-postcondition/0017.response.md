The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `n` is 3, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is set to `n + 1`.**
