The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` being less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 3, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 5**
