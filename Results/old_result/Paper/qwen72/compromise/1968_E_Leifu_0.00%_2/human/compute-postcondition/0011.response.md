The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4, `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 5, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
