Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string input by the user.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from `s[0]` and `x` is not -1.
- The result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is `True`.
- `x` is not equal to 1.
- `x` is not equal to `n // 2`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Analysis:
1. **String `s` and Length `n`**:
   - `s` is a string provided by the user.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.

2. **Index `x`**:
   - `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that is different from the first character `s[0]`.
   - `x` is guaranteed to be a valid index (not -1), and it is not equal to 1 or `n // 2`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(s[x + 1:])` is called with the substring of `s` starting from `x + 1` to the end of the string.
   - The result of this function call is `True`.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The code snippet contains a simple `print('YES')` statement.
   - This statement will always print the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `s`, `n`, `x`, or the result of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('YES')` statement will print the string `'YES'` because the conditions in the initial state ensure that the function `func_1` returns `True`, and the print statement is not dependent on any other variable or condition.

Output: **YES**
