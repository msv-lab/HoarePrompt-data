Reasoning:  
The given program is incorrect. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the input string `s` and prints their sum. However, this approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring, not just counting how many times these substrings appear.

For example, consider the string "mmapnapie":
- The program will count "map" once and "pie" once, and output 2.
- However, to make the string beautiful, we can remove just 2 characters (the 4th and 9th characters) to get "mmapnape", which does not contain "map" or "pie".

The correct approach would involve identifying the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie" and calculating the minimum number of deletions required to eliminate all occurrences of these substrings. The current program does not handle this correctly.

Correctness: **False**
