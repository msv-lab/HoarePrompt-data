Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful.
   - A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure neither "pie" nor "map" appears as a substring.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of these counts.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program uses `s.count('map')` and `s.count('pie')` to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
   - This approach is incorrect because it only counts the exact occurrences of "map" and "pie" as substrings, not the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.
   - For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", but removing just 2 characters (the 4th and 9th) can make the string beautiful.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify all positions where the substrings "pie" or "map" appear and determine the minimum number of characters to remove to eliminate these substrings.
   - This can be done by iterating through the string and checking for the presence of "pie" and "map" at each position, then calculating the minimum deletions required.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts the exact occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and does not consider the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful.
   - The function summary confirms that the program only counts the substrings and prints their sum, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum deletions.

Final: **False**
