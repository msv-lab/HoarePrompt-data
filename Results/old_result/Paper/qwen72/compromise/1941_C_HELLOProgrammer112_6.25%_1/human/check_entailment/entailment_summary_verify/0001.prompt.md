You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used) and a string `s`. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s` and prints the sum of these counts. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed, and the counts have been printed. The input variables `t` and `s` are not modified by the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful.
   - A string is considered ugly if it contains the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to ensure neither "pie" nor "map" appears as a substring.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
   - It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of these counts.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program uses `s.count('map')` and `s.count('pie')` to count the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
   - However, this approach is incorrect because it only counts the exact occurrences of "map" and "pie" as substrings, not the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful.
   - For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program will count 1 occurrence of "map" and 1 occurrence of "pie", but removing just 2 characters (the 4th and 9th) can make the string beautiful.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify all positions where the substrings "pie" or "map" appear and determine the minimum number of characters to remove to eliminate these substrings.
   - This can be done by iterating through the string and checking for the presence of "pie" and "map" at each position, then calculating the minimum deletions required.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly solve the problem because it only counts the exact occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and does not consider the minimum deletions required to make the string beautiful.
