The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `lk`. For the loop to execute, the range must contain at least one value, which means `lk - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `lk` must be at least 1. Since `lk` is the length of the string `bk`, and `bk` is the binary representation of `k`, `lk` will always be at least 1 as long as `k` is a positive integer (which it is, given the constraints).

However, the loop will not execute if `lk` is 1, because `range(lk - 1)` would be `range(0)`, which is an empty range. Therefore, `lk` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `k` is not equal to 1, the binary representation of `k` (`bk`) will have a length greater than 1 if `k` is at least 2. This is because the binary representation of 1 is "1", which has a length of 1, and the binary representation of any number greater than 1 will have at least 2 bits (e.g., "10" for 2).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `lk` is greater than 1, which is already satisfied by the given constraints that `k` is not equal to 1 and `1 <= k <= n`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `k` is not equal to 1, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the string `bk` and must be greater than 1, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list**
