You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func_14():
    n, k = func_7()
    b = bin(n)[2:]
    l = len(b)
    if (k == 1) :
        if (n == 2) :
            return '1\n2'
            #The program returns the string '1\n2'.
        #State: *`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`, and the current value of `k` is 1. Additionally, `n` is not equal to 2.
        ans = [2, 3]

        #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`, `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, ...] (up to 2
    else :
        bk = bin(k)[2:]
        ans = []
        lk = len(bk)
        for i in range(lk - 1):
            ans.append(2 ** i)
            
        #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), `lk` is the length of the string `bk`.
        ans.append(k - 1 - sum(ans))

        #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of the string `bk`, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1).
    #State: `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`. If `k == 1`, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9). Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix and `lk` is the length of the string `bk`.
    return str(len(ans)) + '\n' + ' '.join(map(str, ans))
    #The program returns a string that consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The length of `ans` and the elements in `ans` depend on the value of `k` and the binary representation of `n` and `k`. If `k == 1`, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9), resulting in a list of 10 elements. Otherwise, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function returns a string. If `k == 1`, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it returns a string containing the length of a list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The list `ans` is constructed based on the binary representation of `n` and `k`. If `k == 1`, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 512. If `k` is not 1, `ans` contains specific powers of 2 and additional values derived from `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string '1\n2'.

Case_2: The program returns a string that consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The length of `ans` and the elements in `ans` depend on the value of `k` and the binary representation of `n` and `k`. If `k == 1`, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9), resulting in a list of 10 elements. Otherwise, `ans` contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), followed by `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
