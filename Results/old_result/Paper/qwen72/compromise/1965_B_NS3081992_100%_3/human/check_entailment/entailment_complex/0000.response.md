### Reasoning:

1. **Function 10 (`func_10`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It returns an integer, which is the number of test cases.

2. **Function 14 (`func_14`)**:
   - This function reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It constructs a sequence `ans` of non-negative integers that meets the problem's requirements:
     - **If `k == 1`**:
       - If `n == 2`, it returns the string '1\n2'.
       - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence of powers of 2 starting from 2 up to \(2^9\) (i.e., 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512). This sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences.
     - **If `k != 1`**:
       - It constructs a sequence of powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
       - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure that the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
       - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that all values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed by subsequences.
       - Finally, it appends the remaining powers of 2 from \(2^{lk}\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Function 15 (`func_15`)**:
   - This function iterates over the number of test cases `t` (obtained from `func_10`).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_14` to get the sequence and prints it.

### Analysis:
- **Reading Input**: The functions `func_10` and `func_7` correctly read the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` from the input.
- **Sequence Construction**:
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed.
  - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed.
- **Output**: The function `func_15` correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem's requirements and is logically correct. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
