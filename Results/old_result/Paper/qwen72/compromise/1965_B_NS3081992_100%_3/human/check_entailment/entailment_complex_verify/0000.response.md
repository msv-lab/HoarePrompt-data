### Reasoning:

1. **Function 14 Analysis**:
   - **Case \( k = 1 \)**:
     - If \( n = 2 \), the function correctly returns '1\n2', which is a valid sequence.
     - If \( n > 2 \), the function initializes `ans` with `[2, 3]` and then appends the powers of 2 from \( 2^2 \) to \( 2^{l-1} \), where \( l \) is the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
     - This logic is flawed because it does not ensure that all sums from 1 to \( n \) except 1 can be formed. For example, when \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), the sequence `[2, 3]` cannot form the sum 1, which is required.

2. **Correctness for \( k = 1 \)**:
   - For \( k = 1 \) and \( n > 2 \), the sequence should be able to form all sums from 1 to \( n \) except 1.
   - The current implementation only includes powers of 2 starting from 2, which means it cannot form the sum 1.
   - A correct approach would be to include 1 in the sequence and then ensure that all other sums can be formed. For example, for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 1 \), a valid sequence could be `[1, 2]`.

3. **Case \( k \ne 1 \)**:
   - The function correctly initializes `ans` with the powers of 2 from \( 2^0 \) to \( 2^{lk-2} \), where \( lk \) is the length of the binary representation of \( k \).
   - It then appends \( k - 1 - \text{sum}(ans) \), \( k + 1 \), and \( 2k + 1 \) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it appends the powers of 2 from \( 2^{lk} \) to \( 2^{l-1} \), where \( l \) is the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
   - This logic ensures that no subsequence sums to \( k \) and all other sums from 1 to \( n \) can be formed.

4. **Overall Program**:
   - The main function `func_15` correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - However, the logic in `func_14` for \( k = 1 \) is incorrect, which affects the overall correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where \( k = 1 \) and \( n > 2 \) correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
