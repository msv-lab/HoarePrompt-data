### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, `func_14()` is called to generate the required sequence.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - `func_14()` reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.
   - It then constructs a sequence `ans` based on the values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the function returns the sequence `1\n2`.
   - If `k == 1` and `n != 2`, the function returns a sequence of powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9), which ensures that all values from 1 to `n` can be formed except for `k`.

4. **General Case:**
   - If `k != 1`, the function constructs a sequence `ans` that includes:
     - Powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
     - The value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, which ensures that the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - The values `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - Powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the length of the sequence `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.

6. **Validation:**
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k`.
   - The sequence `ans` is also constructed to ensure that all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by some subsequence of `ans`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements. It constructs a sequence that meets the conditions for each test case and ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed. The sequence is also limited to a size of at most 25, which is within the problem constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
