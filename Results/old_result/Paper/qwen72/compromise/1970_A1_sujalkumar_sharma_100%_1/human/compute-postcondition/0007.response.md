Output State: **`prefix_balance` is sorted based on the balance at each position in ascending order. If two positions have the same balance, they are sorted by the index in descending order. The final value of `balance` is 0, as the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence. `result` is a string formed by concatenating the third elements of each tuple in `prefix_balance`.**
