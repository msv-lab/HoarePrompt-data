The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a string `result` that is a rearranged version of `s` based on the balance of parentheses at each position. The rearrangement ensures that the parentheses are still balanced, but the order is adjusted according to the balance and position.
