Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**: It initializes an empty list `prefix_balance` to store tuples of the form `(balance, position, character)`. It then iterates through the string, calculating the balance at each position and appending the tuple to `prefix_balance`.
3. **Sorting**: The list `prefix_balance` is sorted based on the balance in ascending order, and for ties, it sorts by position in descending order. This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the specified rules.
4. **Result Construction**: The sorted list is used to construct the result string by extracting the characters from the tuples.
5. **Output**: The result string is printed.

The program adheres to the problem's requirements and the execution summary confirms that it behaves as expected. The sorting and construction steps are implemented correctly, and the program should handle the input constraints (non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a maximum length of 500,000).

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
