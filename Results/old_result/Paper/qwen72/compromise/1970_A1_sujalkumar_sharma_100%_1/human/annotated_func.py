#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    prefix_balance = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the balance at each position, the index of the position, and the character at that position in the string `s`. The final value of `balance` is 0, as the string `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence.
    prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
    return result
    #The program returns a string `result` formed by concatenating the third elements of each tuple in `prefix_balance`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")" with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a string `result` that is a rearranged version of `s` based on the balance of parentheses at each position. The rearrangement ensures that the parentheses are still balanced, but the order is adjusted according to the balance and position.
