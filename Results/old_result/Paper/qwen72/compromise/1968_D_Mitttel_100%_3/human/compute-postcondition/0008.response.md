Output State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` remains `[P_B, P_S]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(0, cur + k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, cur + k * a[P_S])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S]`, `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1.**
