Output State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(mx, cur + (k-1) * a[s])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s] + a[s]`, `vis[s]` is `True`**

Explanation:
- `s` is updated to the value of `p[s]`.
- `k` is decreased by 1, but it remains greater than 0.
- `mx` is updated to the maximum value between the current `mx` and `cur + (k-1) * a[s]`.
- `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s] + a[s]`.
- `a` and `p` remain unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `vis[s]` remains `True`.
