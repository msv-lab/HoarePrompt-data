Output State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(0, cur + k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, cur + k * a[P_S])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S]`, `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1.**

Explanation:
- `s` is updated to `p[s]`, which means `s` now holds the value of `p[s]` based on the initial state where `s` was `[P_B, P_S]`.
- `k` is decreased by 1, so its new value is `k - 1`.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `mx` is updated to `max(0, cur + k * a[P_B])` or `max(0, cur + k * a[P_S])`, depending on the value of `s` after the update.
- `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S]`.
- `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1.
