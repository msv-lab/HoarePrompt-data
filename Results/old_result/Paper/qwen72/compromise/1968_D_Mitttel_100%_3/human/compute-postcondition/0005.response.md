The code `vis[s] = 1` updates the `vis` list by setting the element at the index specified by `s` to 1. Since `s` is a list of two integers `[P_B, P_S]`, the code will set the elements at indices `P_B - 1` and `P_S - 1` to 1, because Python list indices are 0-based. 

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`.
   - `p` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - `a` contains integers where 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
   - `s` is a list of two integers `[P_B, P_S]` where 1 ≤ `P_B`, `P_S` ≤ `n`.
   - `k` is a positive integer where 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9.
   - `n` is the length of the list `p`.
   - `mx` is 0.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `vis` is a list of `n` zeros.

2. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The element at index `P_B - 1` in `vis` is set to 1.
   - The element at index `P_S - 1` in `vis` is set to 1.

3. **Output State:**
   - `a` and `p` remain unchanged.
   - `s` remains `[P_B, P_S]`.
   - `k` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `mx` remains 0.
   - `cur` remains 0.
   - `vis` is updated such that `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1.

Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element of `p` is a distinct integer from 1 to `n`, and each element of `a` is an integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is a list of two integers `[P_B, P_S]` representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively, where 1 ≤ `P_B`, `P_S` ≤ `n`. `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^9) representing the number of turns in the game. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is 0. `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of `n` integers where `vis[P_B - 1]` and `vis[P_S - 1]` are both set to 1, and all other elements remain 0.**
