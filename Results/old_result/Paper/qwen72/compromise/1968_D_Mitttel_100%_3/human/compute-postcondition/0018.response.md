Output State: **`a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to `p[s]`, `k` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is updated to `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`, `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s]`, `vis[s]` is `True`**

Explanation:
- `mx` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cur + k * a[s]`. The value of `k` is greater than 0 and is decreased by 1, but its new value is still used in this calculation.
- `cur` is updated to `a[P_B] + a[P_S] + a[s]`, where `s` is the updated value from `p[s]`.
- All other variables (`a`, `p`, `n`, and `vis[s]`) remain unchanged or retain their updated values from the initial state.
