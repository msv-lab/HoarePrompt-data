You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The loop terminates when either `k` reaches 0 or `vis[s]` becomes 1. At this point, `a` and `p` remain unchanged, `s` is the position where the loop terminates, `k` is the remaining number of turns (which could be 0), `n` remains unchanged, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` observed during the loop execution, `cur` is the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop, and `vis` is a list where the elements at the positions visited by the loop are set to 1.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` observed during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of the elements of `a` at the positions visited during the loop, `k` is the remaining number of turns (which could be 0), and `a[s]` is the element of the list `a` at the position `s` where the loop terminates.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing. This is necessary because Python lists are 0-based.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It creates a list `vis` of size `n` initialized to 0, which will keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The while loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and there are turns left (`k > 0`).
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of the current `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Score Comparison:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
   - If Sasha's score is greater, it prints "Sasha".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same correctly.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the permutation and array are large (up to the constraints).

5. **Infinite Loops:**
   - The program avoids infinite loops by using the `vis` list to mark visited positions. This ensures that the loop will terminate when a cycle is detected or when all turns are used up.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering the score at each position and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
   - The use of `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` ensures that the player's score is maximized by either staying or moving to the next position.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the game is played according to the rules.
