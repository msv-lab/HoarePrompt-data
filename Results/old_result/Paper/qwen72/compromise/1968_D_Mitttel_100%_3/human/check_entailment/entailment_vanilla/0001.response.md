### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Adjustment:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indexing. This is necessary because Python lists are 0-based.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` and playing for `k` turns.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It creates a list `vis` of size `n` initialized to 0, which will keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.
   - The while loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited and there are turns left (`k > 0`).
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum of the current `mx` and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position `a[s]` to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Score Comparison:**
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints "Draw".
   - If Bodya's score is greater, it prints "Bodya".
   - If Sasha's score is greater, it prints "Sasha".

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the starting positions are the same correctly.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the permutation and array are large (up to the constraints).

5. **Infinite Loops:**
   - The program avoids infinite loops by using the `vis` list to mark visited positions. This ensures that the loop will terminate when a cycle is detected or when all turns are used up.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the maximum possible score for each player by considering the score at each position and the potential score if the player stays at the current position for the remaining turns.
   - The use of `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` ensures that the player's score is maximized by either staying or moving to the next position.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. It handles all edge cases and ensures that the game is played according to the rules.
