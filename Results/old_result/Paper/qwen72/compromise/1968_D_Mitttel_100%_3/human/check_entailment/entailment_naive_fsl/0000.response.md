Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in the function `func_1`. Specifically, the program incorrectly modifies the `a` array by subtracting 1 from each element, which is not part of the problem description. The `a` array should represent the scores at each position without any modifications. This error can lead to incorrect scores being calculated.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
The correct output should be:
```
Bodya
```
However, the program modifies the `a` array to `[6, 1, 4, 5]` and then calculates the scores based on these modified values, leading to incorrect results.
