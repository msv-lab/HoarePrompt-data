Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'. `int(input())` is the total number of iterations the loop has executed. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then this relationship holds true.***
