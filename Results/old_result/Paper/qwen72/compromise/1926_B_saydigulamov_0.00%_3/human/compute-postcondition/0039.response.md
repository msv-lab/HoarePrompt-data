The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `a` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `a` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is a list containing the count of '1' characters in each input string `b` that contains at least one '1'. The length of `k` is equal to the number of input strings that contained at least one '1'. If the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`, then this relationship holds true.**
