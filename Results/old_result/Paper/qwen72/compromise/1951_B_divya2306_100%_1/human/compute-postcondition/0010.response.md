To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head: `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `win_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element exists.
- `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.
- `n`, `k`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged.
- `wins` is less than `k`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State of `wins`**: `wins` is less than `k`.
2. **Initial State of `win_with_swap`**: `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute if `win_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`.

Since `wins` is less than `k`, `win_with_swap` (which is `wins + 1`) must be less than `k` as well. However, for the loop to execute, `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes:
- `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.
- `i` starts at `win_with_swap` and goes up to `k - 2` (since `range(win_with_swap, k - 1)` is exclusive of `k - 1`).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `win_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`.

State: **`wins` is less than `k - 1`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, `i` is `win_with_swap`, `k` is greater than `win_with_swap`**
