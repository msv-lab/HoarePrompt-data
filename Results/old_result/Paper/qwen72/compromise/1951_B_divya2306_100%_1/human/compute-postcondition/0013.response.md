The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters:
- `n`: an integer representing the number of cows, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5.
- `k`: an integer representing the index of your cow, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `a`: a list of `n` distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows.

The function returns:
- `wins`: the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element exists, and `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is the number of cows, `k` is the index of your cow, and `a` is a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings. It returns the number of cows with ratings less than or equal to your cow's rating before encountering a cow with a higher rating, or `n` if no higher-rated cow is found, provided that this number is at least `k`.**
