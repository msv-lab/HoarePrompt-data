You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of cows (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` is the index of your cow (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Additionally, it should take a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided as input. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of Cowdeforces ratings `a`.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `wins` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list `a` to count how many matches your cow can win without any swaps.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it encounters a cow with a higher rating than your cow.
   - This part is correct because it simulates the matches as described in the problem.

3. **Win with Swap Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`. If so, it prints `wins - 1` and returns. This is incorrect because if `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means your cow has already won all possible matches without any swaps, and the maximum number of wins should be `wins - 1` (since the first match is between positions 1 and 2, and your cow starts at position 1).
   - It initializes `win_with_swap` to `wins + 1` to account for the initial win plus the potential additional win from the swap.
   - It then iterates from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1` to count how many additional matches your cow can win after the swap.
   - The loop breaks as soon as it encounters a cow with a higher rating than your cow.
   - This part is correct in calculating the potential wins after a swap.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`.
   - The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is intended to adjust the number of wins after the swap. However, it is overly complex and potentially incorrect.

### Issues:
- The condition `if wins >= k` is incorrect. If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, it means your cow has already won all possible matches without any swaps, and the maximum number of wins should be `wins - 1` (since the first match is between positions 1 and 2, and your cow starts at position 1).
- The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is overly complex and may not correctly represent the number of wins after the swap.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        wins += 1
    if wins == 1:
        print(0)
        return
    win_with_swap = 1
    for i in range(k - 1, n - 1):
        if a[i + 1] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        win_with_swap += 1
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - 1))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Wins Calculation**:
  - The loop correctly counts the number of matches your cow can win without any swaps.
- **Win with Swap Calculation**:
  - The loop starts from the position of your cow and counts how many additional matches your cow can win after the swap.
  - The condition `if wins == 1` is added to handle the case where your cow wins only the first match and then loses, in which case the maximum number of wins is 0.
- **Output**:
  - The program prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - 1`, which correctly represents the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

### Correctness:
**False**

The original program has logical issues in handling the condition where your cow wins all possible matches without any swaps and in the calculation of wins after the swap. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.
