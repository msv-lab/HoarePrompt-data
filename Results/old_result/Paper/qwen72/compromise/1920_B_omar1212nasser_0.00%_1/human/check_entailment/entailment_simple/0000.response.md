### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a good approach because it allows Alice to remove the smallest elements (which minimizes the impact on the sum) and Bob to multiply the largest elements by -1 (which maximizes the negative impact on the sum).

3. **Function `func_2` Logic:**
   - The function `func_2` is designed to calculate the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played their moves.
   - The function starts by calculating the initial sum `s` of the array and the sum `n` of the last `x` elements (which are the largest elements after sorting).
   - It then calculates the sum after removing `i` elements and multiplying the largest `x` elements by -1, storing these values in the list `pos`.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `removals` (inclusive), updating the sum `s` and `n` accordingly.
   - The `try` block is used to handle the case where the index goes out of bounds, setting `n` to 0 in such cases.

4. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The special case where `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3` is handled by returning 0 immediately. This is a specific condition that might be a part of the test cases, but it is not a general solution and should be removed for a more robust and general solution.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The function returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which represents the optimal sum after Alice and Bob have played their moves.

### Issues:
- **Special Case Handling:** The special case `if (removals == 6 and negatives == 3): return 0` is not a general solution and should be removed. This condition might be specific to a test case but does not apply to all cases.
- **Indexing and Edge Cases:** The use of `elements[-(negatives + i)]` and `elements[-i]` might lead to incorrect results if the array is too short. The `try` block handles this by setting `n` to 0, but this might not always be the correct behavior.

### Correctness:
- The overall logic of the program is correct, but the special case handling and potential edge cases in indexing need to be addressed for a fully robust solution.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has a specific special case that is not general and might lead to incorrect results in other scenarios. Additionally, the handling of edge cases in the indexing might not always be correct. These issues need to be fixed for the program to be considered fully correct.
