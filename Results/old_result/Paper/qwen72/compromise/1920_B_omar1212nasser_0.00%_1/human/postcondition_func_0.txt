The function `func_1` reads a positive integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three non-negative integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calls another function `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and the sorted list `a`. The result of `func_2` is printed for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains the same, and the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and `a` are reset for each iteration of the loop. The function does not return any value but prints the product of `func_2` for each test case.
