### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `a` (the length of the array) and the list `b` (the array itself).

2. **Processing Logic**:
   - The function iterates over the array `b` from index `0` to `a-3` (i.e., `i` ranges from `0` to `a-3`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `b[i]` is non-negative, it modifies the array as follows:
     - `b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2`
     - `b[i + 2] -= b[i]`
     - `b[i] -= b[i]` (which is equivalent to `b[i] = 0`).
   - This logic is intended to simulate the operation described in the problem, where elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` are modified.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if the last two elements of the array `b` are zero.
   - If either `b[-1]` or `b[-2]` is not zero, it prints 'NO'.
   - If both are zero, it prints 'YES'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Indexing in the Loop**:
  - The loop should iterate from `1` to `a-2` (i.e., `i` ranges from `1` to `a-2`), not from `0` to `a-3`. This is because the operation is defined for indices `2` to `n-1`, which correspond to `1` to `a-2` in zero-based indexing.
  - The current loop logic can lead to incorrect modifications of the array elements, especially for the first few elements.

- **Incorrect Final Check**:
  - The final check should ensure that all elements of the array are zero, not just the last two elements.
  - The current logic only checks the last two elements, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, the loop should start from `1` and the final check should verify all elements of the array.

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        for i in range(1, a - 1):
            if b[i - 1] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i] -= b[i - 1] * 2
            b[i + 1] -= b[i - 1]
            b[i - 1] = 0
        else:
            if any(x != 0 for x in b):
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The original program has logical errors in the loop indexing and the final check, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected program addresses these issues and should be used instead.
