The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop variable, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is the loop variable, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
