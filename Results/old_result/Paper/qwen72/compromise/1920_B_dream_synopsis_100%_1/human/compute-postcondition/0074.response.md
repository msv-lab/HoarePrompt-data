The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The values of `i`, `k + 1`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, `k + 1` remains unchanged, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k + 1` remains unchanged, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`**
