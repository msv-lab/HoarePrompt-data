The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to its current value. The value of `i` was previously incremented by 1, so `i - 1` refers to the index before the increment. The value of `k + 1` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is incremented by 1, `k + 1` remains unchanged, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
Output State: **`i` is incremented by 1, `k + 1` remains unchanged, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.**
