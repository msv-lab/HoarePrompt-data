Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing two elements, `t - 1` iterations remain. If `i` is 0, `sums` is set to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`, and both elements in `ans` are `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the second element in `ans` is the updated value of `sums`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`, and the second element in `ans` is the updated value of `sums`.***
