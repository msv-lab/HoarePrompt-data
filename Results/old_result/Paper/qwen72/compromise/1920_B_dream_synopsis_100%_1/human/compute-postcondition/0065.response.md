Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sums`, `t - 1` iterations remain, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, `ans`) retain their previous values.
- The condition `i + x - 1 < n` is assumed to be true for this update to occur. If `i + x - 1 >= n`, the update would be different, but since the code specifies the update as given, we assume the condition holds.
