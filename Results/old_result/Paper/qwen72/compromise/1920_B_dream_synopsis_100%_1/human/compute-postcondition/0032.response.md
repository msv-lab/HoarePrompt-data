The code `ans.append(sums)` adds the value of `sums` to the end of the list `ans`. The value of `sums` is calculated as `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])` appended to its previous contents, `i` is incremented by 1, and `i` must be less than `k + 1`, `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x])`.**
