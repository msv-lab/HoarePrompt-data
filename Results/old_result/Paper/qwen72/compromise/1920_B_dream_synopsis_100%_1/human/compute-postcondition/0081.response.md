To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer read from the input.
   - `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0.
   - `x` is the third integer read from the input.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed.
   - `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`.
   - `i` is equal to `k + 1`.
   - `ans` is a list containing `k + 1` elements.
   - `t - 1` iterations remain.
   - The elements in `ans` are the values of `sums` computed during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers that has been reversed. This means the largest elements are at the beginning of the list.
   - `sum1` is the sum of all elements in the reversed list `a`.
   - `ans` is a list that contains `k + 1` elements, where each element is a computed sum during the iterations.

3. **What is `max(ans)`?**
   - `ans` contains `k + 1` elements, each of which is a sum computed during the iterations.
   - The `max(ans)` function will return the maximum value among these `k + 1` sums.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value among the `k + 1` sums stored in the list `ans`.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the maximum value among the sums stored in the list `ans`.

Output: **max(ans) (where max(ans) is the maximum value among the k + 1 sums stored in the list ans)**
