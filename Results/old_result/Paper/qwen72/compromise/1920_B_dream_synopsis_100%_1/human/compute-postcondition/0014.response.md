The code snippet `ans.append(sums)` adds the current value of `sums` to the list `ans`. This operation modifies the list `ans` by appending one more element to it, which is the value of `sums`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a reversed list of integers, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `i` is not 0, `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`, and the current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
