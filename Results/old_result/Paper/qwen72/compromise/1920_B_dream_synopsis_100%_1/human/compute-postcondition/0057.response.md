The code snippet updates the variable `sums` by adding the value of the element at index `i - 1` in the reversed list `a`. Let's break down the changes:

- `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`.
- The value of `a[i - 1]` is the element at index `i - 1` in the reversed list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `i`, `ans`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer read from the input, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be at least 0, `x` is the third integer read from the input, `a` is a sorted list of integers read from the input but now reversed, `sum1` is the sum of the elements in the reversed `a`, `i` is not 0, `ans` is an empty list, `t - 1` iterations remain, and `sums` is updated to `sums + a[i - 1]`. Additionally, `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`.**
