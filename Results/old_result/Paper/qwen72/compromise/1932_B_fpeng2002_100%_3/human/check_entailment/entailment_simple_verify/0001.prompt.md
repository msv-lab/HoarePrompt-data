You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that the i-th sign occurs every \(a_i\) years and must occur strictly after the (i-1)-th sign.
   - The key is to determine the first year in which each sign occurs after the previous sign has occurred.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \(n\) and the list of periodicities \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\).

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program initializes `start_year` to 0, which represents the year just before the first sign occurs.
   - For each sign \(a_i\), it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur after the previous sign has occurred.
   - The formula used is `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`:
     - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the number of times the current sign has already occurred by `start_year`.
     - Adding 1 to this quotient ensures that the next occurrence is strictly after `start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the exact year of the next occurrence.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all signs for a test case, the program prints the final `start_year`, which is the year in which the n-th sign occurs.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - \(a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]\)
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Second sign: `start_year = (3 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 4`
     - Third sign: `start_year = (4 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = (8 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = (10 // 9 + 1) * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth sign: `start_year = (18 // 18 + 1) * 18 = 36`
     - Output: 36 (Correct)
   - **Example 2:**
     - \(a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\)
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - Second sign: `start_year = (1 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`
     - Third sign: `start_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 5 + 1) * 5 = 5`
     - Output: 5 (Correct)
   - **Example 3:**
     - \(a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]\)
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 1`
     - Second sign: `start_year = (1 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 2`
     - Third sign: `start_year = (2 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 3`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = (3 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 4`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = (4 // 1 + 1) * 1 = 5`
     - Output: 5 (Correct)
   - **Example 4:**
     - \(a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]\)
     - Start with `start_year = 0`.
     - First sign: `start_year = (0 // 50 + 1) * 50 = 50`
     - Second sign: `start_year = (50 // 30 + 1) * 30 = 60`
     - Third sign: `start_year = (60 // 711 + 1) * 711 = 711`
     - Fourth sign: `start_year = (711 // 200 + 1) * 200 = 800`
     - Fifth sign: `start_year = (800 // 503 + 1) * 503 = 1006`
     - Sixth sign: `start_year = (1006 // 1006 + 1) * 1006 = 2012`
     - Output: 2012 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year in which the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program.
