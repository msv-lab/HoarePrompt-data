You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is 0, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second-to-last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the third-to-last element in `nums` and so on, up to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur with a periodicity of 1. According to the problem description, if the i-th sign occurs in year x, the tribe starts waiting for the (i+1)-th sign from year x+1. However, the program does not account for this correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
1
3
1 1 1
```

The expected output is 3, as the first sign occurs in year 1, the second sign in year 2, and the third sign in year 3. However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. This is because the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not increment the year correctly when the periodicity is 1. It should be adjusted to ensure that the start year for the next sign is correctly incremented by 1.
