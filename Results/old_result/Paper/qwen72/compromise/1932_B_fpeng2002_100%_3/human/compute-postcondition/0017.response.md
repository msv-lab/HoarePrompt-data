Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the last index of `nums` (i.e., `len(nums) - 1`)**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `nums`.
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `num_tests`, `start_year`, and `x` are not directly affected by this code snippet.
- After executing the code, `nums` is updated to the list of integers provided by the user.
- The value of `x` is still the last index of `nums`, which is `len(nums) - 1`.
- The other variables remain in their initial states as specified.
