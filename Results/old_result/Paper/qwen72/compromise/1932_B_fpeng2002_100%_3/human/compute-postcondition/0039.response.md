To determine what will be printed by the `print(start_year)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\).
   - `num_tests` is an integer such that \(0 \leq num_tests <\) initial `num_tests`.
   - `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second-to-last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the third-to-last element in `nums` and so on, up to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `nums` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user.
   - `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.

2. **Understanding `start_year`:**
   - `start_year` is calculated based on the elements of `nums` in a nested manner.
   - We start from the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, which is simply 0.
   - For each subsequent element in `nums`, we find the smallest multiple of that element that is greater than or equal to the previously calculated value.

3. **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
   - Let's denote the elements of `nums` as \( \text{nums}[0], \text{nums}[1], \ldots, \text{nums}[x] \).
   - Initialize `start_year` to 0.
   - For each element from `nums[0]` to `nums[x]`:
     - Find the smallest multiple of `nums[i]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
     - Update `start_year` to this new value.

4. **Example Calculation:**
   - Suppose `nums = [2, 3, 5]`.
   - Start with `start_year = 0`.
   - For `nums[0] = 2`:
     - The smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.
   - For `nums[1] = 3`:
     - The smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.
   - For `nums[2] = 5`:
     - The smallest multiple of 5 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.

   - If `nums = [2, 3, 4]`:
   - Start with `start_year = 0`.
   - For `nums[0] = 2`:
     - The smallest multiple of 2 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.
   - For `nums[1] = 3`:
     - The smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.
   - For `nums[2] = 4`:
     - The smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.

   - If `nums = [3, 5, 7]`:
   - Start with `start_year = 0`.
   - For `nums[0] = 3`:
     - The smallest multiple of 3 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.
   - For `nums[1] = 5`:
     - The smallest multiple of 5 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.
   - For `nums[2] = 7`:
     - The smallest multiple of 7 that is greater than or equal to 0 is 0.
     - `start_year` remains 0.

5. **General Case:**
   - The smallest multiple of any integer \(a\) that is greater than or equal to 0 is always 0.
   - Therefore, regardless of the values in `nums`, `start_year` will always be 0.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(start_year)` statement will print the value of `start_year`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
