Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
while num_tests > 0:
    num_tests -= 1
    n = int(input())
    nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    start_year = 0
    for x in range(0, len(nums)):
        start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
    print(start_year)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is the last index of `nums` (i.e., `len(nums) - 1`).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `len(nums)` elements, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the product of all elements in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the initial `start_year`, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of the last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the second-to-last element in `nums` that is greater than or equal to the smallest multiple of the third-to-last element in `nums` and so on, up to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers input by the user, `x` is `len(nums) - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
