Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `num_tests` is an integer such that 0 <= num_tests < initial `num_tests`, `nums` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is 0**

Explanation:
- `start_year` is updated to the smallest multiple of `nums[0]` that is greater than or equal to 0.
- The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` calculates the next multiple of `nums[0]` after `start_year`.
- Since `start_year` is initially 0, the result of the expression is `nums[0]` because `0 // nums[0]` is 0, and `(0 + 1) * nums[0]` is `nums[0]`.
- Therefore, `start_year` is now equal to `nums[0]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
