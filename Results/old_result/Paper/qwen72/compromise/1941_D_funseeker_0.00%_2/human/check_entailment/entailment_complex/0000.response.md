### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1` reads a line from the standard input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. This is used to read the input for each test case.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases by calling `func_1` and converting the result to an integer.
   - `func_3` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into parts, and converts each part to an integer. This is used to read the values of `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - `func_4` processes each test case. It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each of the `m` throws, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c` from the input.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw. This is done by considering both clockwise and counterclockwise movements if the direction is unknown (`c == '?'`), and only the specified direction if it is known (`c == '0'` or `c == '1'`).
   - The update is performed using the modulo operation to ensure the positions wrap around the circle correctly.
   - After all throws, if `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to the set. This is because the players are numbered from 1 to `n`, and `0` should be interpreted as `n`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the number of players who could have the ball and then the numbers of these players in increasing order.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling:** The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly handle the input as described in the problem.
- **Set Initialization:** The set `ans` is correctly initialized with the starting player `x`.
- **Throw Processing:** The loop correctly processes each throw by updating the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw.
- **Modulo Operation:** The modulo operation is used correctly to handle the circular nature of the game.
- **Final Adjustment:** The final adjustment to replace `0` with `n` is necessary and correctly implemented.
- **Output:** The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles all edge cases as required.

### Correctness:
**True**
