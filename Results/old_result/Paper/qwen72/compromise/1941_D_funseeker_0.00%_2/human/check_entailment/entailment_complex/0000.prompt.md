Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

throw are highlighted in gray.

# Annotated Functions:
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

sys.setrecursionlimit(100000000)
t = func_2()
for i in range(t):
    func_4()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()
    #The program returns a string that is the first line of input read from the standard input, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads the first line of input from the standard input, removes any leading and trailing whitespace, and returns the resulting string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are relevant to the problem description.
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())
    #The program returns an integer value that is the result of calling `func_1()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value obtained from calling `func_1`. After the function concludes, the program state is unchanged except for the returned integer value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each part to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_1()` and converting each part to an integer.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n.
def func_4():
    n, m, x = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        r, c = func_1().split()
        
        r = int(r)
        
        temp = set()
        
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        
        ans = temp
        
    #State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, for all iterations of the loop. `c`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` is the final value of the range, which is `m - 1`.
    if (0 in ans) :
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    #State: *`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, for all iterations of the loop. If `0` is in `ans`, the value `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. `c`, `r`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `_` is the final value of the range, which is `m - 1`.
    print(len(ans))
    #This is printed: len(ans) (where `ans` is the set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, with `0` removed and `n` added if `0` was present, after `m` iterations of the loop)
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 1 2 3 4 5 (where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are the unique values in the final `ans` set after the loop and condition check)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It initializes a set `ans` with a single element `x`, where `x` is an integer between 1 and `n`. It then iterates `m` times, where `m` is an integer between 1 and 1000. In each iteration, it processes a pair `(r, c)` where `r` is an integer and `c` is a string. Based on the value of `c`, it updates `ans` to include all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`. After the loop, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`. Finally, the function prints the size of `ans` and all elements in `ans`.
