Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is either '1' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q - r) % n`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- Since `temp` was initially an empty set, it now contains the value `(q - r) % n`.
- The value of `c` remains either '1' or '?', as it is not modified by the code.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `_`, `r`) remain unchanged.
