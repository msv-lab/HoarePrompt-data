Output State: **`r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in the original `ans`. `temp` is an empty set. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp = set()` initializes `temp` as an empty set.
- The values of `r`, `c`, `ans`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `m` must be greater than the current value of `_` is still valid.
- `temp` is now an empty set, as it was explicitly set to an empty set by the code.
