Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x` and at least one more element, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is either '0', '1', or '?', `temp` is a set containing the values `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', and now also contains the value `(q + r) % n`. `q` is the next element in the set `ans`.**

In natural language: The code adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are still the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` is still greater than 0, `ans` still contains the value of `x` and at least one more element, `_` remains 0, `r` is still the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, and `c` is still either '0', '1', or '?'. The set `temp` now contains the value `(q + r) % n` in addition to its previous contents. `q` is still the next element in the set `ans`.
