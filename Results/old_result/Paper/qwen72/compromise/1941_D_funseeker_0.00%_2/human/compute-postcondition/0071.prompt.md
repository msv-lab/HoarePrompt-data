Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans`, depending on the value of `c`, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is either '0', '1', or '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ans` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in the original `ans`. `temp` is the final set of values after all iterations, and it contains all the unique results of the operations performed on each `q` in `ans`. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is an integer, `c` is unchanged, `ans` is a set containing the unique values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `ans` contains only the unique values `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'. `c`, `r`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `m` must be greater than the current value of `_`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
