To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `q` and the set `ans`.

1. **Variable `q`**: This variable will be assigned the values from the set `ans` during each iteration of the loop. It does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
2. **Set `ans`**: The loop will execute if `ans` contains at least one element. The state before the loop starts indicates that `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`. For the loop to execute, `ans` must not be empty.

Given the state before the loop starts, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`. This implies that `ans` is not empty, which is sufficient for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. The current state is already sufficient.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `m` must be greater than 0, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`, `_` is 0, `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is an empty set.**
