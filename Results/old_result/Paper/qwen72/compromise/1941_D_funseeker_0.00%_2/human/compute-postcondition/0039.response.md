Output State: **`ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the second element in `ans`, `temp` contains an additional element which is `(q - r) % n`.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. The initial state specifies that if `c` is '1' or any other value, `temp` should contain an additional element which is `(q - r) % n`. Since the code adds `(q - r) % n` to `temp`, this condition is met. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
