Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer n as input, where 1 <= n <= 50, and return a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, or "NO" if no such string exists.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The function will print "NO" for any odd value of `n` and "YES" followed by a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times for any even value of `n` where the length of the string is less than 200. If `n` is even but the length of the string is 200 or more, it will print "NO". The loop will execute `t` times, and the state of `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from the input. If `n` is odd or if the length of the string formed by repeating '110' `n // 2` times is 200 or more, the function prints "NO". If `n` is even and the length of the string is less than 200, the function prints "YES" followed by the string. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The state of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution.
