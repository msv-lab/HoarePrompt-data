Output State: **`n` and `t` retain their initial values, `edges` remains an empty list, `nodes` is now a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, populated with the edges provided by the input, `start` retains its initial value, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is now an empty deque.**

The code initializes `leaves` as an empty deque, which is a double-ended queue. All other variables retain their initial values and states.
