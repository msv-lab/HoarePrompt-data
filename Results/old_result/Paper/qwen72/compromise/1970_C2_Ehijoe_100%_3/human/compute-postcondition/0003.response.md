Output State: **`n` and `t` are reassigned the values from the input split by space, `edges` is an empty list, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `empty` is True, `nodes` is now a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The initial state is updated such that `nodes` is now a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory, meaning that any new key added to `nodes` will automatically have a default value of an empty list. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `start`, and `empty`) remain unchanged.
