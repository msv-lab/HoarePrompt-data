### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game is played on a tree with `n` nodes.
   - Each round starts with a stone on a specific node, which is considered activated.
   - Players alternate moves, moving the stone to an inactive neighbor.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
   - The game is played for `t` rounds, but in this problem, `t` is always 1.
   - The goal is to determine who wins the round if both players play optimally.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function is a recursive function that checks if the player starting from the `start` node can force a win.
     - It returns `False` if the `start` node is a leaf node (i.e., it has only one neighbor, which is the `parent`).
     - It recursively checks the distances of all adjacent nodes (excluding the `parent`).
     - It returns `True` if any of these recursive checks return `False`, indicating that there is at least one path from the `start` node to a leaf node that does not include the `parent`.
     - If all recursive checks return `True`, it means the `start` node is part of a subtree where every path leads to a leaf node that can be reached by the opponent, and thus the function returns `False`.

   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the input and constructs the tree.
     - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a `deque` called `leaves`.
     - It reads the starting node for the round and calls `func_1` with the constructed tree and the starting node.
     - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "Ron", indicating that Ron can force a win.
     - If `func_1` returns `False`, it prints "Hermione", indicating that Hermione can force a win.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - In a tree, the player who starts from a node with an even number of moves to a leaf node can always force a win by playing optimally.
   - The function `func_1` essentially checks if the starting node has an odd number of moves to a leaf node. If it does, `func_1` returns `False`, and Hermione wins. If it has an even number of moves, `func_1` returns `True`, and Ron wins.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the starting node is a leaf node by returning `False` immediately.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the starting node is not a leaf node by recursively checking the distances to leaf nodes.

5. **Overall Behavior**:
   - The program reads the input, constructs the tree, and determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
   - The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the problem's requirements and should correctly determine the winner for any valid input.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. It correctly identifies the winner of the game by checking the structure of the tree and the starting node.

Correctness: **True**
