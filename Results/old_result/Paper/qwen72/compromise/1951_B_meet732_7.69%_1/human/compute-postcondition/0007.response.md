To determine what will be printed by the `print(ind)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant information:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `ind` is a list containing the indices of the first two cows in the list `a` whose Cowdeforces ratings are greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`.
   - `c` is 2.
   - The list `a` remains unchanged.
   - The value of `x` remains the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k`.
   - The current value of `k` is 14.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `a` is a list of Cowdeforces ratings.
   - `k` is an index in the list `a`, and its value is 14.
   - `x` is the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k` in the list `a`.
   - `ind` is a list that contains the indices of the first two cows in `a` whose ratings are greater than `x`.

3. **Determine the Values**:
   - The value of `x` is `a[14]`.
   - `ind` is a list of indices where the ratings are greater than `a[14]`.

Since the exact values of the list `a` are not provided, we cannot determine the specific numerical indices in `ind`. However, based on the initial state, we know that `ind` contains the indices of the first two cows whose ratings are greater than the rating of the cow at index 14.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(ind)` statement will print the list `ind`, which contains the indices of the first two cows in the list `a` whose ratings are greater than the rating of the cow at index 14.

Output: **[ind] (where ind is a list containing the indices of the first two cows in the list `a` whose Cowdeforces ratings are greater than the rating of the cow at index 14)**
