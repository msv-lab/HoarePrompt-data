Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where n is the number of cows, and each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow. The ratings are distinct and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. `x` is equal to the Cowdeforces rating of the cow at index `k` in the list `a`. `ind` is an empty list. `c` is 0.** 

The variable `c` is initialized to 0. The other variables (`a`, `x`, and `ind`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
