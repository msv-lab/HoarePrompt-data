Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between `ind[0] - 1` and `ind[1] - ind[0]`. `ind[0]` is the index of the first cow in the list `a` whose Cowdeforces rating is greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`, and `ind[1]` is the index of the second cow in the list `a` whose Cowdeforces rating is greater than the rating of the cow at index `k`. Since `k` is 14 and `k` is greater than the second element of `ind`, both `ind[0]` and `ind[1]` are less than 14. The first element of `ind` is not 0.**
