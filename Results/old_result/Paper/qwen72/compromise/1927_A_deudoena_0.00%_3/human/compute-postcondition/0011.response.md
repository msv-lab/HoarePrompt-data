The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', with at least one 'B'. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information. However, based on the constraints, we can infer that the function likely processes the string `s` in some way, possibly related to the integer `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n`, an integer between 1 and 10, and `s`, a string of length `n` containing at least one 'B' and consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided.**
