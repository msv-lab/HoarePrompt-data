You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Annotated Code:

    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white.
   - The segment should cover all black cells, and it should be the smallest possible segment that does so.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads a single string `inpstr` representing the strip of cells.
   - It initializes three variables: `ind1`, `ind2`, and `outind` to 0.
   - The first loop (`for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr)`) finds the index of the first black cell (`'B'`) in the string and assigns it to `ind1`.
   - The second loop (`for i in range(len(inpstr))`) finds the index of the last black cell (`'B'`) in the string from the end and assigns it to `ind2`.
   - Finally, it calculates the length of the segment to be painted as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` and prints it.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
   - The logic for finding the minimum segment length is incorrect. The correct length should be the distance between the first and last black cells plus one, not `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - To find the minimum segment length, we need to:
     - Identify the index of the first black cell (`ind1`).
     - Identify the index of the last black cell (`ind2`).
     - The minimum segment length is `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.

5. **Corrected Program:**
   - The program should read the number of test cases and then process each test case.
   - For each test case, it should find the first and last black cells and calculate the minimum segment length correctly.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def solve_test_case(n, s):
    ind1 = s.find('B')
    ind2 = s.rfind('B')
    return ind2 - ind1 + 1

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        print(solve_test_case(n, s))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- `s.find('B')` finds the index of the first black cell.
- `s.rfind('B')` finds the index of the last black cell.
- The minimum segment length is calculated as `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.
- The program processes multiple test cases as required.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases and has a logical error in calculating the segment length.

Correctness: **False**
