Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the input format correctly as specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the input will consist of multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` followed by a string `s` of length `n`. However, the provided program only reads a single string and does not account for the number of test cases or the length of the strip. This means the program will fail to process the input correctly for the given format.

Additionally, the logic for finding the minimum length of the segment to be painted is flawed. The program calculates the indices of the first and last 'B' characters and then prints the length of the segment between them. This approach does not always yield the correct minimum length, especially when there are multiple segments of black cells that need to be considered.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
WBBWBW
```
The program will output `4`, which is correct for this specific case. However, for the input:
```
1
4
BWWB
```
The program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because painting the segment from the 1st to the 1st cell (or the 4th to the 4th cell) is sufficient to make the entire strip white.
