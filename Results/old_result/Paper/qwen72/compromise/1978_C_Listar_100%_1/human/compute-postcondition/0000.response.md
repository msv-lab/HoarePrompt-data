Output State: **`n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_4()`.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_4()`. The precondition that `n` and `k` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12 remains valid after the execution of the code.
