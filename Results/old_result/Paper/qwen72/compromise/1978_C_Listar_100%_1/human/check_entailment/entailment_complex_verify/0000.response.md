### Reasoning:

1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k` is 0. In `func_1`, if `k` becomes 0 during the iteration, the function returns the list `l` which is the identity permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum `k`**:
   - The original assessment states that the maximum possible `k` for a permutation of length `n` is `n * (n - 1)`. However, this is incorrect. The maximum Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is actually `n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is because the maximum value for each term `|p_i - i|` is `n - 1`, and there are `n` such terms. The sum of the maximum values for all terms is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - The program in `func_4` correctly calculates the maximum `k` as `(n ** 2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `n ** 2 // 2` for even `n`. This is equivalent to `n * (n - 1) // 2` for both cases.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The swapping logic in `func_2` and `func_3` is designed to adjust the permutation to achieve the desired `k`. The function `func_2` swaps elements at positions `-c - k` and `-c` to reduce `k` by a smaller amount, while `func_3` swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` to reduce `k` by a larger amount.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that `k` is reduced correctly by either calling `func_2` or `func_3` based on the current value of `k` and the iteration step. This approach is valid for generating a permutation with the required Manhattan value.

4. **Incorrect Return Values**:
   - The function `func_4` returns `(0, 0)` when `k` is odd or when `k` exceeds the maximum possible value. This is a valid approach because the problem description requires printing "No" in such cases. The function `func_6` correctly prints "No" when `n` is 0.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_6` is called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, as described in the problem. The input handling is correct, and the program processes each test case independently.

### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case**: `n = 3`, `k = 4`
  - **Expected Output**:
    ```
    Yes
    3 1 2
    ```
  - **Actual Output**:
    - The program correctly identifies that `k` is even and within the maximum possible value.
    - `func_1` generates the permutation `[3, 1, 2]` which has a Manhattan value of `|3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4`.
    - The output is:
      ```
      Yes
      3 1 2
      ```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect in several points:
- The maximum `k` calculation was misstated.
- The program correctly handles the case where `k` is 0.
- The swapping logic in `func_2` and `func_3` is designed to achieve the desired `k` and is valid.
- The input handling and return values are consistent with the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct for the problem described.
