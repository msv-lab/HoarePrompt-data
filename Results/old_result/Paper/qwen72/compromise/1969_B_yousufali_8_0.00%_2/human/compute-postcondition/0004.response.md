Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, and then calls the function `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the integer `t` remains unchanged, and `func_1` has been executed `t` times. **
