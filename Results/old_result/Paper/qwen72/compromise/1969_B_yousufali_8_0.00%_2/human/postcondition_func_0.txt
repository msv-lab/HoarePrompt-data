The function `func_1` reads a binary string represented as a list of integers (0s and 1s) from the user input. It calculates a value `ans` which is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 encountered after a 1, where `n` is the count of 1s seen so far. The function then prints the value of `ans`. The list `s` remains unchanged after the function execution.
