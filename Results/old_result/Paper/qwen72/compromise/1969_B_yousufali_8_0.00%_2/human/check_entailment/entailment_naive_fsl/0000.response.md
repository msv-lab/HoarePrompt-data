Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the input and output as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` is reading the input string as a list of integers, which is incorrect because the input is a binary string, not a list of integers. Additionally, the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the string is already sorted, and it does not correctly compute the minimum total cost to sort the string. 

For example, consider the input "10":
- The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem description.
- However, the program will read "10" as a list of integers `[1, 0]` and will not correctly compute the cost.

Another example is the input "0000":
- The correct output should be 0, as the string is already sorted.
- The program will incorrectly compute the cost because it does not handle this case properly.

The program needs to be revised to correctly parse the input as a string and implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string using the specified cyclic shift operation.
