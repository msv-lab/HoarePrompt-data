You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function reads input directly, which is expected to be a binary string represented as a list of integers (0s and 1s).
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):

        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
        
    #State: `s` remains unchanged, `n` is the number of 1s in the list `s`, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 encountered after a 1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the sum of `n + 1` for each 0 encountered after a 1 in the list `s`.
    #
    #Output:

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: The loop has executed `func_1` `t` times. No variables are passed to the function `func_2`, and `t` remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum cost. The cost of a cyclic shift operation on a substring is equal to the length of the substring.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of all operations required to sort the string.

2. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the processing of a single binary string.
   - The function starts by converting the input string into a list of integers. However, the input is read using `input().split()`, which is incorrect for a binary string. Binary strings should be read as a single string and then converted to a list of integers.
   - The variable `n` is used to count the number of 1s encountered.
   - The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the cost of the operations.
   - The loop iterates through the string, and for each 0 encountered after at least one 1, it adds `n + 1` to the cost. This is because each 0 encountered after a 1 indicates that the 1s need to be moved to the left, and the cost of moving a block of `n` 1s is `n + 1` (the length of the substring including the 0).

3. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` is supposed to handle multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The issue with `func_1` is that it reads the input string in an incorrect way, which will cause the program to fail when processing the binary strings.

4. **Correctness of Input Handling:**
   - The input handling in `func_1` is incorrect. It should read the binary string as a single string and then convert it to a list of integers.
   - The correct way to read the binary string is `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))`.

5. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost to sort the binary string. It correctly identifies the cost of moving 1s to the left of 0s.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the input handling issue in `func_1`. The function `func_1` should read the binary string as a single string and then convert it to a list of integers.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == 1:
            n += 1
        if s[i] == 0 and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem.
