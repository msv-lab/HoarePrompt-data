The function `testcase` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input values that conform to the problem's specifications: the first line contains two integers n and t, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5 and t=1, representing the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The following n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, representing an edge between nodes u and v in the tree. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves. The last line contains a single integer u_1, where 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, representing the starting node for the round.
