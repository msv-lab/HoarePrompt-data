You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but the problem description implies that the input is provided externally and consists of: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in the tree, and a list of n-1 pairs of integers (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing the edges of the tree, and an integer u_1 (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        if empty:
            tree.append(u)
            tree.append(v)
            empty = False
        elif v == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers that represent a sequence where each pair `(u, v)` from the input is added to the deque based on the conditions in the loop, and `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` is a deque containing integers, `empty` is False if at least one pair was added to the deque, otherwise it remains True, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in the deque `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`. If at least one element in `moves` is odd, the condition is met. Otherwise, all elements in `moves` are even.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates on an external input consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of the tree, and an integer `u_1` (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n) representing the starting node for the round. The function returns the result of some operation based on these inputs, which is not specified in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
