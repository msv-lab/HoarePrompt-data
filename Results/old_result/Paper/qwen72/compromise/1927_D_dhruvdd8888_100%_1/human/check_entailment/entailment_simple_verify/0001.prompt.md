You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to read input from stdin and process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. The array `a` has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The number of queries `q` for each test case is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5). Each query is defined by two integers `l` and `r` (1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The sum of `n` and `q` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
   - It initializes variables `s`, `e`, and `num` to keep track of the start of a segment, the end of a segment, and the current number, respectively.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the last segment correctly.
   - It iterates through the array and groups consecutive identical numbers into segments, storing the start and end indices of each segment along with the number in the list `arr`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of queries and processes each query.
   - For each query, it uses `bisect_left` to find the first segment that starts at or after the query's left boundary `l`.
   - It then checks the start and end indices of the segment to determine if a valid pair of indices `i` and `j` can be found within the query range `[l, r]`.

4. **Conditions for Valid Pairs:**
   - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1 or greater than `r`. If so, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found). Otherwise, it prints `s-1` and `s` (valid pair found).
   - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found).
   - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N` or `l`, it prints `s` and `e+1` (valid pair found).
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1` (no valid pair found).

### Analysis of Conditions:
- The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers.
- The use of `bisect_left` ensures efficient querying of the segments.
- The conditions for checking valid pairs are logically sound, but there are some issues:
  - The condition `if s > l` should be checked more carefully to ensure that the segment starts within the query range.
  - The condition `elif e >= r` should be `elif e < r` to ensure that the segment ends within the query range.
  - The condition `elif e < N or e < l` is redundant and can be simplified.

### Correctness:
- The program does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the segment boundaries do not align perfectly with the query boundaries.
- The logic for determining valid pairs is flawed in some cases, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Example of Incorrect Output:
- For the query `(1, 2)` in the array `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`, the program should output `-1 -1` because there are no different elements in the range `[1, 2]`. However, the program might output a valid pair due to incorrect boundary checks.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine valid pairs of indices, leading to incorrect outputs in some cases.
