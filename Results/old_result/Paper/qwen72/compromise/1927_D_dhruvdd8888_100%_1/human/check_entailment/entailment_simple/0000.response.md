### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Segment Identification**:
   - The program appends `-1` to `nums` to handle the end of the array.
   - It then iterates through `nums` to identify segments of consecutive identical numbers and stores the start and end indices of these segments in `arr`.
   - The tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` is appended to `arr` whenever a different number is encountered, ensuring that `arr` contains the start and end indices of each segment.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the leftmost segment that starts at or after the query's start index `l`.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if there are any different elements within the query range:
     - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is within the query range and prints the appropriate indices.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1, -1` because the segment extends beyond the query range.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N` or `l`, it prints the appropriate indices.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1, -1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the array has only one unique element by appending `-1` to `nums` and ensuring that `arr` is not empty.
   - It also handles the case where the query range is entirely within a single segment of identical numbers by printing `-1, -1`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the required indices or `-1, -1` for each query, which matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and edge cases. However, there is a potential issue in the logic for handling the query ranges and segment boundaries. Specifically, the conditions for determining if a pair of different elements exists within the query range might not be robust enough.

### Detailed Analysis:
- **Segment Identification**:
  - The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers and stores them in `arr`.
  - The segment boundaries are correctly calculated and stored.

- **Query Processing**:
  - The use of `bisect_left` to find the leftmost segment starting at or after `l` is correct.
  - The conditions for checking if the segment boundaries are within the query range are not entirely correct:
    - The condition `if s > l` should be `if s <= r` to ensure that the segment is within the query range.
    - The condition `elif e >= r` should be `elif e < r` to ensure that the segment does not extend beyond the query range.
    - The condition `elif e < N or e < l` is redundant and should be removed.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

tc = int(input())
for ppp in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    N = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = 0
    num = nums[0]
    arr = []
    nums.append(-1)
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if nums[i] != num:
            arr.append((1 + s, i, num))
            s = i
        num = nums[i]
    
    LA = len(arr) - 1
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
        
        if eli < LA:
            s, e, _ = arr[eli]
            if s <= r:
                print(s - 1, s)
            else:
                print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(-1, -1)
```

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical issues in the query processing part, which can lead to incorrect outputs for some queries. The corrected code should be used to ensure the program is correct.
