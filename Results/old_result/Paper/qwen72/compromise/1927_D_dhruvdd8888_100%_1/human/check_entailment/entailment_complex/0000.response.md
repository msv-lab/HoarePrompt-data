Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
   - It initializes variables `s` and `e` to 0, and `num` to the first element of `nums`.
   - It appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the end of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to create a list `arr` of tuples, where each tuple represents the start and end indices of segments of consecutive identical numbers in `nums`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - It reads the number of queries `q` for the current test case.
   - For each query, it reads the range `[l, r]`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the conditions to determine if a valid pair of indices exists within the range `[l, r]`:
     - If the start of the segment `s` is greater than `l`, it checks if `s` is 1 or greater than `r`. If so, it prints `(-1, -1)`. Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If the end of the segment `e` is less than `N` or less than `l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs pairs of indices or `(-1, -1)` based on the conditions.

However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

- **Segment Identification**:
  - The segment identification logic is flawed. The tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` is not correctly capturing the end of the segment. The end index should be `i - 1` instead of `i` to correctly represent the last index of the segment.
  - The logic for determining if a valid pair exists within the range `[l, r]` is also flawed. The conditions are not correctly handling all possible cases.

- **Correct Logic**:
  - The correct approach would be to use a set to track unique elements within the range `[l, r]` for each query. If the set contains more than one unique element, then a valid pair exists. Otherwise, it does not.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
