Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case includes an array `a` of integers and a series of queries. For each query defined by two integers `l` and `r`, the function processes the array to find and print a pair of indices representing the boundaries of a segment of consecutive identical numbers that intersects with the range `[l, r]`. If no such segment exists, it prints `(-1, -1)`. After processing all queries, the function leaves the input array `nums` and other internal variables unchanged. **
