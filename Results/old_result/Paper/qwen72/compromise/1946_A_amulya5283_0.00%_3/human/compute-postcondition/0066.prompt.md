Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are strictly greater than `current_median`, `operations` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while heap[0] <= current_median:
    smallest = heapq.heappop(heap)
    heapq.heappush(heap, smallest + 1)
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, but the first element (which was equal to `current_median`) has been removed and `smallest + 1` has been added, `smallest` is the value of `current_median`, `operations` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, but the first element (which was equal to `current_median`) has been removed and `smallest + 1` has been added twice, `smallest` is the second smallest value in the original heap (which was the value of `current_median` before the first element was removed and `smallest + 1` was added), `operations` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, but the first element (which was equal to `current_median`) has been removed and `smallest + 1` has been added three times, `smallest` is the second smallest value in the original heap (which was the value of `current_median` before the first element was removed and `smallest + 1` was added), `operations` is 3, `smallest + 1` must be less than or equal to `current_median`, and `smallest` is now the third smallest value in the original heap.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
