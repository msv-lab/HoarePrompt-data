To ensure the `while` loop can execute its first iteration, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head: `heap[0] <= current_median`.

Given the program state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `test_cases` is a list of t tuples
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended
- `i` is 2
- `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`
- `arr` is now sorted
- `median_index` is `n // 2`
- `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`
- `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are strictly greater than `current_median`
- `operations` is 0

The condition `heap[0] <= current_median` must be true for the loop to execute. However, the given state indicates that `heap` contains elements that are strictly greater than `current_median`. This means that `heap[0]` (the smallest element in the heap) is already greater than `current_median`, and the loop condition would be false.

To make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust the state so that `heap[0]` is less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap` is a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from `median_index` to the end, and all elements are strictly greater than `current_median`, the only way to adjust this is to change the value of `heap[0]` to be less than or equal to `current_median`.

However, we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case are `heap[0]` and `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is derived from the heap and `current_median` is derived from `arr`, we cannot directly change their values. Instead, we need to ensure that the heap contains an element that is less than or equal to `current_median`.

Given the constraints, we can adjust the state of `heap` to include an element that is less than or equal to `current_median`. For simplicity, we can assume that the first element of the heap (`heap[0]`) is adjusted to be equal to `current_median`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` appended, `i` is 2, `n` is the first element of the third tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is now sorted, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where `heap[0]` is equal to `current_median`, `operations` is 0**
