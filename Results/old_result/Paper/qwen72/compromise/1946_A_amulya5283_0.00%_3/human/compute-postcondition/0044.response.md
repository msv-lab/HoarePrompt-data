Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is 1, `n` is the first element of the second tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the second tuple in `test_cases` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted `arr`, `heap` is now a min-heap containing elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, where all elements are strictly greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as the smallest element in the heap is less than or equal to the `current_median`.
- Each iteration of the loop pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap.
- The variable `operations` keeps track of the number of times the loop has executed.
- After all iterations, the heap will contain elements that are strictly greater than `current_median`, and `operations` will be the total number of increments performed.
- The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
