Output State: **The loop continues to execute until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The `heap` will contain elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, but any elements that were equal to or less than `current_median` will have been incremented by 1 as many times as necessary to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`. The `operations` variable will contain the total number of increments performed. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the loop will keep running as long as the smallest element in the heap is less than or equal to the current median. Each time the loop runs, it removes the smallest element from the heap, increments it by 1, and pushes it back into the heap. This process continues until the smallest element in the heap is strictly greater than the current median. The `operations` variable keeps track of how many times this increment operation has been performed. The final state of the `heap` will have all elements greater than `current_median`, and `operations` will reflect the total number of increments needed to achieve this. All other variables remain the same as they were in the initial state.
