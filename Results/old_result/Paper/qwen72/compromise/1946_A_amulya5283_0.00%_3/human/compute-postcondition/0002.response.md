Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`.** 

The code assigns the first element of the tuple at index 0 in `test_cases` to `n` and the second element of the same tuple to `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
