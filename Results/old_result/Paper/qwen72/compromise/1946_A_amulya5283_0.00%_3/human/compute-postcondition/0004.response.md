Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `arr` is the sorted version of the second element of the first tuple in `test_cases`, `median_index` is `n // 2`.**

The variable `median_index` is calculated as the integer division of `n` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
