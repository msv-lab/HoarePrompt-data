Output State: **The loop continues to execute until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median. The `heap` will contain elements from `arr` starting from index `median_index` to the end, but any elements that were equal to or less than `current_median` will have been incremented by 1 as many times as necessary to ensure that the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`. The `operations` variable will contain the total number of increments performed. The `results` list now includes the value of `operations`. All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, `current_median`) remain unchanged.**
