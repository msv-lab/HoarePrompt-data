### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
   - It then enters a loop that increments `count` from 2 to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1`.
   - It computes `g` as `n / count` and checks if `g` is less than `countmins`. If so, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` from it and adds \((g / count) + 1\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the integer value of `ans`.

3. **Logical Flaws**:
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`, which is not necessarily the correct starting point for the count of valid pairs.
   - The loop condition and the way `g` is calculated and updated do not seem to align with the problem's requirement of checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly account for the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition for each pair.
   - However, the given program does not perform this check and instead uses a series of operations that do not directly relate to the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and the way the variables are updated do not align with the necessary conditions for the pairs \((a, b)\).

### Correctness:
**False**
