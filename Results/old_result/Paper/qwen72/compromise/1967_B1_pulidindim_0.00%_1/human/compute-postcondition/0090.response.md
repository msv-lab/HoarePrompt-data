Output State: **`n` and `m` are updated to the values provided by the user, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 3 + 1 + g / 3 + 1 + g / count + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is equal to `n / 4 - 3`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values.**
