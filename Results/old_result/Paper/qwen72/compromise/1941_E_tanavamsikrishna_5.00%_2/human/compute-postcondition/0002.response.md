Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers provided by the input, `rows` is now a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers as provided by the input, where `a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0` and `0 ≤ a_{i,j} ≤ 10^6` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n` and `1 ≤ j ≤ m`. `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.**
