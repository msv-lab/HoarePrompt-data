### Reasoning:

Let's break down the original assessment and the annotated code to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). Specifically, the function `func_1` is said to incorrectly assume that the minimum cost for each cell can be calculated by only considering the previous \(d+1\) cells, which does not account for the correct distance constraint between supports.

#### Annotated Code:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - **Initial State:** `row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a single row of the river grid, and `d` is a positive integer such that \(1 \le d \le \text{len(row)}\).
   - **First Loop:** The first \(d-1\) elements of the `row` list are incremented by 1. This is correct because the first \(d-1\) cells must have supports, and each support installation costs \(a_{i,j} + 1\).
   - **Second Loop:** For each subsequent element from \(d-1\) to the end of the list, the element is updated to the minimum of the previous \(d\) elements (including the first \(d-1\) elements and the updated elements) plus the original value of that element plus 1. This is intended to ensure that the distance constraint is met, but it does not correctly handle the distance constraint.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - **Initial State:** `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are integers such that \(1 \le k \le n \le 100\), \(3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le d \le m\). `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers where \(a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0\) and \(0 \le a_{i,j} \le 10^6\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\) and \(1 \le j \le m\).
   - **Cost Calculation:** The function computes the cost for each row using `func_1` and stores these costs in a list `costs`.
   - **Total Cost Calculation:** The function calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements in `costs` and stores these sums in a list `total_costs`.
   - **Output:** The function prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.

#### Analysis:
- **Distance Constraint Handling:**
  - The second loop in `func_1` is intended to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than \(d\). However, it does not correctly handle this constraint. The loop calculates the minimum cost for each cell by considering the minimum of the previous \(d\) cells, but it does not ensure that the distance between supports is exactly \(d\) or less.
  - For example, in the provided test case:
    ```
    1
    3 5 1 2
    0 1 0 1 0
    0 2 2 2 0
    0 3 3 3 0
    ```
    - The correct output should be 4, as the minimum cost of building a bridge in the first row is 4 (installing supports at columns 1, 3, and 5).
    - However, the program will output 6 because it incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for the middle cells without considering the correct distance constraint.

- **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
  - A correct approach would involve dynamic programming to ensure that the distance constraint is met. For each cell, you would need to consider the minimum cost of installing a support in the previous \(d\) cells and ensure that the distance between supports is no more than \(d\).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the distance constraint between supports, leading to incorrect cost calculations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
