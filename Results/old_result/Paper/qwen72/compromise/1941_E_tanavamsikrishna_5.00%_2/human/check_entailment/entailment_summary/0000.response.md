### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid with `n` rows and `m` columns.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**:
     - This function processes a single row to determine the minimum cost of installing supports.
     - It increments the first `d-1` elements by 1, which accounts for the cost of installing supports in the first `d-1` columns.
     - For each subsequent element from `d-1` to the end of the row, it updates the element to the minimum of the previous `d` elements (including the first `d-1` elements and the updated elements) plus the original value of that element plus 1. This ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
     - The function returns the last element of the updated `row` list, which represents the minimum cost of installing supports for that row.

   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the input for a test case.
     - It processes `n` rows of the grid using `func_1` to compute the cost for each row.
     - It then calculates the sum of every `k` consecutive elements in the `costs` list, which represents the total cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
     - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which is the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` bridges.

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The input format is correctly handled by `func_2`.
   - The output format is also correct, as it prints the minimum total cost for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the edge case where the row has fewer than `d` elements.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the edge case where `k` is 1, as it will simply return the minimum cost of a single row.

5. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The algorithm in `func_1` ensures that the cost of installing supports is minimized by dynamically choosing the minimum cost from the previous `d` elements.
   - The algorithm in `func_2` correctly sums the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes each row to find the minimum cost of installing supports and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.

Correctness: **True**
