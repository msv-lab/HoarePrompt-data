### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of a grid, with each bridge having supports installed in the first and last columns, and ensuring that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost of installing supports for all `k` bridges.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost to build a bridge on a single row.
   - The function iterates through the row and updates the cost of each cell to include the cost of installing a support.
   - For the first `d-1` cells, it simply adds 1 to the depth.
   - For the remaining cells, it finds the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds the current cell's depth plus 1.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell, which represents the minimum cost to build the bridge on that row.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input for each test case, including the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid and processes each row using `func_1` to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The output is the minimum total cost for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `d` is 1, meaning supports must be installed in every cell.
   - The function also handles the edge case where `d` is large enough to cover the entire row, meaning supports can be installed only at the river banks.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of columns.
   - The time complexity of `func_2` is `O(t * n * m)`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of rows, and `m` is the number of columns.
   - This is efficient given the constraints.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function correctly updates the cost for the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to the depth.
  - For the remaining cells, it correctly finds the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` cells (excluding the current cell) and adds the current cell's depth plus 1.
  - The function returns the cost of the last cell, which is the minimum cost to build the bridge on that row.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It correctly calculates the cost for each row using `func_1`.
  - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
  - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows.

### Potential Issues:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
  - The function updates the cost for the first `d-1` cells correctly.
  - However, the logic for updating the cost of the remaining cells might be flawed. Specifically, the line:
    ```python
    row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
    ```
    should be:
    ```python
    row[i] = min(row[max(0, i - d):i]) + row[i] + 1
    ```
    This ensures that the minimum cost is taken from the previous `d` cells, not `d+1` cells.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
  - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - The logic for calculating the total cost for `k` consecutive bridges is correct.
  - The output is correctly formatted and matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was mostly accurate, but there is a minor issue in `func_1` where the range for the minimum cost calculation should be adjusted. This issue could affect the correctness of the solution for some test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the minor issue in `func_1` that affects the calculation of the minimum cost for building a bridge on a single row. This needs to be fixed to ensure the program works correctly for all test cases.
