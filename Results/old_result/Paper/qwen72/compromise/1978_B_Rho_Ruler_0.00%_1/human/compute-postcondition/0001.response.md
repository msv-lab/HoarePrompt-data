Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are positive integers, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, `ans` is `k * b`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to `k * b`, where `k` is an integer between 0 and the minimum of `n` and `b`, and `b` is a positive integer. The other variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.
