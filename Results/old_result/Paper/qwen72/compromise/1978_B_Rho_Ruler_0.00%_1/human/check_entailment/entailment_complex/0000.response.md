### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Approach**: The program uses a binary search approach to find the optimal value of `k`. The variable `low` is initialized to 0 and `high` to `n`. The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`. This is a standard binary search setup.

2. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if a given `k` value is valid. However, the function's logic is flawed:
   - It calculates `ans` as `k * b + (n - k) * a`, which is the total profit if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The function then returns `True` if `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition is always true because `n * max(a, b)` is the maximum possible profit Bob can get by selling all buns at the higher of the two prices (`a` or `b`). Therefore, the function will always return `True`, which means the binary search will always set `ans` to the highest possible value of `k` (i.e., `n`).

3. **Output**: The program prints the value of `ans`, which is the highest value of `k` that was tested. However, the problem requires the maximum profit, not the value of `k`.

4. **Correct Output Calculation**: The correct output should be the maximum profit, which can be calculated as `k * b + (n - k) * a` for the optimal `k`. The program does not calculate this profit and instead prints `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not compute the maximum profit as required by the problem statement. It only finds the highest possible value of `k` and prints it, which is not the desired output.

### Correctness:
**False**
