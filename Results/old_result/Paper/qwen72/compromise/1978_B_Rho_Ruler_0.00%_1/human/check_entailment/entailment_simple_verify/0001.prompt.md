You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Bob has `n` buns to sell.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing the optimal `k`.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The program uses a binary search to find the optimal `k`.
   - The binary search is performed on the range `[0, n]`.
   - The function `func_1(k, a, b, n)` is used to determine if the chosen `k` is valid.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the total profit if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - It then checks if this total profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.
   - The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not the correct condition to determine the optimal `k`. Instead, the function should return the maximum profit directly.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is used to find the maximum `k` that satisfies the condition.
   - However, the condition used in `func_1` is incorrect for determining the optimal `k`.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the profit for each `k` and keep track of the maximum profit.

5. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition should be to compare the profit for the current `k` with the maximum profit found so far.
   - The function should return the maximum profit directly, and the binary search should be used to find the `k` that maximizes this profit.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans`, which is the maximum `k` found during the binary search.
   - However, the problem requires the maximum profit, not the value of `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect condition in the binary search and does not correctly calculate the maximum profit. The function `func_1` should return the profit for a given `k`, and the main loop should keep track of the maximum profit found.

### Correctness:
**False**
