Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input correctly, converting the input string into a list of integers. However, it passes the length of the list `a` to the function `func_1` instead of the list itself. This is a mistake because the function `func_1` is supposed to operate on the list `a`, not just its length.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the length of the list `c` is 2. If it is, it prints a fixed output "4 1" followed by "1 2". This is only correct for the specific case where the input array has exactly two elements and those elements are 0 and 1. It does not handle other cases correctly.
   - If the length of the list `c` is not 2, the function prints a fixed output "13 0". This is incorrect because the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve it depend on the actual values in the array, not just its length.

3. **General Solution**:
   - The program does not attempt to compute the MEX of any subarray or perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array. It simply prints fixed outputs based on the length of the array, which is not a valid solution for the problem.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program does not follow the required output format. It should output the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves. The current implementation only prints the sum and the number of operations, but does not print the operations.

Given these issues, the program is not a correct solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
