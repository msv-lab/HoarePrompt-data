Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the removal of characters to make the string beautiful. The program only counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and then removes all occurrences of "map" from the string. However, this approach is flawed for several reasons:

1. **Overcounting**: The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" separately, but it does not consider that removing characters to make the string beautiful might affect the count of both substrings. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", removing the 'm' from "map" might also affect the "pie" substring.

2. **Incorrect Removal**: The program only removes "map" from the string and then counts "pie". This is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful. It should consider the positions of both "map" and "pie" and remove the minimum number of characters to ensure neither substring is present.

3. **Greedy Approach**: The program does not use a greedy approach to find the minimum number of deletions. It should consider the positions of the characters and remove the fewest possible characters to break the substrings "map" and "pie".

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify the positions of the substrings "map" and "pie".
- Use a dynamic programming or greedy approach to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        # Initialize the count of deletions
        deletions = 0
        
        # Use a greedy approach to remove the minimum number of characters
        i = 0
        while i < len(s) - 2:
            if s[i:i+3] == "map":
                deletions += 1
                i += 3
            elif s[i:i+3] == "pie":
                deletions += 1
                i += 3
            else:
                i += 1
        
        print(deletions)

func()
```

This corrected program uses a greedy approach to iterate through the string and remove the minimum number of characters to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" is a substring. It correctly handles the problem by incrementing the index by 3 whenever a "map" or "pie" substring is found, and counting the deletions accordingly.
