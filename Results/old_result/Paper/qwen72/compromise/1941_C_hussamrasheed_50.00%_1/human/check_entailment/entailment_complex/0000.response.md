Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters to delete from a string to make it beautiful, where a beautiful string does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". However, the program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Substrings**: The program counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and then removes "map" from the string. This approach is flawed because:
   - Removing "map" might create new occurrences of "pie" that were not present initially.
   - The program does not account for overlapping occurrences of "map" and "pie".

2. **Incorrect Output Calculation**: The program simply adds the counts of "map" and "pie" and prints the result. This is incorrect because:
   - The number of characters to delete is not necessarily the sum of the counts of "map" and "pie".
   - The program does not consider the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".

3. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for multiple test cases, but the logic for determining the minimum deletions is flawed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
   - Identify all positions of "map" and "pie" in the string.
   - Use a more sophisticated approach to determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
