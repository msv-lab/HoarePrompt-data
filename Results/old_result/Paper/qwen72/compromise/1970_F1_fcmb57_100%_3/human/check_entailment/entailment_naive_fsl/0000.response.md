Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where a player scores in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a red player scores in a red goal, the blue team should get a point, and vice versa. However, the program does not account for this scenario. It only checks if the player is in a goal and increments the score for the corresponding team, without considering whether the goal is the correct one for scoring a point.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:
```
Input:
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
B2 U
B2 U
B2 L
B2 C .Q
B2 L
B2 L
B2 T
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T

Expected Output:
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1

Actual Output:
6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1
```

In this example, the program works correctly. However, consider the following input where a player scores in the wrong goal:
```
Input:
3 5
.. .. R0 .. ..
RG .. .Q .. BG
.. .. B0 .. ..
5
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 L
R0 L
R0 T

Expected Output:
4 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 1

Actual Output:
4 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 0
```

In this case, the red player (R0) scores in a red goal (RG), but the program incorrectly awards a point to the red team instead of the blue team. This is a violation of the problem description, making the program incorrect.
