### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input. This is correct for the given problem description.
   - The first line is skipped, and the program processes each subsequent line as a test case. This is appropriate for the input format.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - For each test case, the program splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. This is correct based on the input format.

3. **Logic for Tent Calculation**:
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b`. This is an attempt to use universals to fill the tents that extroverts require.
   - The program then calculates the number of tents needed using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.

4. **Expression Analysis**:
   - `b += c` means that all universals are considered as potential extroverts.
   - `-b // 3` is an attempt to calculate the number of tents needed for extroverts, but the negative sign is incorrect. The correct expression should be `b // 3`.
   - `a - -b // 3` is intended to calculate the total number of tents needed, but the negative sign in `-b // 3` makes this incorrect.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts. If `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3, it outputs `-1` to indicate that it is impossible to accommodate all participants.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct logic should be:
     - Each introvert needs one tent.
     - Each extrovert needs a tent with two others, so we need `b // 3` tents for extroverts, and `b % 3` remaining extroverts.
     - If `b % 3` is non-zero, we need to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If `c < b % 3`, it is impossible to accommodate all participants.
     - The remaining universals can be distributed in the remaining tents.

6. **Corrected Expression**:
   - The correct expression should be:
     ```python
     if c < b % 3:
         print(-1)
     else:
         print(a + b // 3 + (b % 3 > 0))
     ```

### Correctness:
- The given program has a logical error in the expression used to calculate the number of tents.
- The negative sign in `-b // 3` is incorrect and should be `b // 3`.
- The condition `c < b % 3` is correct for checking if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots for extroverts.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the logical error in the tent calculation expression.
