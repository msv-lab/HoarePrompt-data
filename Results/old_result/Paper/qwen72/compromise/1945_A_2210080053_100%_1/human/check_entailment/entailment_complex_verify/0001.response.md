### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - For each test case, it splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, s.split())`.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b` with the line `b += c`.
   - This adjustment is made because universals can be used to fill the tents that extroverts require.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - The program then calculates the number of tents needed using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - Let's break down this expression:
     - `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
     - `-b // 3` is used to ensure that the division is performed with floor division, and the negative sign is used to handle the floor division correctly for negative numbers. However, since `b` is always non-negative, this is unnecessary and can be simplified to `b // 3`.
     - `a - -b // 3` calculates the total number of tents needed by subtracting the number of full tents from the number of introverts. This should be `a + b // 3` to correctly account for the total number of tents.
     - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is a conditional expression that checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts. If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Expression:
- **Correctness of `b // 3`:**
  - This correctly calculates the number of full tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
- **Correctness of `a - -b // 3`:**
  - This expression is incorrect. It should be `a + b // 3` to correctly account for the total number of tents needed. The current expression `a - -b // 3` simplifies to `a + b // 3`, but it is written in a confusing and incorrect way.
- **Correctness of the Conditional Expression:**
  - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is correct in its logic. It ensures that if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts, the program outputs `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `0` because no participants mean no tents are needed.
- **When `a > 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `a` because each introvert needs their own tent.
- **When `a = 0`, `b > 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` because there are no universals to fill the tents required by extroverts.
- **When `a = 0`, `b > 0`, and `c > 0`:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of tents needed and checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for handling the number of tents and the conditional check for universals is correct. However, the expression `a - -b // 3` is written in a confusing and incorrect way. It should be simplified to `a + b // 3` to correctly calculate the total number of tents needed.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
