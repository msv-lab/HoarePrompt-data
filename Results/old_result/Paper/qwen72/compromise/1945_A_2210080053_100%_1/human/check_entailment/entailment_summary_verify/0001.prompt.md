You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        b += c
        print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads lines from standard input (excluding the first line), where each line contains three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each line, it calculates a value based on the formula `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` and prints this value. The function does not modify the input variables `a`, `b`, and `c` and does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line as a test case.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - For each test case, it splits the line into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, s.split())`.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b` with the line `b += c`.
   - This adjustment is made because universals can be used to fill the tents that extroverts require.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - The program then calculates the number of tents needed using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - Let's break down this expression:
     - `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
     - `-b // 3` ensures that the division is performed with floor division, and the negative sign is used to handle the floor division correctly for negative numbers.
     - `a - -b // 3` calculates the total number of tents needed by subtracting the number of full tents from the number of introverts.
     - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is a conditional expression that checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts. If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts, and the program outputs `-1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Expression:
- **Correctness of `b // 3`:**
  - This correctly calculates the number of full tents that can be filled with extroverts and universals.
- **Correctness of `a - -b // 3`:**
  - This correctly calculates the total number of tents needed, considering that introverts always need their own tent.
- **Correctness of the Conditional Expression:**
  - The expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` ensures that if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts, the program outputs `-1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **When `a = 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `0` because no participants mean no tents are needed.
- **When `a > 0`, `b = 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `a` because each introvert needs their own tent.
- **When `a = 0`, `b > 0`, and `c = 0`:**
  - The program correctly outputs `-1` because there are no universals to fill the tents required by extroverts.
- **When `a = 0`, `b > 0`, and `c > 0`:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of tents needed and checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given constraints and edge cases. It calculates the minimum number of tents needed or outputs `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

### Correctness:
**True**
