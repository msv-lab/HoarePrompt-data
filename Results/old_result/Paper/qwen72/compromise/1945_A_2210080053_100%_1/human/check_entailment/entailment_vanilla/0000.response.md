### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads input from `open(0)`, which is a way to read from standard input in Python. It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line.
   - Each line is split into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Tent Calculation:**
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b`. This is because universals can be used to fill the tents that extroverts require.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents needed. Let's break it down:
     - `-b // 3` is equivalent to `-(-b // 3)`, which is the same as `b // 3` but with a ceiling effect. This is because `b // 3` gives the integer division of `b` by 3, and `-(-b // 3)` ensures that if `b` is not a multiple of 3, it rounds up to the next integer.
     - `a - -b // 3` is then used to calculate the total number of tents. This is because:
       - `a` introverts each need their own tent.
       - `b // 3` extroverts can be accommodated in `b // 3` tents, each with 3 people.
       - The remaining `b % 3` extroverts need to be accommodated, and this is where the universals `c` come in. If `c` is less than `b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the remaining extroverts, and the program should output `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `c` is less than `b % 3`, the program outputs `-1` because it is impossible to accommodate the remaining extroverts.
   - If `c` is greater than or equal to `b % 3`, the program calculates the total number of tents as `a + b // 3`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis of the Expression `a - -b // 3`:
- The expression `a - -b // 3` is a bit unconventional but mathematically correct. It effectively calculates `a + (b + 2) // 3` because:
  - `-b // 3` is equivalent to `-(b // 3)`, which is the same as `-(b // 3)`.
  - `-(b // 3)` is the same as `-(-b // 3)`, which is `b // 3` but with a ceiling effect.
  - `a - -b // 3` is then `a + (b + 2) // 3`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
- It correctly calculates the number of tents needed for introverts and extroverts.
- It correctly checks if there are enough universals to accommodate the remaining extroverts.
- The expression `a - -b // 3` is mathematically correct and ensures the ceiling effect for the division.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description.

**Correctness: True**
