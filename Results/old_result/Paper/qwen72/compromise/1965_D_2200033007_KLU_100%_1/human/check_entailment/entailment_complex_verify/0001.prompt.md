You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers representing a palindrome array and returns a sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from each index to the end of the array. The original list `a` remains unchanged.

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `odds` remains a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums. The variable `prev` is equal to the last element of `odds`. The variable `idx` is `0` or `-1` depending on whether `n` is even or odd, respectively. The list `a` is populated such that for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` was equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value of `x` from the list `odds`.

    #The program returns the list `a` which is populated based on the conditions described. Each element in `a` is either set to a value from the `odds` list or calculated as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current value from `odds` and `prev` is the previous value from `odds`. The exact values in `a` depend on the values in `odds` and the parity of `n`. If `n` is even, `idx` is `0`, and if `n` is odd, `idx` is `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` takes two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing the sums of subarrays at odd indices, and `n`, an integer representing the length of the original array `a` (where `n` is odd and 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000). It returns a list `a` of length `n`, where each element is either directly set to a value from `odds` or calculated as `(x - prev) // 2`, where `x` is the current value from `odds` and `prev` is the previous value from `odds`. The elements of `a` are populated such that for each `x` in `odds`, if the index `idx` is equal to `n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The final state of the program is that `odds` remains unchanged, `prev` is equal to the last element of `odds`, and `idx` is `-1`.

    #State: `bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal, or one of the lists is empty. Every element in `smallList` is still in `bigList`, but the last elements that were equal have been removed.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` takes two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, which are non-empty lists of integers, with every element in `smallList` also present in `bigList`. It modifies both lists by removing the last elements that are equal until either the last elements are no longer equal or one of the lists becomes empty. The function returns the last element of `bigList`, which is an integer and is not equal to the last element of `smallList` (if `smallList` is not empty). If `smallList` becomes empty, the function returns the last element of `bigList`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to reconstruct a palindromic array `a` from the sums of all but one of its subarrays.
   - The array `a` is a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n + 1 - i]` for all `1 <= i <= n`.
   - We are given `n` and a list of subarray sums, and we need to find the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the array `a`.

2. **Function Analysis:**

   - **func_1(a):**
     - This function generates all subarray sums of the array `a` and returns them sorted.
     - It iterates through all possible subarrays, calculates their sums, and appends them to the list `cts`.
     - The list `cts` is then sorted.
     - This function is correct for generating and sorting subarray sums.

   - **func_2(cts):**
     - This function identifies the unique subarray sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - It uses a stack-like approach to remove pairs of identical sums, leaving only the sums that appear an odd number of times.
     - This function correctly identifies the unique subarray sums that are needed to reconstruct the array `a`.

   - **func_3(odds, n):**
     - This function reconstructs the palindromic array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
     - It initializes an array `a` of length `n` with zeros.
     - It iterates through the unique subarray sums (`odds`) and places the values in the middle of the array, ensuring the array remains palindromic.
     - This function correctly reconstructs the array `a` based on the unique subarray sums.

   - **func_4(bigList, smallList):**
     - This function finds the missing subarray sum by comparing the sorted list of all subarray sums (`bigList`) with the list of given subarray sums (`smallList`).
     - It removes common elements from both lists and returns the last element of `bigList`, which is the missing subarray sum.
     - This function correctly identifies the missing subarray sum.

3. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The functions work together to generate all subarray sums, identify the unique subarray sums, reconstruct the palindromic array, and find the missing subarray sum.
   - Each function performs its intended task correctly, and the overall logic aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
