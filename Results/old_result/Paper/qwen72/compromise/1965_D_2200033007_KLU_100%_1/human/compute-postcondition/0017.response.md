Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the odd-indexed subarray sums and must have at least two elements. `x` is the second element of `odds`, `prev` is now equal to the second element of `odds`, `idx` is `idx - 1`. If `idx == n - 1 - idx`, then `a[idx]` is now equal to the second element of `odds`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` is set to `(x - prev) // 2` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is also set to `(x - prev) // 2`.** 

Explanation:
- The value of `prev` is updated to be equal to the current value of `x`, which is the second element of `odds`.
- The values of `odds`, `x`, `idx`, and the conditions for updating `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` remain unchanged from the initial state.
