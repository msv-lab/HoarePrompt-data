To ensure the loop executes at least once, we need to focus on the conditions specified in the `while` loop head: `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.

1. **Condition 1: `len(smallList) > 0`**
   - This condition checks if `smallList` is not empty. Given that both lists are non-empty, this condition is already satisfied.

2. **Condition 2: `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`**
   - This condition checks if the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`. Since every element in `smallList` is also in `bigList`, it is possible that the last elements are the same, but it is not guaranteed. To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that the last elements of both lists are indeed the same.

Given these considerations, we need to adjust the state to ensure that the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are the same.

State: **`bigList` and `smallList` are lists of integers where every element in `smallList` is also in `bigList`, and both lists are non-empty, and `bigList[-1]` must be equal to `smallList[-1]`**
