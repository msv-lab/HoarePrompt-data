Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` is 0 or not, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`) is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2`, and `ans` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` is 0 or not, and if the last element of `a` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`) is 0, `ans` is 2. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, `k` remains greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is 1; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`, and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions described. Otherwise, `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the conditions described. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions described. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2 as it was initially. In both cases, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` or `a[n-2]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` is updated to 1 or 2. If `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1. In this case, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
