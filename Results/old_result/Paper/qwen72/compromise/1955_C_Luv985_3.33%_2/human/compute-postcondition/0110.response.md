The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since `r` was initially `n - 1` or `n - 2`, after the decrement, `r` will be `n - 2` or `n - 3` respectively.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the conditions described, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n-1]` or `a[n-2]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`.**
