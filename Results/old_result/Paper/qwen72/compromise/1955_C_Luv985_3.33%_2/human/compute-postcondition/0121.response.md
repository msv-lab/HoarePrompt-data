Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `2 * mi` from its current value.
- The values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` are already `a[l] - mi` and `a[r] - mi` respectively, as per the initial state.
- All other variables (`a`, `T`, `t`, `n`, `l`, `r`, `mi`) remain unchanged or retain their initial conditions.
