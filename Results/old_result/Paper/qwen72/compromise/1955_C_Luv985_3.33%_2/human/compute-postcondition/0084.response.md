Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`.**

In natural language: The list `a` remains a list of integers. The value of `T` is still the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0. The value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4. The value of `n` is still greater than 1. The value of `k` is still greater than 0. The value of `l` is still 0. The value of `r` is still `n - 1`. The value of `ans` is still 0. The value of `mi` is still the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. The value of `a[0]` is now `a[0] - mi`. The value of `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`.
