Postcondition: **`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[n-1]` (after adjustment) was 0, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `l` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` if `a[r]` was not 0, or `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0, and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[r]` was not 0, or 2, 3, or 4 if `a[r]` was 0, depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r` plus the increment by 1 if `a[l]` was 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2.**
