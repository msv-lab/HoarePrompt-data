Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `l` is updated to 1 or 2. If `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is incremented by 1 and `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, and if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, `ans` is incremented by 1. In this case, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
