Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `a[l]` is 0, `ans` is `ans + 1` and `l` is 1 or 2, `ans` is `ans + 1`.**

Explanation: The value of `r` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `r` was `n - 1` or `n - 2`, so after the decrement, `r` is now `n - 2` or `n - 3`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
