Postcondition: ***`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is 0 or 1 depending on whether `a[0]` (after adjustment) was 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on whether `a[n-1]` (after adjustment) was 0, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 depending on the adjustments made to `l` and `r`, and `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is reduced by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` is updated to `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n-1]` is updated to `a[n-1] - mi` (or `a[n-2] - mi` if `a[n-1]` was 0). If `a[l]` (which is `a[0]` after adjustment) is 0, then `l` is updated to 1, `ans` is updated to 1, and the current value of `a[l]` is the value of `a[1]` minus `mi`. If `a[r]` (which is `a[n-1]` after adjustment) is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is updated to 2, and the current value of `a[r]` is unknown. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is updated to `k % 2`, `ans` is updated to 1 if `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
