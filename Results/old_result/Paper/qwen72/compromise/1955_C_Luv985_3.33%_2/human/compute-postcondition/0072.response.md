The code snippet `n, k = input().split()` reads a line of input and splits it into two values, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`. The input is expected to be two space-separated values, typically strings. The variables `n` and `k` are now strings, and the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is the input integer minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string, `k` is a string, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right. If `l` is equal to `r`, then `ans` is the number of elements in the list `a` that have been reduced to 0, plus 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`; otherwise, `ans` remains the same.**
