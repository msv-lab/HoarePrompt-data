Output State: **`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are now strings representing integers such that 1 ≤ int(n) ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ int(k) ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
