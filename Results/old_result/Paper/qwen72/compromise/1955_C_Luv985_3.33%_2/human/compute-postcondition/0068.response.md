Postcondition: ***`T` is the input integer minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is 0 or a positive integer that is less than the smallest value in the list `a` after all adjustments, `a` is a list of integers where each integer was originally represented as a string in the list `a`, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right. If `l` is equal to `r`, then `ans` is the number of elements in the list `a` that have been reduced to 0, plus 1 if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l]`; otherwise, `ans` remains the same.***
