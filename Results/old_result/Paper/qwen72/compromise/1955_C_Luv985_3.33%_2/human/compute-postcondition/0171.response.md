Output State: **`a` is a list of integers, `T` is the input integer minus 3 and must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is the first input integer and must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`**

Explanation:
- The value of `a[0]` is decremented by `mi`, where `mi` is the minimum of `a[0]` and `a[n-1]`.
- All other variables (`T`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `l`, `r`, `ans`, and `a[n-1]`) remain unchanged.
- The updated value of `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`.
