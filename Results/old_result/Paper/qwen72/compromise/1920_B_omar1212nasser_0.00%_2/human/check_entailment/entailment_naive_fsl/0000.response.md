Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_2` contains a hard-coded return statement for a specific case (`if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0`), which is not a general solution and will fail for other inputs that should logically return a different result.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
6 6 3
1 2 3 4 5 6
```
According to the problem description, Alice can remove all elements, and the sum of the array after the game would be 0. However, the program will not return 0 for this input because it will not reach the hard-coded condition and will instead proceed with the incorrect logic.

Additionally, the logic for handling the removal and negation of elements is flawed. The program does not correctly consider the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. For instance, Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob should negate the largest elements to minimize the sum. The current logic does not always achieve this optimal strategy.
