Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `i` is `x-1`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `x`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

The code assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Therefore, `ans2` now holds the same value as `ans1`, which is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
