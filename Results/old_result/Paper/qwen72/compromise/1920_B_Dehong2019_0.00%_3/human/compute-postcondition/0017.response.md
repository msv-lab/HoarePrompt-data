Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` is 0, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`, `k` is greater than 0, and the sum of `i` and `x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its previous value.
- The previous value of `ans1` was the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
