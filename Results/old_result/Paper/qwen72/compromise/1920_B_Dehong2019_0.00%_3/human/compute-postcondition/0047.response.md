Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, `ans1` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0]` minus `2 * a[x]`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, and the sum of `i` and `x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value.
- The value of `a[i + x]` is the element at the index `x` in the list `a`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans1` is the original `ans1` minus `2 * a[x]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
