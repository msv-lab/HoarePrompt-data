Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than `x`, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x`, `ans1` is now `ans1 + a[x] - 2 * a[x + x]`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans` is the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its current value.
- The current value of `ans1` was `ans1 + a[x]`.
- Therefore, the new value of `ans1` is `ans1 + a[x] - 2 * a[x + x]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` is still the maximum value between the updated `ans1` and `ans2`.
