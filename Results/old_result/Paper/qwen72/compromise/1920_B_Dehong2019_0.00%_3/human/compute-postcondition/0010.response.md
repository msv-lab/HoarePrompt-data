The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `x` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]`, `i` is 2, `x` must be greater than 2**
