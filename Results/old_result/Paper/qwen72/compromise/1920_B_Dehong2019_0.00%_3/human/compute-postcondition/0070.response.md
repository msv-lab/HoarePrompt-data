Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 1, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]`, and `ans` is the maximum value of `ans1` and `ans2` after all iterations.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[1]` from its current value.
- The current value of `ans1` before the update is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]`.
- After the update, `ans1` becomes the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]` minus `2 * a[1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
