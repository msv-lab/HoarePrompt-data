Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 1, `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 2, `ans1` is increased by `a[2]`, `ans` is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is incremented by the value at index 2 of the list `a`, which is a list of input integers sorted in descending order.
- The value of `ans` is still the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, but `ans1` has been updated.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2`) remain unchanged.
