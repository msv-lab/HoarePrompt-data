Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `n`, `k`, and `x` are input integers, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is 0, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[k-1]`, `ans1` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]`.**

Explanation:
- `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i]` from its current value. Since `i` is 0, `ans1` is now the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * a[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
