Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, and `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.** 

The code snippet assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`, making `ans2` equal to `ans1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
