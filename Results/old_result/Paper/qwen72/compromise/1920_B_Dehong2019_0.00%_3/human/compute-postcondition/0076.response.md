Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers sorted in descending order, `i` is `x-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]`, and `ans2` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by adding `a[i]` to its current value.
- Since `i` is `x-1`, `a[i]` is `a[x-1]`.
- Therefore, `ans1` becomes the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]`.
- The value of `ans2` remains unchanged and is still equal to the sum of all elements in `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`) remain the same as in the initial state.
