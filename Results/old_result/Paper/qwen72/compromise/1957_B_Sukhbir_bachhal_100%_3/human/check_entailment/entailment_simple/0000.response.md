### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Sequence Construction:**
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k` as the only element in the sequence. This is correct because the sum of one element must be `k`, and the binary representation of `k` will have the maximum number of 1s.
   - If `n` is greater than 1, the program constructs the sequence as follows:
     - It calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest bit position `counter` that is set in the binary representation of `k`.
     - It appends `2 ** counter - 1` to the sequence. This value is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position of `k`. This ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s.
     - It appends `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to the sequence. This ensures that the sum of the sequence is `k`.
     - It appends `0` for the remaining `n - 2` elements to ensure the sequence has `n` elements.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the highest bit position that is set in the binary representation of `n`.
   - It correctly handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning -1, but this case is not relevant for the problem since `k` is always at least 1.
   - For positive `n`, it shifts `n` right until `n` becomes 0, counting the number of shifts. The number of shifts minus one gives the highest bit position set in `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - For `n > 1`, it ensures the sum of the sequence is `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the sequence for each test case, which meets the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided. It correctly constructs the sequence for both `n = 1` and `n > 1` cases, ensuring the sum is `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
