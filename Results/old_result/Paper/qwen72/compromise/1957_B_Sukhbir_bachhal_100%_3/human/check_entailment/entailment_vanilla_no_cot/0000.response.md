Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the constraints. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case**: If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k`, which is correct because the only way to satisfy the conditions is to have a single element equal to `k`.

3. **Multiple Elements Case**:
   - The program uses a function `func_1` to find the highest bit position in the binary representation of `k`.
   - It then constructs the sequence by:
     - Adding `2 ** counter - 1` to the array, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit position found.
     - Adding `k - arr[-1]` to the array, which ensures the sum of the sequence is `k`.
     - Filling the remaining `n-2` elements with 0s, which does not affect the sum or the bitwise OR result.

4. **Bitwise OR Maximization**:
   - The number `2 ** counter - 1` is chosen to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - The remaining value `k - arr[-1]` is added to ensure the sum is `k`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the sequence for each test case, which meets the problem's requirements.

The logic and implementation are sound and should work correctly for the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
