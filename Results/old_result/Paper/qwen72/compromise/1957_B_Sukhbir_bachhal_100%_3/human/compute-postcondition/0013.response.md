Output State: **`n` is 0; `position` is the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. Each iteration of the loop performs a right shift operation on `n` (`n >>= 1`), which effectively divides `n` by 2 and discards the remainder. This operation continues until `n` becomes 0.
- The variable `position` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. The number of times the loop will execute is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial value of `n`. For example, if `n` is 8 (which is `1000` in binary), the loop will execute 4 times (since 8 has 4 bits in its binary representation).
- After the loop finishes, `n` will be 0, and `position` will be the number of bits in the binary representation of the initial `n`.
