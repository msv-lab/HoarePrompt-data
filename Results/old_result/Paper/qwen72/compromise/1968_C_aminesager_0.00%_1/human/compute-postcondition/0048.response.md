Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `line` is a new string input by the user.
   - `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`.
   - `a` is a list constructed as follows:
     - The last element of `a` is 1000.
     - The second-to-last element of `a` is `1000 - T[0]`.
     - The third-to-last element of `a` is `1000 - T[0] - T[1]`.
     - This pattern continues until the first element of `a` is `1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`.

3. **Constructing the List `a`:**
   - The list `a` is constructed by starting with 1000 and subtracting the cumulative sum of elements from `T` in reverse order.
   - For example, if `T = [100, 200, 300]` and `n = 3`, then:
     - `a[0] = 1000 - 100 - 200 = 700`
     - `a[1] = 1000 - 100 = 900`
     - `a[2] = 1000`

4. **Constructing the String `result`:**
   - Each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.
   - For the example above, `result` would be `"700 900 1000"`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `result`.

Given the initial state and the construction of the list `a`, the output will be a space-separated string of the elements of `a`.

Output: **"1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2] 1000 - T[0] - T[1] ... 1000 - T[0] 1000" (where each element is the result of the corresponding subtraction from 1000)**

For a concrete example, if `T = [100, 200, 300]` and `n = 3`, the output would be:

Output: **"700 900 1000"**
