Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 999 - T[0], (999 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., 1000 - (T[0] + T[1] + ... + T[n-2])], `i` is `n-1`.**

### Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is used to control the loop but is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `line` remains unchanged as it is only used to derive the list `T` and is not modified within the loop.
- The list `T` remains unchanged as it is derived from `line` and is not modified within the loop.
- The list `a` starts with the element 1000 and grows with each iteration of the loop. Each new element in `a` is calculated by subtracting the corresponding element in `T` from the previous element in `a`.
- The variable `i` ends up being `n-1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the list `a` will contain `n` elements, where each element is derived by successively subtracting the elements of `T` from the initial value of 1000.
