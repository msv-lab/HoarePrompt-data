The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user through the `input()` function. All other variables (`t`, `line`, `T`, `a`, `i`, `result`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 3, `n` is an input integer, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is [1000 - sum(T[:n-1]), ..., (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], 1000 - T[0], 1000], `i` is `n-1`, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.**
