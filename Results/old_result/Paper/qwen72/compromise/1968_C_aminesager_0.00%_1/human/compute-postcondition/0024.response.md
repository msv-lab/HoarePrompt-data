Output State: **`t` is a non-zero integer between -1 and 10^4 - 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `line` is a new string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 1000 - T[0]], `i` is 1, `result` is a string where each element of the list `a` is converted to a string and joined with spaces.** 

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is 1, `a[i - 1]` is `a[0]`, which is 1000.
- `T[i - 1]` is `T[0]`, which is the first element of the list `T` derived from the user input `line`.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `1000 - T[0]`.
- The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `i`, and `result`) remain unchanged.
