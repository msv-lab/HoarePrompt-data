The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `line` is a string input by the user, `T` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `line`, `a` is a list containing the elements [1000, 999 - T[0], (999 - T[0]) - T[1]], `i` is 3**
