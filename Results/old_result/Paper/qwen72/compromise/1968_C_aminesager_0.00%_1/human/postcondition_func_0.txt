The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n` and a list of `n-1` integers. It then computes a sequence of integers based on these inputs and prints the resulting sequence as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with `t` set to 0. The final state of the program includes the processed results being printed to the standard output, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `line`, `T`, `a`, and `i` holding their respective final values from the last test case.
