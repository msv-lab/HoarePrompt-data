Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as specified. The logic used to construct the array `a` from the array `x` is flawed. Specifically, the line `a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])` does not ensure that `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}` for all `2 ≤ i ≤ n`. Instead, it subtracts the value of `T[i - 1]` from the previous element in `a`, which does not satisfy the modulo condition required by the problem.

A correct approach would involve constructing the array `a` such that each `a_i` is chosen to satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`. One way to do this is to set `a_1` to a sufficiently large value and then compute subsequent values of `a` based on the modulo condition.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [10**9]  # Start with a large value for a_1
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a.append(a[-1] + x[i])  # Ensure a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that each `a_i` is constructed such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`, which satisfies the problem's requirements.
