Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is done using a while loop that decrements `t` until it reaches zero. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Array Initialization**: The function initializes an array `a` with a starting value of 1000. This is a reasonable choice because it ensures that `a[0]` is greater than any possible value of `x_i` (since `1 <= x_i <= 500`). This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Array Construction**: The function constructs the array `a` by iterating through the input values `T` and appending `a[i-1] - T[i-1]` to the array `a`. This approach is incorrect because it does not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i % a_{i-1}`. Instead, it should be constructing `a` such that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i`. The correct approach is to set `a_i = a_{i-1} + x_i` for each `i` from 2 to `n`. This ensures that `a_i % a_{i-1} = x_i` because `a_i` will always be greater than `a_{i-1}` and the remainder when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}` will be `x_i`.

4. **Reversing the Array**: After constructing the array `a`, the function reverses it. This is unnecessary and does not contribute to the correctness of the solution. The reversal is not needed because the array `a` should be constructed in the correct order from the beginning.

5. **Output**: The function prints the constructed array `a` as a space-separated string. This part of the program is correct.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input().strip()
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        # Initialize the first element of a
        a = [1000]
        
        # Construct the array a
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a.append(a[-1] + T[i])
        
        # Print the result
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: We start with `a[0] = 1000`.
- **Construction**: For each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, we set `a[i] = a[i-1] + T[i-1]`. This ensures that `a[i] % a[i-1] = T[i-1]`.
- **Output**: We print the constructed array `a` as a space-separated string.

### Final Correctness:
The original program does not correctly construct the array `a` to satisfy the given conditions. The corrected program, as shown above, would be correct.

Final: **False**
