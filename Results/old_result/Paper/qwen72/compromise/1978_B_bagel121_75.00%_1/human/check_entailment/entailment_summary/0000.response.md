### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` as specified in the problem description.

2. **Case Analysis**:
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the function prints `n * a`. This is correct because if the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the modified price `b`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price to maximize profit.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the function calculates `k` as the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`. This is correct because `k` should be the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without the price dropping below `a`.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `ans` as the integer value of `(b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`. The sum of the first `k` terms of this series is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `k * (first_term + last_term) / 2`.
   - The function then calculates `p2` as `(n - k) * a`, which is the profit from selling the remaining buns at the usual price.
   - Finally, it prints the sum of `ans` and `p2`, which is the total profit.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) and `a` and `b` are also large.
   - It correctly handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning all buns are sold at the usual price.

5. **Arithmetic and Integer Division**:
   - The use of integer division in the calculation of `ans` is appropriate because the profit must be an integer.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all edge cases. The logic and calculations are sound and produce the correct results for the given test cases.

### Correctness:
