The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. These parameters are integers where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function is expected to return a result for each test case, but the specific output based on these parameters is not provided in the question.

Given the constraints and the typical structure of such functions, we can infer that the function might be designed to process these parameters and return a result for each test case, but without more information about the output, we can only describe the parameters it is expected to handle.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on these parameters is not provided.**
