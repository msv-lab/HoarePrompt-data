Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of days required to rearrange the cats from the initial state to the desired state. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s1`, and the desired state of the boxes `s2`.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (number of boxes), `s1` (initial state), and `s2` (desired state).

3. **Counting Operations**:
   - `cats_to_add` counts the number of boxes that need a cat (i.e., where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1').
   - `cats_to_remove` counts the number of boxes that need to have a cat removed (i.e., where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0').

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the maximum of `cats_to_add` and `cats_to_remove`. This is because the scientists can perform at most one operation per day, and the number of days required is determined by the larger of the two counts (since you can't add more cats than you need to or remove more cats than you have).

5. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1`.

The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
