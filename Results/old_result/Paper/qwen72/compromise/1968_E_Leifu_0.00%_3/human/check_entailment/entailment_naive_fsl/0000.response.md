Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, specifically for values of `n` greater than 3. For `n = 4`, the program outputs the following points:
```
1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
```
However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, the points (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and (4, 4) result in the following Manhattan distances:
- |1-1| + |1-2| = 1
- |1-1| + |1-4| = 3
- |1-2| + |1-4| = 4
- |1-4| + |1-4| = 6

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is {1, 3, 4, 6}, which has 4 distinct distances. However, it is possible to achieve more distinct distances with a different arrangement. For example, the points (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 4) result in the following distances:
- |1-1| + |1-3| = 2
- |1-1| + |1-4| = 3
- |1-4| + |1-3| = 5
- |1-4| + |1-4| = 6
- |1-3| + |3-4| = 3
- |1-3| + |3-3| = 2
- |4-4| + |3-4| = 1
- |4-4| + |3-3| = 0

The set \(\mathcal{H}\) is {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6}, which has 6 distinct distances, which is greater than 4. Therefore, the program does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
