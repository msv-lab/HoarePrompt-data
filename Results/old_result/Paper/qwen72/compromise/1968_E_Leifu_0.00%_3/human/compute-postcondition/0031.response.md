The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be 2.
- `t` must still be an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, but for the loop to continue, `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 2, `t` must be greater than 2**
