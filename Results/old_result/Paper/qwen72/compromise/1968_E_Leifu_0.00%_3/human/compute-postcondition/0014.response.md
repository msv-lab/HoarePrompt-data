Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 6.
- `j` is 6.

The print statement is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The value of `j` is explicitly given as 6.
2. The print statement converts `j` to a string using `str(j)`, which results in the string `"6"`.
3. The print statement concatenates two instances of the string `"6"` with a space in between, resulting in the string `"6 6"`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement is:
Output: **6 6**
