Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the range 1 to 50, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `i` remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute at least once. The loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches `n`.
- After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to `n`. This is because the loop increments `j` by 1 each time, starting from 4, and stops when `j` is no longer less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the final value of `j` will be `n`.
