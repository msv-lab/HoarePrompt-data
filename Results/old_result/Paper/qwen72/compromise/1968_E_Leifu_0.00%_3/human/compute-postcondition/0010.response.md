Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 0.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
- `j` is 4.

The print statement is:
```
print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))
```

Let's break it down step by step:

1. The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 4.
2. The `print` statement converts `j` to a string and concatenates it with a space and another string representation of `j`.
3. Therefore, the `print` statement will concatenate `str(4)` with a space and `str(4)`.

So, the output will be:
Output: **4 4**
