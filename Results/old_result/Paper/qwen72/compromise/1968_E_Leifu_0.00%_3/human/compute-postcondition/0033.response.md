Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `n` is an input integer.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('1 1')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects mentioned in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'1 1'`.

Output: **1 1**
