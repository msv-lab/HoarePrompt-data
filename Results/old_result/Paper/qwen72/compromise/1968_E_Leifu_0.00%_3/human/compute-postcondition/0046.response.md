The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function might internally use or expect values for `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer for each test case such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function returns a result based on these values, but the specific output is not described in the provided information. 

Since the output is not specified, we can only infer that the function processes `t` and `n` in some way and returns a result that is dependent on these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 50, and `n` is between 2 and 10^3 for each test case. It returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
