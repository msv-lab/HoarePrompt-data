Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 50.
- `i` is 2.
- `t` must be greater than 2.
- `n` is an input integer.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1 2')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'1 2'`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `n` are not used in the `print` statement.
- The condition that `t` must be greater than 2 does not affect the output of the `print` statement.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'1 2'`.
Output: **1 2**
