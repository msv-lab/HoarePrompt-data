The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`. It then processes `t` test cases, each involving an integer `n` such that `2 <= n <= 10^3`. For each test case, the function prints the pairs `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and either `(2, 3)` if `n == 3` or `(2, 4)` followed by pairs `(j, j)` for `j` ranging from 4 to `n` if `n >= 4`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the final state of the program is that `t` test cases have been processed and the corresponding pairs have been printed.
