Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is `n - 3`, `dp[i][j]` is now equal to `dp[i + 1][j]`.**

Explanation:
- The code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i + 1][j]`.
- `i` is -1, so `dp[i][j]` is `dp[-1][j]`.
- `j` is `n - 3`, so `dp[i][j]` is `dp[-1][n - 3]`.
- The value of `dp[-1][n - 3]` is now the same as `dp[0][n - 3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
