The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` and `n`. The loop iterates `i` from `n - 3` down to `0` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1, and `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be set to `n - 3` and `n` must still be at least 3.

However, since the loop has already executed and `i` is -1, the next value for `i` should be `n - 4` for the loop to continue. But the loop will only continue if `n - 4` is greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be at least 4.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is -1**
