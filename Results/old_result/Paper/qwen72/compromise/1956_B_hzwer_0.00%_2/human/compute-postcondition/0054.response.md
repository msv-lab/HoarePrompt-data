To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from `n - 1` down to `0` (inclusive) in reverse order. For the loop to execute at least once, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`, which means `n` must be at least `1`.

However, the problem statement specifies that `n` must be at least `4`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `4` for the loop to execute as intended. Additionally, `j` should start at `n - 1` and decrement to `0`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `cases` is a list of tuples
- `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4
- `cards` is a list of integers read from the input
- `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop
- `i` is n - 4
- `j` is -1

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to set `j` to `n - 1` and ensure `n` is at least 4.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is n - 4, `j` is n - 1**
