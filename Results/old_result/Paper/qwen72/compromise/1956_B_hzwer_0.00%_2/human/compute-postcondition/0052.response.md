Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is -1, `j` is -1. The `dp` table has been fully populated according to the rules of the loop, where for each `j` from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive), if `j + 1` does not appear in `cards`, `dp[-1][j]` is set to `dp[0][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[-1][j]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[0][j]` and `dp[1][j-1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once in `cards`, `dp[-1][j]` is updated to the maximum value among `dp[0][j]`, `dp[1][j-1] + 1`, and `dp[0][j+1]`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `j` will be `-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its backward traversal from `n-1` to `0`. The `dp` table will have been updated such that for each index `j` from `n-1` down to `0`, the value of `dp[-1][j]` will reflect the maximum value based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, if the number `j + 1` is not in the `cards` list, `dp[-1][j]` will be the same as `dp[0][j]`. If `j + 1` appears exactly once in `cards`, `dp[-1][j]` will be the maximum of `dp[0][j]` and `dp[1][j-1] + 1`. If `j + 1` appears more than once, `dp[-1][j]` will be the maximum of `dp[0][j]`, `dp[1][j-1] + 1`, and `dp[0][j+1]`. The initial state of the other variables (`t`, `cases`, `n`, `cards`) remains unchanged.
