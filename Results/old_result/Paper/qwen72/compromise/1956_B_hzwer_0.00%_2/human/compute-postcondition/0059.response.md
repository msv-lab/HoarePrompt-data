The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by setting it to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n - 4` and `j` is `n - 1`. The value of `dp[i][j]` will be updated based on the values of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1]`.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **`dp[i][j]`**: This element in the 2D list `dp` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`.
2. **`i` and `j`**: These variables remain unchanged at `n - 4` and `n - 1`, respectively.
3. **`dp[i + 1][j]` and `dp[i + 2][j - 1]`**: These elements are used in the calculation but their values are not changed by this code snippet.

The initial state also mentions that the integer `j + 1` appears exactly once in the list `cards`, and this remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is a list of tuples, `n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input, `dp` is a 2D list of size (n + 1) x (n + 1) where each element is initialized to 0, except for the elements that have been updated by the loop, `i` is `n - 4`, `j` is `n - 1`, `dp[n - 4][n - 1]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[n - 3][n - 1]` and `dp[n - 2][n - 2] + 1`, and the integer `j + 1` appears exactly once in the list `cards`.**
