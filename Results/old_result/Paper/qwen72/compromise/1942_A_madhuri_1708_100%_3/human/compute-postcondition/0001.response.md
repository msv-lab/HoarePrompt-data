Output State: **The loop reads each line from the input (excluding the first line), splits the line into two integers n and k, and then prints a list of n integers based on the conditions: if k is greater than or equal to 2, it prints a list of n integers all equal to k if n equals k, otherwise it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 1 to n. The loop continues until all lines are processed.**
