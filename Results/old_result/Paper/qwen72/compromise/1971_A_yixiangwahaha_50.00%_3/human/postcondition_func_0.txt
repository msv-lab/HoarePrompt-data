The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases, and then reads 10 pairs of integers (x, y) for each test case. It stores these integers in two lists, `x` and `y`. After reading the inputs, the function prints the pairs of integers from `x` and `y` for each index `i` from 0 to 9, ensuring that the smaller integer is printed first followed by the larger integer. The function does not return any value, and the lists `x` and `y` are not modified after the printing. The initial input integer `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
