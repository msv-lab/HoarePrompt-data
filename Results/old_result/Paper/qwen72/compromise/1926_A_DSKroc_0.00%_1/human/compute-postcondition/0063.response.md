Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string `s`. If `ac` is greater than `bc`, the program executes the if part. Otherwise, if `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`, the program executes the else part.***
