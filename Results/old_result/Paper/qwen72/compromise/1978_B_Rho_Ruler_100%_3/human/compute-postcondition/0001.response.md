Output State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0.**

The initial state of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, and `high` remains unchanged. The variable `max_profit` is initialized to 0.
