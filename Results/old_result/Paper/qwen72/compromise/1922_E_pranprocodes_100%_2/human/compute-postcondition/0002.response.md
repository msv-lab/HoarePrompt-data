The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a single positive integer `X` where 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18. The function should return an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array should be within the range [-10^9, 10^9].

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `X` (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18) and returns an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, or -1 if no such array exists. The elements of the array are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].**
