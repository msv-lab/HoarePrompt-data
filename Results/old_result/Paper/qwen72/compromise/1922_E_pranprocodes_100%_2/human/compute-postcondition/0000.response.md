The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
