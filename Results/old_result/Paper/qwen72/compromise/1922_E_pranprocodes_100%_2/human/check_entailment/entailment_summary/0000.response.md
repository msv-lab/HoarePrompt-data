Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `X` and initializes `max` and `min` to the boundaries of the allowed range for array elements.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The function uses a loop to construct the array `ans` such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The loop continues until `X` becomes 1.
   - If `X` is even, it appends the current `max` value to `ans`, decrements `max`, and divides `X` by 2.
   - If `X` is odd, it appends the current `min` value to `ans`, increments `min`, and subtracts 1 from `X`.
   - The length of the array `t` is incremented with each iteration.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the function reverses the array `ans` to ensure the correct order of elements.
   - It prints the length of the array `t` and then the array itself.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `X` is 1, which is a valid input. According to the problem description, if `X` is 1, the function should print `-1` and an empty array.
   - The function does not check if the length of the array exceeds 200, which is a requirement of the problem.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly generates an array that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences for valid inputs.
   - However, it fails to handle the edge case where `X` is 1, and it does not ensure that the length of the array does not exceed 200.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all edge cases and constraints specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
