Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, and `k` is not a power of 2, and `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `p` is assigned the value of the length of the string `l`.
- `l` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
- Since `k` is even and not a power of 2, its binary representation will have more than one '1' and an even number of bits.
- The length of `l` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.
