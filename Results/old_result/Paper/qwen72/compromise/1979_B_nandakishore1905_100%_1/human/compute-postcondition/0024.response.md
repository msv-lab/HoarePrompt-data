Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x â‰  y, `i` is 0, `n` and `m` are input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (p - 1), `f` is `k - 3*q` and `f` must not be a power of 2, `l` is updated to the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix.**
