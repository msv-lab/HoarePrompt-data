Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific pattern.

2. **Prime Factorization**:
   - `func_1` computes the prime factorization of a given integer \( n \) and returns a generator that yields all divisors of \( n \).
   - The prime factorization is stored in a dictionary `factors` where each key is a prime factor and the value is the exponent indicating how many times the factor divides \( n \).

3. **Divisor Generation**:
   - `generate` is a recursive function that generates all divisors of \( n \) based on the prime factorization.
   - It works by recursively multiplying each divisor from the next level of recursion by powers of the current prime factor.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates two sets of potential \( k \) values:
     - `ans` is the set of \( k \) values derived from \( n - x \).
     - `ans2` is the set of \( k \) values derived from \( n + x - 2 \).
   - The conditions for a valid \( k \) are:
     - \( k \) must be even.
     - \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).
   - The final answer is the union of the two sets, and the length of this union is printed.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( x = 1 \) by only considering \( n - x \) for potential \( k \) values.
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) are respected, and the program ensures that \( k \) is a natural number greater than 1.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The prime factorization and divisor generation logic in `func_1` and `generate` are correct.
   - The main logic correctly filters and counts the valid \( k \) values based on the given conditions.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
