Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to factorize the number `n` and then generate factors using the `generate` function.
   - However, the `primes` and `factors` variables are not defined within the scope of `func_1`. They are defined inside the function but not passed to `generate` when it is called.
   - The `generate` function is called with `0` as an argument, but `primes` and `factors` are not available in the global scope, which will cause an error.

2. **Function 2 (`generate`)**:
   - The `generate` function is a recursive generator that is supposed to generate all factors of the number `n` based on its prime factorization.
   - However, `primes` and `factors` are not passed as arguments to `generate`, and they are not defined within the function. This will cause a `NameError` when the function is called.

3. **Logical Flow**:
   - The program does not actually solve the problem of determining how many natural numbers `k` fit the given constraints. The problem requires a specific logic to determine the valid `k` values based on the position `n` and the number `x` received during the settling.
   - The provided functions are focused on factorization, which is not directly relevant to the problem at hand.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem, you need to determine the valid `k` values that fit the given constraints. The key is to understand the pattern of the settling and how it repeats every `2k - 2` positions. Here is a correct approach:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The numbers repeat every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given position `n` and number `x`, you need to check if `n` can be expressed in the form of the pattern described.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - For each `k` starting from 2, check if the position `n` can be expressed in the form of the pattern.
   - Specifically, check if `n % (2k - 2)` is within the range of the pattern for the given `x`.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Iterate over possible values of `k` and count how many of them satisfy the conditions.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
def count_valid_ks(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, x in test_cases:
        count = 0
        for k in range(2, n):
            period = 2 * k - 2
            if (n - 1) % period == x - 1 or (n - 1) % period == (2 * k - 1) - x:
                count += 1
        results.append(count)
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 5
test_cases = [(10, 2), (3, 1), (76, 4), (100, 99), (1000000000, 500000000)]
results = count_valid_ks(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This implementation correctly counts the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
