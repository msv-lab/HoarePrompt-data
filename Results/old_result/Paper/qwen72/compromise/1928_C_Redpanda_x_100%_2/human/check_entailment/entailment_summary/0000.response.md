### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. The pattern is: \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n)`**:
     - This function computes the prime factorization of \( n \) and returns a generator that yields the prime factors.
     - It is used to find all divisors of \( n \) by generating all possible products of the prime factors.
   - **`generate(k)`**:
     - This function generates all possible products of the prime factors up to the specified power.
     - It is a recursive function that yields all divisors of \( n \).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is to find all possible values of \( k \) that satisfy the given constraints.
   - The program calculates two sets of possible \( k \) values:
     - One set is derived from \( n - x \).
     - Another set is derived from \( n + x - 2 \) if \( x \neq 1 \).
   - The sets are then combined, and the length of the union set is printed as the answer.

4. **Constraints and Conditions**:
   - The program ensures that \( k \) is even and \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \).
   - This is because \( k \) must be even to fit the pattern, and \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \) ensures that \( x \) is within the valid range of the pattern.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( x = 1 \) by only considering \( n - x \).
   - For \( x \neq 1 \), it considers both \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \).

6. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \) that meet the conditions.
   - The use of sets ensures that each valid \( k \) is counted only once.
   - The conditions \( k \) is even and \( k / 2 + 1 \geq x \) are correctly applied.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
