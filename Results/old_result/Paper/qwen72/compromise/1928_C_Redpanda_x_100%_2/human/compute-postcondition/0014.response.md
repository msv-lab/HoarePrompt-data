Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.**

Explanation:
- The value of `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded.
- All other variables (`k`, `rest`, `prime`, `factor`, `prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]`, `_`) remain unchanged.
- The precondition that `rest` is a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`, and `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, still holds true.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but its specific value is not provided, so we only note that it has been incremented.
