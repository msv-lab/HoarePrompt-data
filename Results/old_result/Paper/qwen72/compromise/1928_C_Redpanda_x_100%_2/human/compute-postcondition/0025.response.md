The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` and `factors[prime]`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` was incremented by 1, and it must be less than `factors[prime] + 1` for the loop to execute again.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `_` must be less than `factors[prime] + 1`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `factors[prime]` remains the same.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime_to_i`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `factors[prime] + 1`. The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**
