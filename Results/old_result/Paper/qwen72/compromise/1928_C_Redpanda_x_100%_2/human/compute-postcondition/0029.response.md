The only objects in the loop head are `factor` and `rest`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `rest` being an iterable with more elements to yield. At the end of the last iteration, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, and `factor` is the next element in `rest`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rest` must still have at least one more element to yield. Since `factor` is the next element in `rest`, after the last iteration, `factor` has already been consumed. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `factor` will be the next element in `rest`.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`**
