Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and the value `factor * prime` is yielded.**

Explanation:
- `prime_to_i` is updated to `prime * prime` because the code multiplies `prime_to_i` by `prime`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
