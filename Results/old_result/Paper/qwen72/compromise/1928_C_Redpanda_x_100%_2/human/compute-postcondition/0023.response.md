Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 0, `_` is incremented by 1, and `_` must be less than `factors[prime] + 1`. The value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`.
- The value of `factor * prime_to_i` is calculated using the current values of `factor` and `prime_to_i`.
- The variable `_` is incremented by 1, but it must still be less than `factors[prime] + 1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
