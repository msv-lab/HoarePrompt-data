The only objects in the loop head are `factor` and `rest`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `rest` iterable. If `rest` has more elements, the loop will continue to execute. At the end of the last iteration, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, and `factor` is the first element in `rest`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `rest` must still be a non-empty iterable, and `factor` must be the next element in `rest`.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element in `rest`**
