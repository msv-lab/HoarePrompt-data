Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y1` >= `y2`, then:
  - `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`.
  - `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
  - `a` is equal to `r[5] - 1`.
- Otherwise, if `y1` < `y2`, then:
  - `y1` is equal to `r[3] + 1`.
  - `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
  - `a` is equal to `r[1] - r[5]`.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
- `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variables `x1` and `x2`**:
   - `x1` is defined as `r[2] + 1 + a`.
   - `x2` is defined as `r[4] - a`.
   - The difference `b` between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, meaning `x2 - x1` is odd.

2. **Variables `y1` and `y2`**:
   - `y1` and `y2` are defined based on the condition `y1 >= y2` or `y1 < y2`.
   - If `y1 >= y2`:
     - `y1 = r[3] - 1`
     - `y2 = r[5]`
     - `a = r[5] - 1`
   - If `y1 < y2`:
     - `y1 = r[3] + 1`
     - `y2 = r[5]`
     - `a = r[1] - r[5]`
   - The number of test cases `t` is equal to the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.

3. **Conditions for `x1` and `x2`**:
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The `print('draw')` statement will always print the string `'draw'`.
- The conditions provided in the initial state ensure that the game is in a state where a draw is the only possible outcome. Specifically, the conditions on `x1` and `x2` (either `x2 <= x1`, `x1 < 1`, or `x2 > n`) indicate that the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips are such that they cannot move in a way that would result in a win.

### Final Output:
Output: **draw**
