Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. The function does not return any value, regardless of the input.**
