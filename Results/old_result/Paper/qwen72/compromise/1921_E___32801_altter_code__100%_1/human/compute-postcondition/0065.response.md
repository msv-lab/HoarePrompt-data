Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided to determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`.
- `y1` is equal to `r[3]`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- If `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, `a` is equal to `y1 - 1`.
- If `y2` is less than `y1`, `a` is equal to `m - y1`.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- The current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for `a`**:
   - If `y2 >= y1`, then `a = y1 - 1`.
   - If `y2 < y1`, then `a = m - y1`.

2. **Condition for `x1` and `x2`**:
   - `x1 = r[2] + a`.
   - `x2 = r[4] - a`.
   - `x2` must be greater than `x1`, and the difference `b = x2 - x1` must be even.
   - However, the precondition states that the current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

3. **Condition for `t`**:
   - `t = abs(y2 - y1)`.

### Conclusion:
The precondition explicitly states that the current value of `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`. This means that the conditions for `x1` and `x2` are not met, and the game is in a state where it cannot proceed normally.

Given this, the code will print 'draw' because the game is in a state where it cannot continue due to the invalid positions of the chips.

### Final Output:
Output: **draw**
