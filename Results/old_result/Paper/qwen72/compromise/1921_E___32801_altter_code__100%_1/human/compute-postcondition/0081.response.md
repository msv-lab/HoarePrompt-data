Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + a`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is equal to `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
- At least one of the following conditions is false:
  1. `b // 2 > a`
  2. `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c`
  3. `1 <= y1 <= m`
  4. `1 <= x1 <= n`

### Analysis:
- The `print('draw')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string `'draw'`.
- The conditions provided in the initial state are used to determine the values of the variables and the state of the program, but they do not affect the print statement itself.

### Conclusion:
The `print('draw')` statement will print the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions provided in the initial state.

Output: **draw**
