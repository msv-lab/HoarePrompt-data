The function `func_1` reads a single line of input containing six integers (n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2) and determines the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob. The game is played on a board of dimensions n x m, with Alice's chip initially at position (x1, y1) and Bob's chip at position (x2, y2). The function prints 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw' based on the positions and the rules of the game. The function does not return any value.
