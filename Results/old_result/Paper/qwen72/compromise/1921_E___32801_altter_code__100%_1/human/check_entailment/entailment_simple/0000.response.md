### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1()` but does not pass any parameters to it. The function should be defined with parameters to match the problem description, such as `def func_1(t, test_cases):`. However, the function is called without any arguments, which is incorrect based on the problem description.
   - The function reads input using `input().split()` and converts it to a list of integers. This is a valid way to read input, but it should be done within the context of the function parameters.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The first check `if (x2 <= x1):` correctly identifies the scenario where Bob's chip is already in or above Alice's chip, which results in a draw because Alice cannot move up.

3. **Odd Difference in Rows:**
   - The next block of code handles the case where the difference in rows between Bob's and Alice's chips is odd. This is a valid scenario because Alice and Bob will always be on different rows, and Alice can potentially win by aligning her chip with Bob's chip.
   - The program correctly checks if Alice can move her chip to the same column as Bob's chip and win. If not, it attempts to move Alice's chip to a position where she can still win by aligning her chip with Bob's chip after a series of moves.
   - The conditions and logic for determining if Alice can win or if the game ends in a draw are mostly correct, but there are some issues with the logic for updating `x1` and `x2` and the final win condition.

4. **Even Difference in Rows:**
   - The block of code for handling the case where the difference in rows between Bob's and Alice's chips is even is similar to the odd case but with some differences in the logic.
   - The program correctly checks if Bob can move his chip to the same column as Alice's chip and win. If not, it attempts to move Bob's chip to a position where he can still win by aligning his chip with Alice's chip after a series of moves.
   - The conditions and logic for determining if Bob can win or if the game ends in a draw are mostly correct, but there are some issues with the logic for updating `x1` and `x2` and the final win condition.

5. **Logical Errors:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the scenario where Alice or Bob cannot make a move. For example, if Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, the game should end in a draw, but this is not explicitly checked.
   - The logic for updating `x1` and `x2` and checking the win conditions is overly complex and may not cover all edge cases. For example, the conditions `b // 2 > a` and `abs(x2 - c) >= x1 + c` are not clearly explained and may not be correct for all scenarios.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct output for some test cases, but due to the logical errors mentioned, it may not produce the correct output for all test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has several logical errors and does not correctly handle all scenarios, particularly the conditions for a draw and the win conditions for both Alice and Bob. Additionally, the function should be defined with parameters to match the problem description, and the input should be handled within the function.
