Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 4 1 1 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
Draw
```

Actual Output:
The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game. The logic in the program is complex and seems to have several issues, particularly in the way it calculates and checks the positions of Alice and Bob. The specific issue in this case is that the program does not correctly account for the scenario where both players are in positions that prevent them from winning, leading to a draw. The program incorrectly modifies the positions of the chips in a way that does not reflect the optimal play described in the problem statement.
