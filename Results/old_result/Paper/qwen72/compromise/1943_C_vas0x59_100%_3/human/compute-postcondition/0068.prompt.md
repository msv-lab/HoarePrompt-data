Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The loop continues to append the value of `previous[path_ba[-1]]` to `path_ba` until `previous[path_ba[-1]]` is -1. At this point, the loop breaks. The final state of `path_ba` will contain the sequence of nodes from `b` to the starting node `a` in reverse order. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `a`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged. The values of `_`, `u`, and `v` are not affected by the loop and remain as `n - 2`, `u - (n - 1)`, and `v - (n - 1)` respectively. `ops` is an empty list. `ci2` is half the length of `path_ba` (an integer since the length of `path_ba` is even). `ci1` is `ci2 - 1`. `c1` is the value of `path_ba[ci1]`. `c2` is the value of `path_ba[ci2]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `path_ba` is a list with at least 3 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)` and `(c2, 1)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 3, `path_ba` is a list with at least 5 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, and `(c2, 3)`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 5, `path_ba` is a list with at least 9 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
