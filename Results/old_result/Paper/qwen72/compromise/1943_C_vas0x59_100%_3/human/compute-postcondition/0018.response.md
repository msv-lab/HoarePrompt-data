Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 2, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where the list at index `v` contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, and the list at index `u` now contains the integer `v` in addition to its previous contents, `_` is 2, `u` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `u - 3`, `v` is an integer read from the standard input and is now `v - 3`.**

Explanation:
- The code `u2vs[u].append(v)` appends the integer `v` to the list at index `u` in `u2vs`.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged.
- The value of `u2vs` is updated such that the list at index `u` now includes the integer `v`.
- The values of `u` and `v` remain `u - 3` and `v - 3` respectively, as they were already modified in the initial state.
- The value of `_` remains 2.
- The list at index `v` still contains the integer `u` in addition to its previous contents, as this was part of the initial state.
