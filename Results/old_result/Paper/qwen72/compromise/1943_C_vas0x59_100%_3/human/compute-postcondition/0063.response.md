Output State: **`i` is 3, `path_ba` is a list with at least 5 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, and `(ci1, 3)`**

Explanation: The code appends the tuple `(ci1, i)` to the list `ops`. Given that `i` is 3 and `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, the new tuple `(ci1, 3)` is added to `ops`. The other variables remain unchanged.
