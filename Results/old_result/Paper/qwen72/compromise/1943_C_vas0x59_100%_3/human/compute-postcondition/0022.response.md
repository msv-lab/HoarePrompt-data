Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list at index `i` contains the indices of the nodes that are connected to node `i` (0-indexed), `_` is `n - 2`, `u` and `v` are the last integers read from the standard input and are now `u - (n - 1)` and `v - (n - 1)` respectively, `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node 0, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state remains unchanged for `n`, `u2vs`, `_`, `u`, `v`, and `d`.
- The variable `a` is assigned the result of the function `func_1` when called with the argument `d`.
- Since `d` is the result of the `bfs` function starting from node 0, and `func_1` is applied to `d`, `a` now holds the value returned by `func_1(d)`.
- No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
