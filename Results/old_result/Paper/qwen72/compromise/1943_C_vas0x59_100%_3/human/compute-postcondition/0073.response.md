The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It internally reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which represents the number of vertices in a tree, with the constraint that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^3. It then reads `n - 1` lines from the standard input, each containing two integers `u` and `v` (1 <= u, v <= n, u != v) representing an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. The input is assumed to form a valid tree. After processing this input, the function returns `None`.

Functionality: **The function reads a tree structure from the standard input, where the number of vertices `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^3, and `n - 1` edges are specified between the vertices. It processes this tree and returns `None`.**
