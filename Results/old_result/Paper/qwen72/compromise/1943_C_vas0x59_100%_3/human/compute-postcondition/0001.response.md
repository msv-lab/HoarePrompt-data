Output State: **`n` is a specific integer value read from the standard input, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.**

The value of `n` remains the same as it was read from the standard input. The variable `u2vs` is now a list containing `n` empty lists, where each list corresponds to a vertex in the tree and will eventually store the vertices connected to it by edges.
