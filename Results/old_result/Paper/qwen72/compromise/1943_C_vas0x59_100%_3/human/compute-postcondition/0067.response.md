Output State: **`i` is 5, `path_ba` is a list with at least 9 elements, `ci1` is `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(ci1, 1)`, `(c2, 1)`, `(ci1, 3)`, `(c2, 3)`, `(c1, 5)`, and `(c2, 5)`**. 

The value of `i` remains 5, `path_ba` still has at least 9 elements, `ci1` is still `(len(path_ba) // 2) - 1`, and `ops` now includes an additional tuple `(c2, 5)`.
