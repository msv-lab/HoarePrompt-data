Reasoning:  
The program's goal is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program, however, always prints the same pattern for each \(n\): it prints the coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\). This means all the points are on the first row of the grid.

Let's analyze the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for this pattern:
- The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \(|1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j|\).
- The possible values of \(|i - j|\) range from 0 to \(n-1\) (since \(i\) and \(j\) are both in the range from 1 to \(n\)).

Thus, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all integers from 0 to \(n-1\), which means the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(n\).

However, the problem states that the goal is to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For \(n \geq 3\), it is possible to achieve a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances by placing points in a more strategic manner. For example, placing points in a diagonal pattern or a pattern that covers more rows and columns can result in a larger set of distinct distances.

For \(n = 2\), the program's output is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is indeed 2, and the output \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) achieves this.

For \(n \geq 3\), the program's output is not correct because it does not maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For instance, for \(n = 3\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```
The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for this output is \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), which has a size of 3. However, a better arrangement could be:
```
1 1
2 3
3 1
```
The set \(\mathcal{H}\) for this arrangement is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for \(n \geq 3\).

Correctness: **False**
