Output: **1**

Explanation:
The `print` statement in the given code snippet is `print('1', end=' ')`. This statement prints the string `'1'` and uses a space as the ending character instead of a newline. The values of the variables `t`, `n`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because they are not used within it. Therefore, the output will always be `1` followed by a space.
