The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`, so `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 0 <= t <= 49, `n` is an integer input by the user for the current test case and must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3**
