Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` (1 to 50) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 to 1000) and prints a sequence of numbers. Specifically, for each `n`, it prints '1' followed by each integer from 1 to `n` on separate lines. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the function has no return value. **
