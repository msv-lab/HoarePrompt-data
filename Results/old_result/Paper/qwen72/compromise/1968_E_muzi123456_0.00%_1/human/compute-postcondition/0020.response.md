Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(0 \leq t \leq 48\).
- `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(i)
```

Since the value of `i` is explicitly given as 1, the `print` statement will output the value of `i`.

Output: **1**
