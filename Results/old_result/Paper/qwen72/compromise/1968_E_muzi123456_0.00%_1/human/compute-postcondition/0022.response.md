The `print` statement in the provided code snippet will print the string `'1'` and will not move the cursor to the next line because of the `end=' '` parameter, which specifies that a space should be used as the end character instead of a newline.

The variables `t`, `n`, and `i` are mentioned in the initial state, but they are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, their values do not affect the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **1** (followed by a space)
