Reasoning:

The program provided is intended to solve the problem of generating a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. However, the approach taken in the program is flawed:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments. This is incorrect because `func_1()` should take `n` and `k` as parameters.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads `n` and `k` from the input, which is correct.
   - It then constructs a string `s` by taking the first `k` characters of the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` and repeating this substring `n` times.
   - This approach does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets will be subsequences of `s`.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`, the string `s` should be constructed in such a way that it contains all possible combinations of these characters.
   - A correct approach would be to generate a de Bruijn sequence of order `n` on an alphabet of size `k`. A de Bruijn sequence of order `n` on an alphabet of size `k` is a cyclic sequence in which every possible string of length `n` appears as a substring (and hence as a subsequence).

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 2`, the correct output is `ab` because it contains all possible strings of length 1 using the first 2 alphabets (`a` and `b`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 1`, the correct output is `aa` because it contains the only possible string of length 2 using the first 1 alphabet (`a`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the correct output is `baab` because it contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 alphabets (`aa`, `ab`, `ba`, `bb`).
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the correct output is `abcbac` because it contains all possible strings of length 2 using the first 3 alphabets (`aa`, `ab`, `ac`, `ba`, `bb`, `bc`, `ca`, `cb`, `cc`).

The current implementation of `func_1()` does not generate a de Bruijn sequence or any other sequence that guarantees the presence of all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
