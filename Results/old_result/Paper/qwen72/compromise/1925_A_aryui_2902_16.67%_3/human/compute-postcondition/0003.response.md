The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26. The function returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of the alphabet string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26. It returns a string that consists of the first `k` characters of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw' repeated `n` times.**
