The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `row` and a positive integer `d` (1 <= d < len(row)). It modifies the elements of `row` such that the first `d` elements are incremented by specific values (the first element is set to 1, and each subsequent element up to `d-1` is incremented by 2). For each element from index `d` to the end of the list, the value is updated to the sum of the smallest element in a sliding window of size `d` (from the beginning of the list up to the current index) plus the current element plus 1. The function returns the last element of the modified `row` list.
