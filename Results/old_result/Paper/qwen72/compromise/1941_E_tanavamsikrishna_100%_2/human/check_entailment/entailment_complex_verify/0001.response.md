### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for \( k \) bridges on consecutive rows of a grid.
   - Each bridge must have supports at the first and last columns, and the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \( d \).
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell \((i, j)\) is \( a_{i,j} + 1 \).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**
   - **Initialization:**
     - The function sets the cost of the first cell to 1, which is correct because \( a_{i,1} = 0 \) and the cost is \( a_{i,1} + 1 \).
     - It then iterates through the first \( d \) cells, adding 2 to each cell's depth. This is incorrect. The cost for each cell should be \( a_{i,j} + 1 \), not \( a_{i,j} + 2 \). The extra 1 is not justified.
   - **Min-Heap Usage:**
     - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum costs of the first \( d \) cells.
     - For each subsequent cell, the function ensures that the distance between the current cell and the closest support is no more than \( d \) by popping elements from the heap until the condition is met.
     - The cost for the current cell is then calculated as the minimum cost from the heap plus the cost of the current cell.
     - The function returns the cost of the last cell.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - **Input Reading:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases \( t \).
     - For each test case, it reads the grid dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), the number of bridges \( k \), and the maximum distance \( d \).
   - **Cost Calculation:**
     - It reads the grid and calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It then calculates the total cost for building \( k \) consecutive bridges by summing the costs of \( k \) consecutive rows.
     - Finally, it prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of \( k \) consecutive rows.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The function correctly initializes the first cell's cost to 1.
     - The function incorrectly adds 2 to the costs of the first \( d \) cells. This should be \( a_{i,j} + 1 \) instead of \( a_{i,j} + 2 \).
     - The use of a min-heap ensures that the minimum cost for the current cell is always chosen, and the distance condition is maintained.
     - The function correctly returns the cost of the last cell.
   - **Function 2:**
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
     - It correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`, but the incorrect cost calculation in `func_1` affects the results.
     - It correctly calculates the total cost for \( k \) consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.
     - The function prints the correct output for each test case, but the output is based on incorrect costs.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the mistake in the cost calculation in `func_1`. The extra 1 added to the costs of the first \( d \) cells is not justified and leads to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
