### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the standard input.
   - It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` integers, to form the `rows` list, which represents the depths of the river cells in a grid.

2. **Cost Calculation for Each Row**:
   - `func_2` calls `func_1` for each row in `rows` to compute the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - `func_1` modifies the row to ensure the conditions for support installation are met:
     - The first element is set to 1 (cost of the first support).
     - The next `d-1` elements are incremented by 2 (cost of the supports plus the depth).
     - For each element from index `d` to the end, the function uses a min-heap to find the minimum cost of the previous `d` elements and adds this to the current element plus 1.
     - The function returns the last element of the modified row, which represents the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

3. **Total Cost Calculation for Consecutive Rows**:
   - `func_2` computes the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of each possible sequence of `k` rows.
   - It stores these sums in `total_costs` and prints the minimum value from this list.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem constraints are handled correctly:
     - `1 <= k <= n` ensures that `k` is within the number of rows.
     - `1 <= d <= m` ensures that `d` is within the number of columns.
   - The first and last elements of each row are 0, which is correctly handled by the input format and the logic in `func_1`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of a min-heap in `func_1` ensures that the function efficiently finds the minimum cost within a sliding window of size `d`.
   - The overall complexity of the program is manageable given the constraints, especially since the sum of `n * m` for all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges on the river grid, adhering to the given constraints and conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
