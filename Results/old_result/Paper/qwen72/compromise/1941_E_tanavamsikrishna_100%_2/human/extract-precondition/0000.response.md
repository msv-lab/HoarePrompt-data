Precondition: **No variables are passed in the function signature. The function reads input values for n, m, k, d, and rows from stdin. n and m are positive integers, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and d is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. rows is a list of n lists, each containing m integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the first and last elements of each list being 0.**
