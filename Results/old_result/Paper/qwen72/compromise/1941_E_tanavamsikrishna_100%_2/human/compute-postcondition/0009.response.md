Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`, `i` is 2, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing three elements, where the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs`, the second element is the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`, and the third element is the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`.**

Explanation:
- The code `total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))` appends the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of the `costs` list to `total_costs`.
- The initial state specifies that `total_costs` already contains two elements: the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`.
- After executing the code, `total_costs` now contains three elements, with the third element being the same sum as the second element, since the slice `costs[i:i + k]` is the same as the slice used to compute the second element.
