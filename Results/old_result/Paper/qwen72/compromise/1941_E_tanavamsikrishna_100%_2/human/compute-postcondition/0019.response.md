Output State: **The `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from the first `d` elements of `row` and its corresponding index, and `min_heap` is now a valid min-heap with the tuple `e` added. The variable `i` remains `d`. The loop has removed all tuples from `min_heap` where the index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The `heappush(min_heap, e)` function adds the tuple `e` to the `min_heap` and maintains the heap property.
- The variable `i` remains `d`.
- The loop condition that removes tuples from `min_heap` where the index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` is still valid.
- The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, which is a specific calculation based on the tuple `e` and the current value of `row[i]`.
