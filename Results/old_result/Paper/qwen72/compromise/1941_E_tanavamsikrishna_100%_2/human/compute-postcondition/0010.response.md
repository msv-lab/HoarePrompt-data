Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`, `i` is `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, where each element is the sum of a contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from `costs`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- `n` remains a positive integer such that `n >= k`.
- `i` has reached the value `len(costs) - (k - 1)`, which is the last index where the loop can still take a subsequence of `k` elements from `costs`.
- `k` and `d` remain unchanged, with `k` being a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n and `d` being a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m.
- `rows` remains a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers.
- `costs` remains a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`.
- `total_costs` is a list containing `len(costs) - (k - 1)` elements, where each element is the sum of a contiguous subsequence of `k` elements from `costs`. This means that `total_costs` contains the sum of the first `k` elements, the sum of the second `k` elements, and so on, until the last possible subsequence of `k` elements in `costs`.
