Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `row` is a list of integers representing the depths of a row in the river grid, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d < len(row), and for each index `i` in the range 1 to `d-1`, `row[i]` is increased by 2. `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from the first `d` elements of `row` and its corresponding index, and `min_heap` is now a valid min-heap.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(d, len(row)):
    while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
        pass
    row[i] = e[0] + row[i] + 1
    heappush(min_heap, e)
    heappush(min_heap, (row[i], i))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The `min_heap` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from the first `d` elements of `row` and its corresponding index, and `min_heap` is now a valid min-heap with the tuple `(row[i], i)` added. The variable `i` remains `d`. The loop has removed all tuples from `min_heap` where the index is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The loop has finished executing, and `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with the tuple `(row[i], i)` added to it. The variable `i` is still `d + 1`, and `row[i]` has been updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1` again.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `min_heap` is a valid min-heap with the element `e` added and the new element `(row[i], i)` added, `i` is `d + 2`, `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`, and there are no tuples `(value, index)` in `min_heap` where `index <= 0`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
