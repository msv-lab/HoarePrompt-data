Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= k`, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m, `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers, `costs` is a list of `n` elements, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each `row` in `rows`, `total_costs` is a list containing two elements, where the first element is the sum of the first `k` elements of `costs` and the second element is the sum of the elements from index `i` to `i + k - 1` of `costs`.**
