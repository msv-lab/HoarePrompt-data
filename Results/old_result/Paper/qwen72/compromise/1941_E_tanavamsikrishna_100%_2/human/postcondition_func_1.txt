The function `func_2` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from standard input, where `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the dimensions of a grid, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, and `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= m. It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `m` integers, to form a list of lists called `rows`. Each inner list in `rows` represents the depths of the river cells in a row, with the first and last elements being 0. The function computes the cost for each row using the `func_1` function and stores these costs in a list called `costs`. It then calculates the sum of every contiguous subsequence of `k` elements in `costs` and stores these sums in a list called `total_costs`. Finally, the function prints the minimum value from `total_costs`.
