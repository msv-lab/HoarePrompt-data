Postcondition: ***`A` is a positive integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where `g[1]` must be a non-empty list, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k < n, `stack` is a list containing the tuple (1, 1). If `node` is not equal to `p`, `stack` also contains the tuple (node, x), and `visited` is a set containing the integer 1, `d` is a dictionary with the key (1) and the value 1, `r` is 0, `x` is 1, `p` is 1, and `x` is in `visited`. If `node` is equal to `p`, the variables and their values remain unchanged.***
