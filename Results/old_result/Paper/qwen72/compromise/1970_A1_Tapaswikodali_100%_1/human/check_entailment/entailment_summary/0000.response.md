Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to take a balanced parentheses sequence and apply a balanced shuffle operation to it.
   - The balanced shuffle operation involves computing the balance of each prefix, sorting the characters based on the balance and position, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` is a comparison function used for sorting.
   - It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their `balance` attribute.
   - If the `balance` attributes are different, it returns the difference between them.
   - If the `balance` attributes are the same, it returns the difference between the positions in reverse order (i.e., `infoB.position - infoA.position`).

3. **Analyzing `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` processes the input string `s` and constructs a list of `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - It iterates through the string, maintaining a running balance of parentheses.
   - For each character, it appends a `BalanceInfo` object to the list with the current balance, position, and character.
   - After constructing the list, it sorts the `BalanceInfo` objects using the comparison function `func_1`.
   - Finally, it constructs the result string by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects and prints it.

4. **Verification**:
   - The `BalanceInfo` class correctly stores the balance, position, and character.
   - The `func_1` function correctly implements the sorting logic as required by the problem: first by balance in ascending order, and then by position in descending order if the balances are equal.
   - The `func_2` function correctly computes the balance for each prefix and constructs the `BalanceInfo` objects.
   - The sorting step in `func_2` uses the correct key function to sort the `BalanceInfo` objects as specified.
   - The result string is constructed by concatenating the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects, which should produce the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `(()(()))`:
     - The balance table is:
       ```
       Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1
       ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
       Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8
       Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )
       ```
     - After sorting:
       ```
       Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3
       ---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
       Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6
       Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )
       ```
     - The result is `()(()())`, which matches the expected output.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
