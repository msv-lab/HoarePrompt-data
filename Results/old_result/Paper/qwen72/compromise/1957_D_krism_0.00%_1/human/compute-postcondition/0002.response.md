The code snippet `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, converts each string into an integer, and stores these integers in the list `arr`.

Given the initial state:
- The function should accept parameters for the number of test cases and the arrays of integers, but the provided function definition is incomplete. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
- `n` is an input integer.

The code snippet does not affect the function definition or the parameters `t` and `test_cases`. It only affects the variable `arr` by assigning it the list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, `n` is an input integer, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.**
