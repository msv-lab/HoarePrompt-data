The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The list `a` represents the periodicities of the signs, and its length is equal to `n`. Each element `a_i` in the list `a` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.
