Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the list to extract the number of test cases (`T`) and the details of each test case (number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a`).

2. **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, the program:
   - Reads the number of signs `n`.
   - Reads the periodicities of the signs `a`.
   - Initializes `last_year` to the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - For each subsequent sign (from the second to the nth sign), the program calculates the next year in which the sign will occur. This is done using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year + 1`.

4. **Updating the Last Year**:
   - After calculating the next year for the current sign, the program updates `last_year` to `next_year`.

5. **Storing Results**:
   - The final year for each test case is stored in the `results` list as a string.

6. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program writes the results to `sys.stdout` in the required format.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It ensures that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one and calculates the year when the nth sign will occur. The input and output handling is also correct, matching the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
