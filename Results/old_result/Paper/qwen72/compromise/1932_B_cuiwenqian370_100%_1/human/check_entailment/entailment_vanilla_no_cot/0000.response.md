Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Test Case Loop**: The program iterates over each test case, extracting the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign**:
   - The program initializes `last_year` with the value of the first sign's periodicity `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur, ensuring that it is strictly after the last year the previous sign occurred. This is done using the formula:
     \[
     \text{next\_year} = \left(\frac{\text{last\_year} + 1 + \text{a[i]} - 1}{\text{a[i]}}\right) \times \text{a[i]}
     \]
     This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

4. **Storing and Outputting Results**: The program appends the final year for each test case to the `results` list and writes the results to `sys.stdout` in the required format.

The logic and implementation are correct and match the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
