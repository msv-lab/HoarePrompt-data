Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `queue` is a deque containing a single tuple `(start, 0)`.** 

The initial state remains unchanged except that the `queue` is now initialized as a deque with a single element, which is a tuple containing the `start` node and the integer `0`.
