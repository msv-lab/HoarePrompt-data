Postcondition: ***`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, but with the first element removed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. `current` is now the first neighbor that was in the `queue` before the operation, and `dist` is the distance associated with that neighbor. `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor in `tree[current]`.***
