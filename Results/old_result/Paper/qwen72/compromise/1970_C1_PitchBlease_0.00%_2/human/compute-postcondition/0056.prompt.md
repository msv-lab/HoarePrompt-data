Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, but with the first element removed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. `current` is now the first neighbor that was in the `queue` before the operation, and `dist` is the distance associated with that neighbor. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns the distance `dist`, which is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph represented by `tree`. Otherwise, the loop continues until all reachable nodes have been visited or the `queue` is empty.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, but with the first element removed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. If the `neighbor` being considered is not in the `visited` set, then `visited` now includes this `neighbor`, and `queue` contains the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` at its end. `current` is now the first neighbor that was in the `queue` before the operation, and `dist` is the distance associated with that neighbor. `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, but with the first element removed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop, plus the `neighbor` that was just added. `current` is now the first neighbor that was in the `queue` before the operation, and `dist` is the distance associated with that neighbor. `tree[current]` must have at least one neighbor, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `tree[current]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, but with the first element removed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` now includes the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `neighbor` is added to `visited`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. `current` is now the first neighbor that was in the `queue` before the operation, and `dist` is the distance associated with that neighbor. `tree[current]` must have at least two neighbors, and `neighbor` is the second neighbor in `tree[current]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
