Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially. `current` is equal to `start`, `dist` is 0, and `current` is not equal to `target`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all neighbors of the `start` node.
- For each neighbor that is not already in the `visited` set, the neighbor is added to `visited`, and the tuple `(neighbor, 1)` is appended to `queue`.
- After all iterations, `visited` will contain `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially.
- `queue` will contain tuples `(neighbor, 1)` for all these neighbors.
- The variables `start`, `target`, `tree`, `current`, and `dist` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
