Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially, and it must contain at least one element, but the first element has been removed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially. `current` is the first neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited` initially, and `dist` is 1. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns 1. Otherwise, `current` is not equal to `target` and the function does not return 1.
Code of the loop:
for neighbor in tree[current]:
    if neighbor not in visited:
        visited.add(neighbor)
        queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially, and it must contain at least one element but the first element has been removed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially, including `current`. `current` is the first neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited` initially, `dist` is 1, `current` is not equal to `target`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `queue` now contains the tuple `(neighbor, 2)` at the end.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially, and it now contains at least one element but the first element has been removed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to `queue`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially, including `current`. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, `neighbor` is also added to `visited`. `current` is the first neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited` initially, `dist` is 1, `current` is not equal to `target`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, and `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not been processed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph, `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, 1)` for all neighbors of `start` that were not in `visited` initially, and it now contains at least one element but the first element has been removed. If `neighbor` is not in `visited`, the tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)` has been appended to `queue`, and `neighbor` has been added to `visited`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all its neighbors that were not in `visited` initially, including `current`. `current` is the first neighbor of `start` that was not in `visited` initially, `dist` is 1, `current` is not equal to `target`, `tree[current]` must contain at least one element, and `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[current]` that has not been processed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
