Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is a dictionary representing a graph. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of the form `(neighbor, distance)` for all neighbors of `start` and their respective distances from `start`, but with the first element removed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, including all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. `current` is now the first neighbor that was in the `queue` before the operation, and `dist` is the distance associated with that neighbor. If `current` equals `target`, the function returns `dist`. Otherwise, the loop continues until all reachable nodes have been visited or the `queue` is empty. The `queue` must contain at least one element.**
