You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers such that 1 <= start, target <= n, and tree is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `start` and `target` remain integers such that 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`. `tree` is still a dictionary representing the graph. `queue` is now an empty deque, indicating that all reachable nodes have been processed. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start` and all nodes that have been visited, which includes all neighbors of `start` and their neighbors that were processed during the loop. If `target` was found, the function returned the distance `dist`, which is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph. If `target` was not found, the function exits the loop without returning a distance, and `current` and `dist` will be the last processed node and its distance from `start`, respectively.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the graph, and the search concluded without finding a path from the start node to the target node.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integer parameters `start` and `target`, and a dictionary `tree` representing a graph. It returns 0 in some unspecified case, 1 in another unspecified case, the shortest path distance from `start` to `target` if `target` is found, or the distance to the first node processed from the queue if `target` is not immediately found. If the target node is not found in the graph, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns 1.

Case_3: The program returns the distance `dist` associated with the current node `current` from the `start` node. If `current` equals `target`, this distance is the shortest path from `start` to `target` in the graph represented by `tree`. If `current` does not equal `target`, the returned distance is the distance to the first node processed from the `queue` after the first element was removed.

Case_4: The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the graph, and the search concluded without finding a path from the start node to the target node.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
