The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree representation from the `edges` list, identifies the leaf nodes, and performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first two leaf nodes. The function returns 'Ron' if the distance to either of the first two leaf nodes is even, and 'Hermione' if both distances are odd.
