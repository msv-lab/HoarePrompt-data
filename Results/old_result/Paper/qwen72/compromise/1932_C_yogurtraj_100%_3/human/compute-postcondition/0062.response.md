Postcondition: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` zeros where the last element is set to `k`, `k` is set to `a[l] % m` because the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q1` is set to `l - 1` because the last character of `t` is not 'L', `q2` is set to `l + 1` because the last character of `t` is not 'L', and the current character `t[i]` is 'R'.**
