Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `t` is a user input string, `l` is the number of times the character 'L' appears in the string `t`, `y` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the updated value of `k` at each iteration, starting from the last element and moving backwards, `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, `q1` and `q2` are updated based on the conditions described in the loop, but their final values depend on the specific characters in `t` and the length of `t`. The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation:
- The initial values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `y`, `k`, `q1`, and `q2` remain unchanged except for `n` and `m`.
- The line `n, m = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `m` to the integers provided by the user input.
- The new values of `n` and `m` are now the integers provided by the user, but they still adhere to the conditions that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `m` is greater than 0.
