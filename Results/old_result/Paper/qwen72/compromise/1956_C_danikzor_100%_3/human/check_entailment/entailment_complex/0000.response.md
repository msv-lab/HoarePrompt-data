### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations involve either setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer \( n \) from the input.
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \).
   - It then prints the maximum sum and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - The function proceeds to perform \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation (setting the \( i \)-th row to a permutation from \( n \) to 1).
     - For each \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation (setting the \( i \)-th column to a permutation from \( n \) to 1).

3. **Verification of the Formula**:
   - The formula \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \) is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and their permutations. This formula correctly calculates the maximum sum of the matrix when each row and column is filled with the permutation from \( n \) to 1.

4. **Verification of Operations**:
   - The function performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each row and each column is set to the permutation from \( n \) to 1, ensuring that the matrix is filled with the highest possible values.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format is correct: it prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the details of each operation in the required format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \( n = 1 \), the function correctly prints \( 1 \) as the maximum sum and \( 1 \) operation.
   - For \( n = 2 \), the function correctly prints \( 7 \) as the maximum sum and \( 4 \) operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem by maximizing the sum of the matrix using the specified operations and adhering to the constraints. The formula and the operations are both correct and efficient.
