### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements using the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, which is `2 * n`.
   - It then performs `2 * n` operations:
     - For each row `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
     - For each column `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs a Type 2 operation using the same permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.

3. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` squares. The sum of the first `n` natural numbers is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and the sum of the first `n` squares is `n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6`.
   - However, the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` is not the correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix, when each row and each column is filled with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`, is `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`. This is because each element in the matrix will be a number from 1 to `n`, and there are `n` rows and `n` columns, so the total sum is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers multiplied by `n`.

4. **Operations:**
   - The program performs `2 * n` operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - Each Type 1 operation fills a row with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - Each Type 2 operation fills a column with the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - Since the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]` is used for both rows and columns, the matrix will be filled with the maximum possible values, but the sum calculation is incorrect.

5. **Output:**
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem requirements.
   - The maximum sum is printed first, followed by the number of operations.
   - Each operation is printed with the correct type, index, and permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly performs the operations to fill the matrix with the maximum possible values, but the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct formula should be `n * (n + 1) * n // 2`.

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
