#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a matrix and operations, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t` and the size of the matrix `n` for each test case.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n (where n is the input integer)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all its iterations, printing two lines for each value of `i` from 1 to `n`. Each line consists of the number 1 or 2 followed by the value of `i` and then a sequence of integers from `n` to 1. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, prints a tuple containing two values: the first value is the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and the second value is `2 * n`. It then enters a loop that iterates from 1 to `n`, printing two lines for each iteration: the first line starts with `1` followed by the current loop index `i` and a sequence of integers from `n` to 1; the second line starts with `2` followed by the current loop index `i` and the same sequence of integers from `n` to 1. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `n` remains unchanged.
