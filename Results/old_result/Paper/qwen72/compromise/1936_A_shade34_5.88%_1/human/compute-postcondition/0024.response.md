Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `i` is 0, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `pans` is an empty list.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
