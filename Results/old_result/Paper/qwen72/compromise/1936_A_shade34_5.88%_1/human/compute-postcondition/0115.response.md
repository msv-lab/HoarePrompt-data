Postcondition: ***`pans` is either an empty list, a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `=`, or a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<`. `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `n` is an input integer greater than 1. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 1. If `s` is `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values. If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` was `=`.***
