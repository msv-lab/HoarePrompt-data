Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mak` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `mak` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution. Since the exact user inputs are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `mak`, but we know it is an integer.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`. Therefore, `mak2` will have the same value as `mak`.
   - `i` is 0, as given in the initial state.
   - `mak2` is again equal to `mak`.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string starting with `?`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.
   - Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same, they will both be printed as the same value.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be a string that includes the question mark `?`, followed by the value of `mak` (which is the largest index for which the user input was `<`), then the value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`), then the value of `i` (which is 0), and finally the value of `mak2` (which is the same as `mak`).

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution)**
