Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least 2 elements.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `mak` is 0, so `pans[mak]` will be the first element of the `pans` list.
   - `i` is 1, so `pans[i]` will be the second element of the `pans` list.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a string that starts with `?`.
   - It will then print the first element of `pans` twice.
   - It will then print the second element of `pans` twice.

Since `pans` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and we know the values of `mak` and `i`, we can determine the exact elements that will be printed.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[1]] [pans[1]] (where [pans[0]] is the first element of the `pans` list and [pans[1]] is the second element of the `pans` list)**
