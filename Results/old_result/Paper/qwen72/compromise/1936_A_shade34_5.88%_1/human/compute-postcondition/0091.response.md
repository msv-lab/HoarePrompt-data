Postcondition: ***`pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 3, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 3, `n` is an input integer greater than 3, and the user input is a string. If the user input is `<`, `mak` was originally set to 1 but is now 3. Otherwise, `mak` was originally 0 but is now 3.***
