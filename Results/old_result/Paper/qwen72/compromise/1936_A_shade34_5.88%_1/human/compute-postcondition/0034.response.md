The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer input such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is `<`, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is not `<`, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution (or 0 if no user input was `<`), `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `pans` is an empty list if `s` is not equal to `=`, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is equal to `=`.**
