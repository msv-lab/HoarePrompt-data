Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak` is 1 if the user input is `>` for the current iteration, otherwise `mak` remains 0.
   - `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution.
   - `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least 3 elements.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output a string that starts with `?` followed by four elements from the `pans` list.
   - The first two elements are `pans[mak]`.
   - The last two elements are `pans[i]`.

4. **Values of Variables:**
   - `mak` can be either 0 or 1, depending on the user input.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `pans` is a list with at least 3 elements, and each element is an index where the user input was `=` or `<`.

5. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `mak` is 0, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
   - If `mak` is 1, then `pans[mak]` is `pans[1]`.
   - `pans[i]` is `pans[2]`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - If `mak` is 0, the output will be `? pans[0] pans[0] pans[2] pans[2]`.
   - If `mak` is 1, the output will be `? pans[1] pans[1] pans[2] pans[2]`.

Since the exact values of `pans[0]`, `pans[1]`, and `pans[2]` are not provided, we can only describe them in terms of their positions in the `pans` list.

Output: **? pans[mak] pans[mak] pans[2] pans[2] (where `pans[mak]` is the element at index `mak` in the `pans` list, and `pans[2]` is the element at index 2 in the `pans` list)**
