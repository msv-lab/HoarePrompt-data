The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute a number of times equal to the value provided by `int(input())`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements
- `i` is `n-1`
- The output buffer has been flushed
- `mak` remains unchanged

For the loop to execute one more time, the user must input a value greater than 0. The loop does not depend on the variables `pans`, `i`, `mak`, or the state of the output buffer. It only depends on the value provided by `int(input())`.

State: **`pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is `n-1`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` remains unchanged. The user must input a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute one more time.**
