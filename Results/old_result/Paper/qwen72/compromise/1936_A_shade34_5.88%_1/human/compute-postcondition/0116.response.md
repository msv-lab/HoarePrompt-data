The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an input integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`pans` is either an empty list, a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `=`, or a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `<`. `i` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `n` is an input integer greater than 2. If the new `s` is `<`, `mak` is 1 and `mak2` is 1. If `s` is `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values. If `s` is neither `<` nor `=`, `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values, and `pans` remains either an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` was `=`.**
