Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `s` is the user input string.
   - If `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[1]`.
   - If `s` is `=`, `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1]`.
   - If `s` is any other value, `pans` remains an empty list.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output a string starting with `?`.
   - `mak` is the largest index for which the user input was `<`.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `mak2` is repeated in the print statement.

4. **Output:**
   - The first part of the output will be `?`.
   - The second part will be the value of `mak`.
   - The third part will be the value of `mak2`, which is the same as `mak`.
   - The fourth part will be the value of `i`, which is 2.
   - The fifth part will be the value of `mak2` again, which is the same as `mak`.

Since `mak` and `mak2` are the same and represent the largest index for which the user input was `<`, the output will be:

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 2 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution)**
