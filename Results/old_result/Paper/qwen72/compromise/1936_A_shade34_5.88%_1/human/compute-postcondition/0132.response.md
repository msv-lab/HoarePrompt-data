Postcondition: ***`pans` contains the indices for which the user input was `=`, `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `mak2` is equal to the largest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0. If the user's current input is `>`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
