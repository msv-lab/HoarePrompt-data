Let's analyze the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations. Since the exact user inputs are not provided, we can only describe `mak` in terms of the loop iterations and user inputs.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `i` is 0, as given in the initial state.
   - The string `'?'` is a literal question mark.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will output a question mark followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` in that order.
   - Since `i` is 0 and `mak2` is equal to `mak`, the output will be: `? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak]`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The exact value of `mak` is not known without the user inputs, but it is described as the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations.

Output: **? [mak] [mak] 0 [mak] (where [mak] is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations)**
