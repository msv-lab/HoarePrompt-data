Let's analyze the given Python code snippet step by step:

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
```

Explanation:
1. The `print` statement is printing a string that starts with a question mark `?`.
2. The variable `mak` is referenced twice in the `print` statement. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the value of `mak`.
3. The variable `i` is referenced twice in the `print` statement. According to the initial state, `i` is 1.

Since the value of `mak` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. However, we can describe it as an unknown variable.

Final Output:
Output: **? [mak] [mak] 1 1 (where [mak] is the value of the variable `mak`)**
