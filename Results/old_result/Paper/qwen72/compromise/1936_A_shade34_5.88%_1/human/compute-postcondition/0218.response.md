Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is the final index of the loop (which is `len(pans) - 1`), `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>`, `mak2` is the largest index for which the user input was `<` during the loop execution, `pans` is a list containing all indices for which the user input was `=` or `<` during the loop execution and must have at least `n` elements, the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` command ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions remain the same.
