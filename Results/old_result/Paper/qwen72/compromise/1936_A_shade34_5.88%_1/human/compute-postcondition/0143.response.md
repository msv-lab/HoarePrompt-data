Output State: **`pans` must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `mak2` is equal to the largest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, `n` is an input integer greater than 0. If the user's input was `>` at any iteration, `mak` is set to the index of the last iteration where `>` was input. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `pans` must have at least as many elements as its length.
- The loop variable `i` will have reached the value `len(pans) - 1`, which is the last index of the list `pans`.
- The variable `mak2` will still be equal to the largest index for which the user input was `<`.
- The output buffer will have been flushed after each iteration.
- The variable `n` will still be an input integer greater than 0.
- The variable `mak` will be updated to the index of the last iteration where the user input was `>`. If no `>` was ever input, `mak` will remain 0.
