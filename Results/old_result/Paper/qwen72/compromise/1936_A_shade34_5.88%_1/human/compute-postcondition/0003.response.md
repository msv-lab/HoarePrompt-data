The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1. The variable `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n-1`. The variables `_` and `mak` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `i` is 1**
