Output State: **`pans` contains the indices for which the user input was `=`, `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the largest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `n` is an input integer greater than 0.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
