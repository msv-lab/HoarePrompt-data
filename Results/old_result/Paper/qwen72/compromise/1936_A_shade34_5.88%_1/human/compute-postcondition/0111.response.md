Output State: **`pans` is either an empty list or a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `=`, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `mak2` is equal to the original value of `mak` (which was the largest integer `i` for which the user input was `<` during the loop iterations), and `s` is the new user input string. If the new `s` is `<`, `pans` is a list containing `[0]`, `mak` is 1, and `mak2` is 1. Otherwise, `pans` remains an empty list or contains `[0]` if `s` is `=`, and `mak` and `mak2` retain their original values.**
