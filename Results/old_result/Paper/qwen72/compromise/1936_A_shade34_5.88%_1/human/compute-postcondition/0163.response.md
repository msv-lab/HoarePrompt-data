Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 3, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to '<', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 2.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` to `mak`. Since `i` is 3, `mak` is now 3. The other conditions and values in the initial state remain unchanged.
