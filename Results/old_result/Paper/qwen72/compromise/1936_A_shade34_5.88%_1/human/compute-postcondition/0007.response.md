Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 1, `i` is 1, the output buffer has been flushed, and the user input is a string that is equal to `<`.**

The value of `mak` is updated to 1, as it is assigned the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
