The only objects in the loop head are the variable `r` and the list `results`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. Before the loop starts, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `results` list must have at least one element, and `r` is the first element of the `results` list.

State: **`start` and `end` remain unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `results` is a list containing at least one element ('yes' or 'no'), `r` is the first element of the `results` list**
