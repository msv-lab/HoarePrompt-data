The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads an integer `S` and a list of integers `N`. It then processes the list `N` to find the second smallest unique integer if there are at least two unique integers. If there is only one unique integer or no unique integers, it returns the largest integer in the list `N` or the only unique integer plus one, respectively. The function prints the result for each test case. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
