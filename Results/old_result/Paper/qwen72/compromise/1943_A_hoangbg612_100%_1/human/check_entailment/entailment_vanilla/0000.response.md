### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and then deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The score of the game is the MEX of `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the score, and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - We need to find the final score if both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - If both players play optimally, the MEX of `c` will be the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times in `a` (since Alice can ensure it is included in `c`).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N` to facilitate the MEX calculation.
   - It initializes `cur` to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `M` to count the occurrences of each element in `N`.
   - It iterates through the sorted array `N`:
     - If the current element `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`.
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and updates the dictionary `M`.
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of the values in `M` equals `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If the length of `cnt` is at least 2, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

4. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if num > cur + 1` and the subsequent break statement do not correctly reflect the optimal play.
   - The final check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S` and the subsequent increment of `cur` is not necessary and does not align with the optimal strategy.
   - The logic for setting `cur` to the second element in `cnt` is also incorrect and does not reflect the optimal play.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach would involve:
     - Counting the occurrences of each element in `N`.
     - Finding the smallest integer that appears an odd number of times in `N` (since Alice can ensure it is included in `c`).
     - If no such integer exists, the MEX is 0.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both players and contains logical errors that prevent it from producing the correct MEX for the array `c`.
