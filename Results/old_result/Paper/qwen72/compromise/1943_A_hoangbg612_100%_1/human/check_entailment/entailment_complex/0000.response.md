### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N` itself.

2. **Sorting and Initialization**:
   - The array `N` is sorted, which is a good approach to handle the elements in a sequential manner.
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to -1, which will be used to track the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each element in `N`.

3. **Processing the Array**:
   - The loop iterates through each element `num` in the sorted array `N`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX has been found.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is equal to `cur`, it increments the frequency of `cur` in `M`.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the loop, it checks if the sum of frequencies in `M` is equal to `S`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1. This step is intended to handle the case where all elements are the same, but it seems to be an unnecessary check and could be misleading.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from `M` where the frequency is 1.
   - If `cnt` has at least two elements, it sets `cur` to the second smallest element in `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

### Issues:

1. **Unnecessary Sum Check**:
   - The check `if sum([M[k] for k in M.keys()]) == S:` is not necessary and can be misleading. The sum of frequencies should always be equal to `S` because every element in `N` is accounted for in `M`.

2. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX calculation logic is flawed. The MEX should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the array `c`. The current logic does not correctly handle the MEX calculation for all cases. For example, if `N` contains all unique elements from 0 to `S-1`, the MEX should be `S`, but the current logic might not return the correct value.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The optimal strategy for both players is not correctly implemented. Alice should always try to pick the smallest available element that is not in `c`, and Bob should try to pick the smallest available element that is in `c` or the next smallest available element that is not in `c` if the smallest element is not available.

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly implement the optimal strategy, we need to ensure that Alice and Bob are making the best possible moves to maximize and minimize the MEX, respectively. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()
        
        # Track the presence of each integer in the array
        present = [0] * S
        for num in N:
            if num < S:
                present[num] = 1
        
        # Find the MEX
        mex = 0
        for i in range(S):
            if present[i] == 0:
                break
            mex += 1
        
        # If the array has an even number of elements, Bob can always pick the next smallest element
        if S % 2 == 0:
            mex = min(mex, S // 2)
        else:
            mex = min(mex, S // 2 + 1)
        
        print(mex)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Implementation:

1. **Tracking Presence**:
   - We use a list `present` to track the presence of each integer from 0 to `S-1` in the array `N`.

2. **Finding MEX**:
   - We iterate through the `present` list to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `N`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If the array has an even number of elements, Bob can always pick the next smallest element, so the MEX is at most `S // 2`.
   - If the array has an odd number of elements, Bob can pick the next smallest element up to `S // 2 + 1`.

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed MEX calculation and the unnecessary sum check. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
