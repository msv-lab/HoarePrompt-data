Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's break down the logic and compare it with the optimal strategy for both players:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting and Initialization**:
   - The array `N` is sorted.
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to -1 to keep track of the current MEX.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count the occurrences of each number in `N`.

3. **Processing the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N`.
   - For each number `num` in `N`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur`.
   - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` by 1 and breaks the loop, as this means the MEX is found.
   - If `num` is exactly `cur + 1`, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets `M[cur]` to 1.
   - If `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - If the sum of the counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1. This step seems to be intended to handle the case where all elements are the same, but it is not clear why this is necessary.
   - It then collects all unique elements in `cnt` that have a count of 1.
   - If there are at least two unique elements, it sets `cur` to the second smallest unique element.
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

### Issues and Misalignments:
- **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
  - The program does not correctly calculate the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`, but the program seems to focus on the second smallest unique element in `N` rather than the MEX of `c`.
  - The logic for setting `cur` to the second smallest unique element is not aligned with the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob should be playing to maximize and minimize the MEX of `c`, respectively, not just focusing on the second smallest unique element in `N`.

- **Optimal Strategy**:
  - The optimal strategy for Alice and Bob is more complex than the current implementation. Alice should always try to pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob should try to pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
  - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob or the construction of `c` based on their optimal moves.

### Correct Approach:
- **Simulate the Game**:
  - Simulate the turns of Alice and Bob by maintaining a set of available numbers and a set of numbers in `c`.
  - Alice should always pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and Bob should do the same.
  - Continue this process until `a` is empty and then calculate the MEX of `c`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly simulate the game or calculate the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
