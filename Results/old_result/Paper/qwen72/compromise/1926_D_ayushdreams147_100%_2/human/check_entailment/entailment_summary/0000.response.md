Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to solve the problem by counting the number of unique integers in the list `a` and adjusting the count based on the presence of their bitwise complements. However, the logic implemented in `func_1` does not correctly address the problem requirements.

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Bitwise Complement Misuse**:
   - The program uses the bitwise complement `(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num` to check for the presence of the complement of each number. This is incorrect because the problem requires that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. The bitwise complement of a number does not ensure this condition.
   - For example, if `num` is `1`, its complement is `2147483646` (which is `11111111111111111111111111111110` in binary). The program incorrectly assumes that these two numbers can be in the same group, which is not true because they do not have all bits different.

2. **Grouping Logic**:
   - The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of groups required. It only counts the number of unique integers and their complements, which is not the same as ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits.
   - The correct approach would be to consider the 31 least significant bits of each number and determine the maximum number of unique bit patterns that appear in the list. This maximum number of unique bit patterns will be the minimum number of groups required.

### Correct Approach:
- For each number, extract the 31 least significant bits.
- Use a set to keep track of the unique bit patterns.
- The size of this set will be the minimum number of groups required.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    bit_patterns = set()
    for num in a:
        bit_pattern = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)  # Extract the 31 least significant bits
        bit_patterns.add(bit_pattern)
    return len(bit_patterns)
```

### Explanation:
- The `bit_pattern` for each number is obtained by performing a bitwise AND with `(1 << 31) - 1`, which effectively extracts the 31 least significant bits.
- The `bit_patterns` set keeps track of all unique bit patterns.
- The length of the `bit_patterns` set is the minimum number of groups required, as each unique bit pattern must be in a different group.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
