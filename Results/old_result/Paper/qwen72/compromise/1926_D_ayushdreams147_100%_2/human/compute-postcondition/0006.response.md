Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns the number of unique integers in the list `a` after processing the list to account for bitwise complements. Specifically, it counts the unique integers in `a` and adjusts the count based on the presence of their bitwise complements. The final state of the program is that `res` holds the number of unique integers in `a` that do not have a complete pair of their bitwise complements. **
