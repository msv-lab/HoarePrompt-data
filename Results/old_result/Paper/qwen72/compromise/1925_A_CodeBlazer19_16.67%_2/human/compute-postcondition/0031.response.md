The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 2, and `t` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is the string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, `j` is `k` + 96. If `k` is 1, `k` remains 1. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 1.**
