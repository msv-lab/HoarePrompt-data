The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `k` is 1, `s` is the string 'a' and `j` is 97. Otherwise, `s` is the string containing the first `k` letters of the alphabet starting from 'a' and `j` is `k` + 96, with `k` not equal to 1.**
