Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `s` is 'a', `j` starts at 97, `k` must be greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` (which starts at 97) to the string `s`. The ASCII value 97 corresponds to the character 'a'. Therefore, `s` is now 'a'. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and the condition that `k` must be greater than 1) remain unchanged.
