Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s` is the string containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the English alphabet, `j` is `k` + 96. If `k` is 1, `k` remains 1. Otherwise, `k` is greater than 1.***
