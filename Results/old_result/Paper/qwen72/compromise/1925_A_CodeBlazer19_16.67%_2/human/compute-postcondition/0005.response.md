Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 26 and 1 <= `k` <= 26, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the string 'a', `j` starts from 97.**

The code snippet `s += chr(j)` appends the character 'a' (since `j` starts from 97, and `chr(97)` is 'a') to the string `s`. Initially, `s` is an empty string, so after the execution, `s` becomes 'a'. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged.
