The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and the list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If `qs` has more elements, the loop will execute again with the next element in `qs`.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the first element in `qs`, and `qs` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute one more time, `qs` must have at least 2 elements, and `n` will be the second element in `qs`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q and must have at least 2 elements, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `n` is the second element in `qs`.**
