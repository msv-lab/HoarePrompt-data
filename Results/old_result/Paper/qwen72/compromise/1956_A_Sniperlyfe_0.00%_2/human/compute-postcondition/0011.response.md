To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
- `k` and `q` are input integers such that \(1 \leq k, q \leq 100\).
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers such that \(1 \leq qs[i] \leq 100\) for all \(0 \leq i < q\).
- `qs` has been updated to a list of integers from the user input.
- `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it, where `n` is the second element of `qs`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` is a list that contains the results of two calls to `func_1(n, p)`.
   - The first call to `func_1(n, p)` is stored in `res`.
   - The second call to `func_1(n, p)` is appended to `res`.
   - `n` is the second element of the list `qs`.

2. **Understanding `func_1(n, p)`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is not explicitly defined in the problem statement, so we can't determine its exact output. However, we know that it returns an integer value based on the input `n` and the list `p`.

3. **Constructing `res`**:
   - Let's denote the result of the first call to `func_1(n, p)` as `result1`.
   - Let's denote the result of the second call to `func_1(n, p)` as `result2`.
   - Therefore, `res` will be a list containing two elements: `[result1, result2]`.

4. **Printing `res`**:
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space.
   - The output will be a string where the two results are separated by a space.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `result1` and `result2` depend on the implementation of `func_1(n, p)`, we can only describe the output in terms of these results.

Output: **result1 result2 (where result1 and result2 are the results of the two calls to func_1(n, p), and n is the second element of the list qs)**
