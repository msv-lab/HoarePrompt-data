To determine what will be printed by the `print(' '.join(map(str, res)))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
   - `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that \(1 \leq k, q \leq 100\).
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers such that \(1 \leq qs[i] \leq 100\) for all \(0 \leq i < q\) and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
   - `n` is the second element in `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The `res` list is initially populated with the result of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - The loop continues to append the result of `func_1(n, p)` to `res` for each iteration.
   - The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 250.
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space, then prints the resulting string.

4. **Understanding `func_1(n, p)`:**
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is not defined in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact output. However, we know it returns an integer based on the inputs `n` and `p`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - Since `res` contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` for `t` iterations, the `print` statement will output a space-separated string of these results.
   - The exact values of these results depend on the implementation of `func_1(n, p)`, but we can describe the output in terms of the function's results.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output a space-separated string of `t` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

Output: **[result_1] [result_2] ... [result_t] (where each [result_i] is the result of `func_1(n, p)` for the i-th iteration, and `n` is the second element in the `qs` list)**
