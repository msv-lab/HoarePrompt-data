Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, and `qs` has been updated to a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs` in the order they appear in `qs`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `k`, `q`, and `p` remain unchanged. The list `qs` is still the same list of positive integers provided by the user. The list `res` now contains the results of the function `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, in the order that they appear in `qs`. Each result is appended to `res` during each iteration of the loop, and the final `res` list contains all these results.
