Let's break down the task step by step based on the initial state and the provided code snippet.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
2. `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
3. `k` and `q` are assigned integer values from the input.
4. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
5. `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements.
6. `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` twice, where `n` is the second element of `qs`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Input and Initialization:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 250.
   - `k` and `q` are integers provided by the user.
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 2 elements.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The variable `_` is incremented by `q` and the loop continues as long as `_` is less than `t`.

3. **Function Call:**
   - `n` is the second element of `qs`.
   - `func_1(n, p)` is called twice, and the results are stored in the list `res`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space, then prints the resulting string.

### Determining the Output:
- **`n`**: This is the second element of the list `qs`.
- **`func_1(n, p)`**: This function is called twice with the same arguments `n` and `p`. The exact output of `func_1` is not provided, so we can only describe it in terms of the function's behavior.
- **`res`**: This list will contain two elements, both of which are the result of `func_1(n, p)`.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the two results of `func_1(n, p)` separated by a space. Since the exact output of `func_1` is not specified, we can only describe it in terms of the function's behavior.

Output: **[result of func_1(n, p)] [result of func_1(n, p)] (where n is the second element of the list qs and p is the list of integers provided by the user)**
