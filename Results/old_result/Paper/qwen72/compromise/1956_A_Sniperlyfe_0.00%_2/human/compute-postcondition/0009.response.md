The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n` and the list `qs`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `qs`. If there are more elements in `qs`, the loop will execute again with the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` was the first element of `qs`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be the next element in the list `qs`. The list `qs` must have at least one more element for the loop to continue.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `k` and `q` are input integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of q positive integers such that 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q, and `qs` has been updated to a list of integers from the user input, `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, `n` is the second element of `qs`**
