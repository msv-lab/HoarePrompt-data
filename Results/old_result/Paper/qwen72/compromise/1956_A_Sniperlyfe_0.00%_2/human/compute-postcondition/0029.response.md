To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
   - `k` and `q` are updated to new input integers such that \(1 \leq k, q \leq 100\).
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers such that \(1 \leq qs[i] \leq 100\) for all \(0 \leq i < q\) and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.
   - `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.
   - `n` is the third element in `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The variable `res` is a list that contains the results of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)` appended to it.
   - `n` is the third element in the list `qs`.
   - The `print` statement converts each element of `res` to a string and joins them with a space, then prints the resulting string.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `n` is the third element in `qs`, and `qs` is a list of positive integers where \(1 \leq qs[i] \leq 100\), `n` will be one of these integers.
   - `func_1(n, p)` is a function that takes `n` and `p` as arguments and returns some result. The exact nature of `func_1` is not provided, so we can only describe the output in terms of the function's results.
   - `res` is a list that contains two elements: the result of `func_1(n, p)` and the new result of `func_1(n, p)`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the two results of `func_1(n, p)` separated by a space.

Output: **[result1] [result2] (where result1 and result2 are the results of func_1(n, p), and n is the third element in the list qs)**
