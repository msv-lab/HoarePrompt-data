Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 250, `_` is incremented by `q` and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `k` and `q` are assigned integer values from the input, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `qs` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`, and the loop has executed for all elements in `qs`.**

In natural language: After the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `_` has been incremented by `q` for each iteration, and it must still be less than `t` for the loop to have executed. The variables `k` and `q` retain their initial values assigned from the input. The list `p` remains unchanged. The list `qs` is the same as provided by the user, and the list `res` now contains the results of the function `func_1(n, p)` for each element `n` in `qs`. The loop has executed for all elements in `qs`, and the final state of `res` reflects the cumulative results of these function calls.
