To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 250\).
   - `k` and `q` are input integers such that \(1 \leq k, q \leq 100\).
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers such that \(1 \leq qs[i] \leq 100\) for all \(0 \leq i < q\).
   - `qs` has been updated to a list of integers from the user input.
   - `res` is a list containing the result of `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element of `qs`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The `print` statement will convert each element of the list `res` to a string and join them with a space.
   - The content of `res` is determined by the function `func_1(n, p)`, where `n` is the first element of the list `qs`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can only describe the output based on the information given:

- `n` is the first element of `qs`.
- `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)`, which is a list of integers.

Therefore, the `print` statement will output the elements of `res` as a space-separated string.

Output: **The space-separated string of the elements in `res` (where `res` is the result of `func_1(n, p)` and `n` is the first element of the list `qs`)**
