Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the function `func_2()`. Specifically, the `print` statement is inside the loop that processes each query, which means it will print the result after processing each query, rather than printing all results at once after processing all queries. This will result in incorrect output formatting.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2
2 1
3 5
5
1 3 5
1 4 6
```

The expected output is:
```
2
1 1 1
```

However, the program will produce:
```
2
1
1
1
```

This is because the `print` statement is inside the loop that processes each query, causing it to print the result of each query immediately rather than collecting all results and printing them at the end. To fix this, the `print` statement should be moved outside the loop that processes each query.
