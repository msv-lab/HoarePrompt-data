Reasoning:  
- The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for determining the number of players that remain after all rounds of the game. It repeatedly subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`. This matches the problem description, where players are removed based on the positions specified in `p` until no more players can be removed.
- The function `func_2` reads the input as specified in the problem description, processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the appropriate arguments, and prints the results. However, there is a minor issue in the `func_2` function: the `print` statement is inside the loop that processes each `n` in `qs`, which means it will print the results after each individual `n` is processed, rather than after all `n` values for a test case have been processed. This will result in incorrect output formatting, as the problem requires the results for each test case to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the output formatting issue in `func_2`.

Correctness: **False**
