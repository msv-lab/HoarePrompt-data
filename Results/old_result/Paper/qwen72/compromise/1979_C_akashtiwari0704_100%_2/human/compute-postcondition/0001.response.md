The only objects in the loop head are the variables `T` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is not defined, and `t` is an integer provided by the input where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `T` must be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
