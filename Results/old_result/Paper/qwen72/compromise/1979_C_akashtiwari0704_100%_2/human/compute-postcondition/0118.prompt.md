Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` does not take any input parameters. The number of test cases `t` is an integer provided by the input, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The initial state for each test case, with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers `k_1, k_2, ..., k_n` (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20), remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for T in range(t):

    def lcm(l):
        g = 1
        for i in range(len(l)):
            g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])
        return g
    bets = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    prod = lcm(a)
    sumo = 0
    for i in range(bets):
        a[i] = prod // a[i]
        sumo += int(a[i])
    if sumo >= prod:
        print(-1)
    else:
        ans = ''
        for i in range(bets):
            ans += str(a[i]) + ' '
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`, and `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `sumo` is less than `prod`, and `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T + bets`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the integers `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all integers in the list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`. `l` is a non-empty list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
