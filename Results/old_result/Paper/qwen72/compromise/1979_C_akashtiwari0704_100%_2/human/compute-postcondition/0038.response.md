Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `bets` is an input integer greater than 0.
2. `i` is `bets - 1`.
3. `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`.
4. `sumo` is increased by the sum of `prod // a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `bets - 1`.
5. `sumo` is less than `prod`.
6. `ans` is a string containing the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`bets`**: This is a positive integer. Let's denote it as `n`.
2. **`i`**: This is `bets - 1`, so `i = n - 1`.
3. **`a[j]`**: For each `j` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]`. This means each element in the list `a` is replaced by the integer division of `prod` by the original value of `a[j]`.
4. **`sumo`**: This is increased by the sum of the updated values of `a[j]` for all `j` in the range from 0 to `n - 1`. Since `sumo` is less than `prod`, it implies that the sum of the updated values of `a[j]` is less than `prod`.
5. **`ans`**: This is a string that contains the updated values of `a[0]` to `a[n - 1]`, each followed by a space.

### Determining the Output:
- The `print(ans)` statement will print the string `ans`.
- The string `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[n - 1]` after they have been updated to `prod // a[j]`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `prod` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the given conditions.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[0] // prod a[1] // prod ... a[n-1] // prod (where each value is the result of the integer division of `prod` by the original value of `a[j]` and `n` is the value of `bets`)**
