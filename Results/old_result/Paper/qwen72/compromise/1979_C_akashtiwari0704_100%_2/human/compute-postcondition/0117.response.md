Postcondition: ***`bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T + bets`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `sumo` is the sum of the integers `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`. If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space. Otherwise, `ans` is a string containing the space-separated string representations of all integers in the list `a` from `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]`. `l` is a non-empty list.***
