Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `bets - 1`, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T + bets`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `g` is 1, and `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space if `sumo` is less than `prod`, otherwise `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    g = g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `g` is updated to `g * l[0] // gcd(g, l[0])`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T + bets`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space if `sumo` is less than `prod`, otherwise `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `l` must be a non-empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `g` is updated to `g * l[1] // gcd(g, l[1])`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T + bets`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space if `sumo` is less than `prod`, otherwise `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `l` must be a non-empty list with at least one more element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `g` is updated to `g * l[2] // gcd(g, l[2])`, `sumo` is the sum of `int(prod // a[j])` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `bets` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `a[j]` is updated to `prod // a[j]` for all `j` from 0 to `bets - 1`, `T` is `T + bets`, `t` must be greater than `T + bets`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `prod` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the integers in the list `a`, `ans` is updated to include the string representation of each element in the list `a` followed by a space if `sumo` is less than `prod`, otherwise `ans` contains the values of `a[0]` to `a[bets - 1]` each followed by a space, `l` must be a non-empty list with at least 2 more elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
