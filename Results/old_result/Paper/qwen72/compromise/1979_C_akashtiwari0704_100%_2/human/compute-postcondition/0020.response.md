The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `bets`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `bets`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 1, and `bets` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`bets` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is updated to `prod // a[0]`, `sumo` is increased by `prod // a[0]`**
