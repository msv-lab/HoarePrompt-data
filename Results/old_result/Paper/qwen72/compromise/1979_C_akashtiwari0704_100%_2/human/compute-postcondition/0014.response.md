Output State: **`bets` is an input integer, `t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is the least common multiple (LCM) of all elements in the list `l`, `l` is a list that must have at least `len(l)` elements, `i` is `len(l) - 1`, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.**

The code snippet `a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings based on whitespace, and converts each string to an integer, storing the result in the list `a`. The values of `bets`, `t`, `T`, `g`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
