Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0, `g` is `l[0]` if `l[0]` is greater than 1, otherwise `g` is 1, `l` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `g * l[i] // gcd(g, l[i])`.
- Given that `g` is initially 1 and `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `1 * l[0] // gcd(1, l[0])`.
- Since the greatest common divisor (gcd) of 1 and any integer is 1, the expression further simplifies to `1 * l[0] // 1`, which is just `l[0]`.
- Therefore, `g` is now equal to `l[0]` if `l[0]` is greater than 1. If `l[0]` is 1, `g` remains 1.
- The values of `t`, `T`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged.
