You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of a_i is divisible by n, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():

                curr += i - last
        
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The value of `t` is reduced by the number of iterations that have been completed, and `n` and `nums` are updated based on the input provided during each iteration. The variables `last` and `curr` are used within each iteration and reset at the start of each new iteration. The final output for each iteration is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition `curr == 0`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the difference between the sum of the elements and the last element, adjusted for each non-zero element, is zero. This does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

A correct approach would involve checking if the average amount of water (which is the sum of all elements divided by the number of containers) can be achieved by pouring water from any container to any other container with a higher index. The program should verify if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers, and if so, ensure that the distribution can be achieved by the allowed operations.

Here is a case where the program fails:
```
Input:
1
3
1 2 3

Output (expected):
YES

Output (actual):
NO
```
In this case, the sum of the elements is 6, and the average is 2. By pouring 1 unit of water from the third container to the first, all containers will have 2 units of water, which should result in "YES". However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO".
