Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers by pouring water from a container with a higher index to a container with a lower index. The key insight is that if the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, it is always possible to equalize the water if and only if the water can be redistributed such that each container ends up with the same amount of water.

However, the provided program does not correctly implement this logic. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Use of `last`**: The program uses the last element of the list `nums` to compare with all other elements. This is incorrect because the last element is not necessarily the target amount of water each container should have. The target amount should be the average of all elements, which is `sum(nums) // n`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `curr`**: The program calculates `curr` by summing the differences between each non-zero element and the last element. This is not the correct way to determine if the water can be equalized. Instead, it should check if the water can be redistributed to make all elements equal to the average.

3. **Output Logic**: The program outputs 'YES' if `curr` is zero, which is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be whether the water can be redistributed to make all elements equal to the average.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

- Calculate the average amount of water each container should have.
- Check if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have this average amount.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Calculate the target amount of water each container should have
        target = sum(nums) // n
        
        # Check if the water can be redistributed to make all containers have the target amount
        if all(i <= target for i in nums):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

However, the provided program does not follow this logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
