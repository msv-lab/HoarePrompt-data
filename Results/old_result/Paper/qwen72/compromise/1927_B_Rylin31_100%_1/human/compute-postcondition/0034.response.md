Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` in the order they appear.**

Explanation:
- The code initializes `s` to be a list of length `l` where each element is 0.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `l`, `array`, and `ans` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The list `s` is now a list of zeros with length `l`.
