Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of length `t` containing all zeros except `s[j]` which is now 2, `array` must have at least three integers, `j` is the third integer in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` and then the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` was initially a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the same character.
- The code snippet `ans += chr(s[j] + 97)` appends the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` to `ans`.
- Since `s[j]` is 2, the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` is `99`, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.
- Therefore, `ans` now contains the character `'c'` three times.
- All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
