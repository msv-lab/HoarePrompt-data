Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then constructs a string `ans` by converting each element in `a` to a corresponding character based on the current state of a list `s` of length `n`, where the character is determined by the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `a`. The list `s` is updated by incrementing the value at the index `j` for each element `j` in `a`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the constructed string `ans` for each test case. The final state of the program includes the integer `t` (number of test cases), the integer `i` (which is `t-1`), the integer `l` (the last input integer `n`), the list `s` (where each element is 0 except for the elements at the indices specified by the elements in `array`, which are incremented by the number of times their index appears in `array`), the list `array` (the last input list of integers), and the string `ans` (the last constructed string). **
