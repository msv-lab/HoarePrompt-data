Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 1, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at index `j` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `j` is the second element of `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged.
- The value of `i` remains unchanged.
- The value of `l` remains unchanged.
- The list `s` remains unchanged.
- The list `array` remains unchanged.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged.
- The string `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` to itself. Since `s[j]` is 1, the character appended is `chr(1 + 97)`, which is `'b'`. Therefore, `ans` now contains the character `'b'` twice.
