The only variable in the loop head is `i`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the integer input provided. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 2 and the integer input provided must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the input integer, `s` is a list of length `l` where each element at the indices present in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`, and all other elements remain 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `s[j] + 97` for each element `j` in `array` in the order they appear, the integer input provided must be greater than 1**
