The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `array`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `array`. If `array` has at least one element, the loop can execute. The variable `j` will take the value of the first element in `array` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 2, `l` is the new input integer (which must be greater than 1), `s` is a list of length `l` where each element is 0, `array` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one element, `ans` is an empty string, `j` is the first element in `array`**
