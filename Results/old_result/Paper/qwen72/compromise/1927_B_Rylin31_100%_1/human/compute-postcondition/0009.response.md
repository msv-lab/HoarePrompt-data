Output State: **`t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), `i` is 0, `l` is equal to `t`, `s` is a list of length `t` containing all zeros except `s[j]` which is 1, `array` must have at least two integers, `j` is the second integer in `array`, `ans` is a string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` followed by the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- The value of `i` remains 0.
- The value of `l` remains equal to `t`.
- The list `s` remains a list of length `t` with all zeros except `s[j]` which is 1.
- The list `array` remains a list with at least two integers, and `j` is still the second integer in `array`.
- The string `ans` is updated by appending the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `s[j] + 97` to its existing value. Since `s[j]` is 1, the ASCII value is `1 + 97 = 98`, which corresponds to the character 'b'. Therefore, `ans` now contains the character 'b' twice.
