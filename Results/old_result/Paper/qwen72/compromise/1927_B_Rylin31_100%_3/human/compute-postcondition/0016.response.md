The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. The loop is controlled by the range of `i`, which is determined by the input provided at the start of the loop. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` has a value that is one less than the current iteration count. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the current value of `i`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is the current iteration count minus 1.
- The input value must be greater than the current value of `i` for the loop to continue.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1.
- The input value must be greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, for each test case, a valid string s exists, `l` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is a list of length `l` where the element at each index `j` in `array` is incremented by the number of times that index appears in `array`, and all other elements are 0; `array` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least one element; `ans` is a string containing the characters corresponding to `s[j] + 97` in the ASCII table for each element `j` in `array`, `i` is incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than the new value of `i`**.
