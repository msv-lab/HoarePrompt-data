You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        s = [0 for i in range(l)]
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ans = ''
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and a list of integers `array` from the input. It then constructs a string `ans` by mapping each integer in `array` to a character in the alphabet (starting from 'a') based on the current count in a list `s` of length `l`. After processing all integers in `array`, it prints the resulting string `ans`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string, `l`, and the trace array, `array`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array `s` will keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the resulting string.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program iterates over the trace array `array`.
   - For each element `j` in the trace array, it appends the character corresponding to `s[j]` to the result string `ans`.
   - The character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`, where `97` is the ASCII value of 'a'. This means that if `s[j]` is 0, the character 'a' is appended, if `s[j]` is 1, the character 'b' is appended, and so on.
   - After appending the character, it increments `s[j]` by 1 to update the count of occurrences for that character.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the string for each test case, it prints the result string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for constructing the string `ans` from the trace array `array` is sound. The trace array `a` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the character at each position, and the program uses this information to map each position to a unique character.
- The use of `chr(s[j] + 97)` ensures that the characters are from the lowercase Latin letters 'a' to 'z'.
- The program guarantees that the resulting string `ans` will be valid for the given trace array, as it always maps the trace values to a unique character and updates the count accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
