### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `t`, using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string, `l`, and the trace array, `array`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This array `s` will keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the resulting string.

3. **Constructing the String:**
   - The program iterates over the trace array `array`.
   - For each element `j` in the trace array, it appends the character corresponding to `s[j]` to the result string `ans`.
   - The character is determined by `chr(s[j] + 97)`, where `97` is the ASCII value of 'a'. This means that if `s[j]` is 0, the character 'a' is appended, if `s[j]` is 1, the character 'b' is appended, and so on.
   - After appending the character, it increments `s[j]` by 1 to update the count of occurrences for that character.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the string for each test case, it prints the result string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The logic for constructing the string `ans` from the trace array `array` is sound. The trace array `a` indicates the number of previous occurrences of the character at each position, and the program uses this information to map each position to a unique character.
- The use of `chr(s[j] + 97)` ensures that the characters are from the lowercase Latin letters 'a' to 'z'.
- The program guarantees that the resulting string `ans` will be valid for the given trace array, as it always maps the trace values to a unique character and updates the count accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
