### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - Additionally, the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of these integers should be maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(n, k)` to generate the sequence.
   - The sequence is stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `nums` is initialized as a list of `n` zeros.
   - **Setting the First Element:**
     - `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
     - This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.
   - **Distributing the Remaining Sum:**
     - The remaining sum `k` is reduced by the value of `nums[0]`.
     - For each subsequent element in the sequence, if `k` is still positive, the program sets `nums[i]` to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`.
     - This ensures that each subsequent number is as large as possible without exceeding the remaining sum.
   - **Adjusting the First Element:**
     - After distributing the remaining sum, any leftover is added back to `nums[0]` to ensure the total sum is exactly `k`.

4. **Verification:**
   - **Sum Condition:**
     - The sum of the elements in `nums` is indeed `k` because the remaining sum `k` is distributed among the elements and any leftover is added back to `nums[0]`.
   - **Maximizing the Number of 1s:**
     - The first element `nums[0]` is set to the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
     - The subsequent elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k`, which ensures that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.
     - The bitwise OR of the sequence will have the maximum number of 1s because the first element has the maximum number of 1s, and the subsequent elements are chosen to maximize the number of 1s in the OR operation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Single Element (n = 1):**
     - The program correctly sets `nums[0]` to `k` and returns it.
   - **Multiple Elements (n > 1):**
     - The program correctly distributes the sum `k` among the elements while ensuring the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
