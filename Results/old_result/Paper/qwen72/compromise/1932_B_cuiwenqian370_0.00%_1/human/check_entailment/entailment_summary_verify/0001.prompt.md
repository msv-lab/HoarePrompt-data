You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    dp = [0] * n
    if path[0] == '@':
        dp[0] = 1
    elif path[0] == '*':
        dp[0] = -float('inf')
    if n > 1:
        if path[1] == '*':
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
    return max((x for x in dp if x > -float('inf')))

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        path = data[index]
        index += 1
        results.append(func_1(path))
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases where `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, and each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path`. It applies `func_1` to each `path` and prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each test case. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur in a specific sequence.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to solve a different problem. It appears to be a dynamic programming solution for a path traversal problem where certain characters (`@` and `*`) have specific meanings.
   - The function `func_1` is not relevant to the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs. It is not designed to handle periodic occurrences of signs and sequential waiting.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of signs `n` for each test case.
   - However, it incorrectly treats the periodicities `a_i` as a single string `path` and passes it to `func_1`.
   - `func_1` is not designed to handle the periodicities of signs, so it will not produce the correct output for this problem.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the numbers in the set.
   - For each test case, we should compute the LCM of the periodicities and output that as the year when the n-th sign will occur.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not designed to find the year when the n-th sign occurs based on the periodicities of the signs.
