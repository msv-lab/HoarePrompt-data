You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: `path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0.
    dp = [0] * n

        #State: *`path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '*', or some other character (but not '@'), `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If the first element of `path` is '*', then the first element of `dp` is set to `-inf`.
    #State: *`path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to `-inf`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[0]` remains 0.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')
        else :
            dp[1] = dp[0] + (1 if path[1] == '@' else 0)
        #State: `path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 1; `dp` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to `-inf`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[0]` remains 0. If the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is set to `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then `dp[1]` is set to 1 if `path[1]` is '@' or 0 otherwise.
    #State: *`path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to `-inf`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[0]` remains 0. If `n` > 1, and the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is set to `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then `dp[1]` is set to 1 if `path[1]` is '@' or 0 otherwise. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged except for `dp[0]` as described above.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':
            dp[i] = -float('inf')
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]) + (1 if path[i] == '@' else 0)
        
    #State: `path` remains a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of length `n` where `dp[i]` is set to `-inf` if `path[i]` is '*', otherwise `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1 if `path[i]` is '@' or 0 otherwise.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated based on the conditions: if `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`; if `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1; otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1] and `dp[i-2]` plus 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `path`, a non-empty list of strings. It returns 0 if all elements in `path` are '*' or if any condition that leads to a return of 0 is met. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity, calculated based on the rules: if `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`; if `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1; otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated based on the conditions: if `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`; if `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1; otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1] and `dp[i-2]` plus 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
