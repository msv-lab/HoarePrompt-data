The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `t` and `data`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `data` is a list of strings containing the input data for `t` test cases. The function processes each test case in the `data` list and returns a list of results corresponding to each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `data`, where `t` is the number of test cases and `1 <= t <= 1000`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case in `data`.**
