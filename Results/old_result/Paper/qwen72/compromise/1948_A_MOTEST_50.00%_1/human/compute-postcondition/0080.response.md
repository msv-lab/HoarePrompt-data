Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 5, `ans` is the string `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice and then `s[2]` repeated twice, `x` is 2, `j` is 2**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += s[x] * 2` appends the character at index `x` of the string `s` repeated twice to the existing value of `ans`. Since `x` is 2, the character at index 2 of `s` is appended twice to `ans`. The initial value of `ans` was `s[0]` repeated twice followed by `s[1]` repeated twice, so after the code execution, `ans` becomes `s[0]` repeated twice, `s[1]` repeated twice, and `s[2]` repeated twice. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `x`, and `j` remain unchanged.
