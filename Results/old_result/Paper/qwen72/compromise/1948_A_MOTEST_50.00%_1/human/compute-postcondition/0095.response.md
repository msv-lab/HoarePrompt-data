Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `x` is `n // 2`. If `n` is even, `ans` is the string formed by concatenating each of the first `n // 2` characters of `s` repeated twice, and `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd, `ans` is 'AAA' + `s[1]` * 2 + `s[2]` * 2 + ... + `s[(n // 2 - 1)]` * 2, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.***
