The function `func` accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function also accepts a single integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the input `n` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a single integer `n`. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to the input `n` for each test case.**
