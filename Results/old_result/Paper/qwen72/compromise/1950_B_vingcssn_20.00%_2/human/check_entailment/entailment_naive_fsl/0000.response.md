Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases for the input range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. It only explicitly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. For any other value of n within the specified range, it prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to output a checkerboard for any valid n. For example, if n = 5, the program will not generate the expected 10x10 checkerboard.
