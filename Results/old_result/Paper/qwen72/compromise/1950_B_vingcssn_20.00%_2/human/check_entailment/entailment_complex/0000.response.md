Reasoning:  
The program is designed to generate a checkerboard pattern based on the input integer `n`, which represents the side length of the checkerboard as `2n x 2n`. The program correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Limited Range Handling**: The program only explicitly handles `n` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4. For any `n` outside this range, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. This is incorrect because the problem statement specifies that `n` can be any integer between 1 and 20, inclusive. The program should generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid `n` within this range, not just for 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Generalization**: The program does not generalize the checkerboard pattern generation. Instead, it uses hard-coded patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4`. This approach is not scalable and does not meet the requirements for `n` values greater than 4.

3. **Output Format**: The program correctly prints the checkerboard patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` without spaces and in the correct format. However, it fails to handle other valid `n` values as required by the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem as described. It needs to be modified to handle any `n` value between 1 and 20, and to generate the checkerboard pattern in a generalized manner.

Correctness: **False**
