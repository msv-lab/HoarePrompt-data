The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following `t` lines contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the size of the checkerboard to be generated. The function returns the generated checkerboard for each test case.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of test cases `t` and the size `n` of the checkerboard for each test case from stdin. It returns the generated checkerboard for each test case.**
