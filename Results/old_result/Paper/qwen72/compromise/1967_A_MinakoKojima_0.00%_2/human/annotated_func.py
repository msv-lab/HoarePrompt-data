#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of distinct types of cards and the number of coins, respectively. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        m = min(a)
        
        ans = 0
        
        if k >= n * m:
            ans = math.factorial(n)
        else:
            k -= n * m
            for i in range(n):
                a[i] = m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
                k -= min(k, m + k // n - a[i])
            ans = a[0]
            for i in range(1, n):
                ans *= a[i] - a[i - 1]

    #State: `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, and `ans` is the result of the computation for each test case. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, then `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - sum(min(k, m + k // n - a[i]) for i in range(n))`, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` for `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, and `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a` for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`. The loop has executed `t` times, and `_` is equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates a result `ans` based on the following logic: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m` (where `m` is the minimum value in `a`), `ans` is set to `math.factorial(n)`. Otherwise, `k` is adjusted, and each element in `a` is updated such that the final `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of the updated list `a`. The function prints the result `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are no longer relevant to the final state of the program.
