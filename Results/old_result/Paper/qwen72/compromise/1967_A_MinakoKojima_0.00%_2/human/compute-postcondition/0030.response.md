Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again.** 

The values of `n` and `k` are now integers provided by the user input, while the other variables remain unchanged.
