Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, and `k` is `k - n * m`.**

The value of `k` is updated to `k - n * m`, where `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user input and `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `k` is less than `n * m` is still valid, so the new value of `k` will be less than 0.
