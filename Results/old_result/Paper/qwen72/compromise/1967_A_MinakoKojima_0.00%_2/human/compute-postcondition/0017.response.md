Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `i` is 2, `a[0]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[0])`, `a[1]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[1])`, `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.
- The value of `a[2]` is updated to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[2])`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
