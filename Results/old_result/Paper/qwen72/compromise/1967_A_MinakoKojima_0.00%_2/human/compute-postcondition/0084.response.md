The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is expected to process multiple test cases, each with the following inputs:
- `t`: an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case:
  - `n`: an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of distinct types of cards.
  - `k`: an integer where 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, representing the number of coins.
  - `a`: a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i.

The function returns the result of processing each test case. The exact return value for each test case is not specified, but it is implied that the function will return a result based on the inputs `n`, `k`, and `a` for each of the `t` test cases.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins `k`, and a list of integers `a` representing the number of cards of each type. It returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.**
