Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the user input, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`, `ans` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `t` for the loop to execute again, `k` is now `k - n * m`.**

The value of `k` is updated to `k - n * m`, where `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
