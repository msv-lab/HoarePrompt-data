The function `func_14` accepts four parameters: `a`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers, `n` and `m` are positive integers, and `k` is an integer. The length of `a` is equal to `n`. The function returns 1 in some cases and -1 in others, based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, positive integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. If the length of `a` is equal to `n`, the function returns 1 in one set of conditions and -1 in another set of conditions.**
