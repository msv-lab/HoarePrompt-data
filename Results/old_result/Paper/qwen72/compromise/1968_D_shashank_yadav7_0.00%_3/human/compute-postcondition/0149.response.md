To determine what will be printed by the `print('Sasha')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

### Initial State:
1. `n` is the first input integer.
2. `i` is `n - 1`.
3. `k` is the second input integer minus `n`.
4. `b` is the value of `p` indexed by the result of `p[p[b] - 1] - 1` after `n` iterations.
5. `s` is the value of `p` indexed by the result of `p[p[s] - 1] - 1` after `n` iterations.
6. `bm` is the initial value of `a[b] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
7. `sm` is the initial value of `a[s] * k` plus the sum of the maximum values between `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
8. `sp` is the initial value of `a[s]` plus the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
9. `bp` is the initial value of `a[b]` plus the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration.
10. If `k` is 0 at any point, the loop breaks and the final state reflects the values at that point.
11. `bm` is less than `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Sasha')
```

### Analysis:
The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'Sasha'`. The initial state and the variables described in the precondition do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the statement does not reference any of those variables or objects.

### Output:
Output: **Sasha**
