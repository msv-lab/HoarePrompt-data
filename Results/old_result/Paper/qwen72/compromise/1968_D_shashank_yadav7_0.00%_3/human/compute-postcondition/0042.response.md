Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is `n - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `k` is `k - n`, `b` is the result of `n` applications of the function `p[b] - 1`, `s` is the result of `n` applications of the function `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[s] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[s]`, `bp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[b] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[b]`, `bm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `bm` and `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `sm` and `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` for each iteration. If `k` reaches 0, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop runs `n` times, so `i` will be `n - 1` after all iterations.
- `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so after `n` iterations, `k` will be `k - n`.
- `b` and `s` are updated by applying the function `p[x] - 1` `n` times, starting from their initial values.
- `sp` is the sum of the values at the indices `p[s] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial value of `a[s]`.
- `bp` is the sum of the values at the indices `p[b] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial value of `a[b]`.
- `bm` is updated by adding the maximum value between its current value and `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is updated by adding the maximum value between its current value and `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` for each iteration.
- If `k` reaches 0 during the loop, `bm` and `sm` are set to 0, and the loop breaks.
