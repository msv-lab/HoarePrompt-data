The value of `k` is decreased by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. If `k` was 1 before the execution, it is now 0, and the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` was greater than 1, it is now `k - 1`, and the program continues.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, then further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`, `sm` is further updated to the maximum of its new value and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is not 0 and the program continues.**
