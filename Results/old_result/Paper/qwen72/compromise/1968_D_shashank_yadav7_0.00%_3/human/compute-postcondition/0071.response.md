Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is assigned the value `p[b] - 1`, `s` is assigned the value `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is not 0 and the program continues.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sp` is updated to `sp + a[s]`.
- All other conditions and variable values remain unchanged from the initial state.
