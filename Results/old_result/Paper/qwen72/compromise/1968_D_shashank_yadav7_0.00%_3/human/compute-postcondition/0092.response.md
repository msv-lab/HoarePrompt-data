Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `k` is decreased by 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `bm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, then further increased by the maximum of its new value and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of its previous value and `a[s] * k + sp`, `sm` is further updated to `sm + max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, `sp` is `sp + a[s]`, `bp` is `bp + a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bp` is updated to `bp + a[b]`.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, and `sp` remain as described in the initial state, with `bp` being the only variable that has changed.
- The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement remains the same: if `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
