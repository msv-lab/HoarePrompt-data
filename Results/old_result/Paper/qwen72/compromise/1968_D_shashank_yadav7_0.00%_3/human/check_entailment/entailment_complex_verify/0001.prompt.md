You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The loop has completed all `t` iterations. `i` is `t - 1`. `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` are the final values after the last iteration. `p` and `a` remain unchanged. `sp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[s] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[s]`. `bp` is the sum of the integers at the indices `p[b] - 1` after each iteration, plus the initial `a[b]`. `bm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `bm` and `a[b] * (k - i) + bp` for each iteration. `sm` is the sum of the maximum values between the initial `sm` and `a[s] * (k - i) + sp` for each iteration. If `k` reaches 0 before the loop completes, the loop breaks and the final state is determined at that point. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, then `bm` is greater than `sm`. Otherwise, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` representing the length of a permutation, the duration of a game, and the starting positions of two players, Bodya and Sasha, respectively. It also reads a permutation `p` of length `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. The function then simulates a game where Bodya and Sasha move according to the permutation `p` and the array `a` for `k` steps. After the simulation, it compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is higher, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is higher, or 'Draw' if their scores are equal. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices.

2. **Initial Scores:**
   - The initial scores for Bodya (`bp`) and Sasha (`sp`) are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

3. **Score Calculation Loop:**
   - The loop runs for `k` turns, but it incorrectly decrements `k` inside the loop, which can lead to incorrect behavior.
   - For each turn, the current positions `b` and `s` are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively. This is incorrect because the permutation `p` is 1-based, so subtracting 1 should be done only once when the positions are initialized.
   - The scores `bm` and `sm` are updated by adding the maximum of the current score and a calculated value. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the game rules. The score should simply be incremented by the value at the current position in `a`.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the final scores `bm` and `sm` are compared to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, Bodya wins.
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, Sasha wins.
   - If `bm` is equal to `sm`, it's a draw.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Position Update:**
  - The positions `b` and `s` are updated using `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1`, which is incorrect. The permutation `p` is 1-based, so the correct update should be `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` only once when initializing the positions.
- **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation logic inside the loop is flawed. The scores should be incremented by the value at the current position in `a` for each turn, not by a complex maximum calculation.
- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop terminates when `k` reaches 0, but the decrement of `k` should be done at the end of each iteration, not inside the loop.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index
        s -= 1  # Convert to 0-based index

        # Initialize scores
        bp = a[b]
        sp = a[s]

        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation
            s = p[s] - 1  # Move to the next position in the permutation
            bp += a[b]  # Add the score at the new position
            sp += a[s]  # Add the score at the new position

        # Determine the winner
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the corrected program is used.
- **False** if the original program is used.
