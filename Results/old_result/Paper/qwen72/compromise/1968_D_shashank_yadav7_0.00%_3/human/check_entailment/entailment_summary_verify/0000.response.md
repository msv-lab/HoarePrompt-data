Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed contains a logical error in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The lines:

```python
bm += max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
sm += max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
```

do not follow the rules of the game as described. According to the problem, each player's score should increase by the value at their current position in the array `a` on each turn, and then they can either stay or move to the position specified by the permutation `p`. The program incorrectly adds a maximum value that is a mix of the current score and the value at the new position, which does not align with the game rules.

The corrected version of the function, as suggested in the original assessment, correctly updates the scores based on the current position and then moves to the next position according to the permutation. This corrected version adheres to the problem description and should produce the correct results.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the given program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
