Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order by cyclically shifting substrings. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The function `func_1` processes each binary string `s`:
   - It initializes `n` to 0, which will count the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will accumulate the cost of the operations.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s`:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n` by 1.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0 (meaning there are '1's before this '0'), it adds `n + 1` to `ans`. This is because to move a '0' that is preceded by '1's to the correct position, you need to cyclically shift the substring starting from the first '1' to this '0', and the cost of this operation is the length of the substring, which is `n + 1`.

3. **Output**: After processing the string, `func_1` prints the accumulated cost `ans`.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then calling `func_1` for each test case.

The logic of the program is correct because:
- It correctly identifies the positions where a '0' is preceded by '1's, which are the points where a cyclic shift is needed.
- It calculates the cost of each shift correctly as `n + 1`.
- It accumulates the total cost correctly and prints it for each test case.

However, there is a potential issue with the program:
- The program does not handle the case where the string is already sorted (all '0's before all '1's). In such cases, the cost should be 0, but the current logic might not correctly handle this scenario.

To address this, we need to ensure that the program correctly outputs 0 for already sorted strings. The current logic should work for this because if there are no '0's preceded by '1's, `ans` will remain 0, which is the correct output.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
