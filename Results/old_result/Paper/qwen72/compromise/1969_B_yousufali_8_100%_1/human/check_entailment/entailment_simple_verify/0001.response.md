### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires sorting a binary string in non-descending order using the minimum total cost of cyclic shifts.
   - Each cyclic shift on a substring \( s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r \) has a cost of \( r - l + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - **Function 1**:
     - The function reads a binary string `s` from the input.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered.
     - It initializes `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character of the string `s`.
       - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2**:
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - It iterates `t` times, each time calling `func_1` to process a new binary string.
     - This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

3. **Correctness of Function 1**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of '1's (`n`) and calculates the cost of shifting '0's past '1's.
   - The cost calculation `n + 1` is correct because it accounts for the length of the substring being shifted, which includes the '0' and all the '1's before it.
   - The function prints the total cost for a single test case.

4. **Correctness of Function 2**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, each time calling `func_1` to process a new binary string.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly outputs 0.
   - If the string has no '0's or no '1's, the function correctly handles these cases by not adding any cost.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The time complexity is \( O(|s|) \) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The space complexity is \( O(1) \) for each test case, as it only uses a few variables.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Function 1**:
  - The function correctly processes the binary string `s`.
  - The logic for counting '1's and calculating the cost when encountering '0's is sound.
  - The cost calculation `n + 1` is correct because it accounts for the entire substring being shifted, including the '0' and all preceding '1's.
  - The function prints the total cost, which is the correct output for a single test case.

- **Function 2**:
  - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - It iterates `t` times, each time reading a new binary string and calling `func_1` to process it.
  - This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently, maintaining the correct state for each iteration.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles the input and output format correctly and efficiently computes the minimum total cost for sorting the binary string. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
