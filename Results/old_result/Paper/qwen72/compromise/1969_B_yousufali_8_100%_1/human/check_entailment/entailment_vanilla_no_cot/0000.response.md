Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` which does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. The function `func_1` incorrectly adds `n + 1` to `ans` whenever it encounters a '0' after a sequence of '1's, which does not align with the problem's requirement of cyclically shifting substrings to achieve a sorted string.

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to consider the following:
1. The goal is to move all '1's to the right of all '0's.
2. The cost of a cyclic shift of a substring is the length of that substring.
3. The optimal strategy involves finding the minimum number of operations to group all '1's together.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve:
1. Counting the total number of '1's in the string.
2. Sliding a window of size equal to the number of '1's across the string to find the minimum number of '1's that need to be moved to achieve a sorted string.
3. The minimum cost would be the total number of '1's minus the maximum number of '1's found in any window of size equal to the number of '1's.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_cost_to_sort(s):
    n = len(s)
    ones = s.count('1')
    max_ones_in_window = 0
    current_ones = 0
    
    # Sliding window to find the maximum number of '1's in a window of size 'ones'
    for i in range(n + ones):
        if s[i % n] == '1':
            current_ones += 1
        if i >= ones:
            if s[(i - ones) % n] == '1':
                current_ones -= 1
        max_ones_in_window = max(max_ones_in_window, current_ones)
    
    # The minimum cost is the total number of '1's minus the maximum number of '1's in any window
    return ones - max_ones_in_window

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        print(min_cost_to_sort(s))

# Example usage:
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Counting '1's**: `ones = s.count('1')` counts the total number of '1's in the string.
2. **Sliding Window**: The loop `for i in range(n + ones)` simulates the sliding window. The window size is `ones`, and it wraps around the string using modulo operation.
3. **Updating Current '1's**: `current_ones` keeps track of the number of '1's in the current window.
4. **Finding Maximum '1's in Window**: `max_ones_in_window` is updated to the maximum number of '1's found in any window of size `ones`.
5. **Calculating Minimum Cost**: The minimum cost is calculated as `ones - max_ones_in_window`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.
