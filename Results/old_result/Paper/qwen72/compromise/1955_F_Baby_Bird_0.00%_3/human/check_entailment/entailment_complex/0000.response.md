### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly processes the input for multiple test cases by iterating `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers from the input and stores them in the list `p`.

2. **Transformation of Input:**
   - The line `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` is crucial. It transforms each integer in the input list `p` by subtracting the remainder when divided by 2. This effectively converts all odd numbers to the nearest even number and keeps even numbers unchanged.
   - For example, if `p` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, after this transformation, `p` becomes `[0, 2, 2, 4]`.

3. **Winning Condition Calculation:**
   - The function then calculates the number of times Bob can win.
   - The expression `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if the first three elements of `p` (after transformation) are all odd. Since all elements are even after transformation, this condition will always be `False`.
   - The expression `sum(p) // 2` calculates the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2. This is the core of the logic, as it determines the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the sum of the two conditions mentioned above. Since the first condition is always `False`, the output is simply `sum(p) // 2`.

5. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins is to remove numbers in such a way that the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible. This is achieved by removing pairs of numbers, which is why the function uses `sum(p) // 2`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all numbers are even, the sum of `p` will be even, and the integer division will give the correct number of times Bob can win.
   - If there are odd numbers, they are converted to even numbers, and the function still calculates the correct number of wins for Bob.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The transformation and the calculation of the integer division are appropriate for the problem description.
