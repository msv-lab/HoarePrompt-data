The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. This impacts the variable `n` which now holds a specific value based on the input. The value of `n` should be within the range 2 to 50 as per the initial state conditions. The other parts of the initial state, such as the number of test cases `t` and the list of integers for each test case, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, read from the input. Each test case consists of a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).**
