Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 3, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` remains True unless `arr` is not sorted, in which case `ans` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first digit of `arr[i - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` creates a new list `nums` where the first part `[int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])]` converts the integer `arr[i - 1]` into a list of its digits, and the second part `[arr[i]]` appends the integer `arr[i]` to this list.
- The variable `arr[i - 1]` is then updated to the first element of the `nums` list, which is the first digit of the integer `arr[i - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged or retain their conditions as specified in the initial state.
