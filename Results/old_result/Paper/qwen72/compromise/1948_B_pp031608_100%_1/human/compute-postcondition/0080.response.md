Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 0 < n <= 49, `_` is incremented by 1, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` remains True. `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`. `arr[i - 1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet creates a list `nums` which contains the digits of `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`.
- The value of `arr[i - 1]` is updated to the first element of `nums`, which is the first digit of `arr[i - 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `_`, `m`, `arr`, `i`, and `ans`) remain unchanged or retain their initial conditions.
