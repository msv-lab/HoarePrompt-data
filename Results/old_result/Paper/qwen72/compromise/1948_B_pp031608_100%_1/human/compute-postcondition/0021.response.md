To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop head:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The loop iterates from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive).

2. **Current State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
   - `_` is a throwaway variable.
   - `m` is an integer such that m >= 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers read from the input.
   - `i` is `m - 2`.
   - `ans` remains True unless `arr` is not sorted, in which case `ans` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.

3. **Adjusting the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `m - 2`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` should be `m - 3`.

4. **Conditions for the Loop to Continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `m - 3` and `m - 3 > 0`, which implies `m > 3`.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is `m - 3`.
- `m` must be greater than 3 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `_` is a throwaway variable, `m` is an integer such that m >= 3, `arr` is a list of integers read from the input, `i` is `m - 3`, `ans` remains True unless `arr` is not sorted, in which case `ans` becomes False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, `nums` is a list containing the digits of the integer `arr[i - 1]` followed by the integer `arr[i]`, and `arr[i - 1]` is updated to `nums[0]`.**
