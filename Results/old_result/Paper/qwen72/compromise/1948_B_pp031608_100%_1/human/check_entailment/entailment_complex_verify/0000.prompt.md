You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is 0, `_` has been incremented by `n` times (where `n` is the initial value of `n`), `m` is the last input integer read, `arr` is the last list of integers read from the input, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met for each test case. If any test case encountered a condition where `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, `ans` is set to False for that test case. Otherwise, `ans` remains True for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case starts with an integer `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. If it can, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it handles the transformation and checking of the array. Specifically, the program only checks and modifies the array in a limited way, which may not cover all necessary transformations to ensure the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will process this as follows:
- It starts from the end of the array and checks if `67` is less than `45`. Since it is not, it moves to the next pair.
- It then checks if `45` is less than `3`. Since it is not, it moves to the next pair.
- Finally, it checks if `3` is less than `12`. Since it is, it attempts to split `12` into `[1, 2]` and adds `3` to the list, resulting in `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`.

However, the program does not correctly handle the transformation of `45` and `67` to check if the array can be sorted. The correct transformation would involve splitting `45` into `[4, 5]` and `67` into `[6, 7]`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted.

Thus, the program fails to correctly determine that the array can be sorted by the allowed operations, leading to an incorrect output of `NO` instead of `YES`.

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
