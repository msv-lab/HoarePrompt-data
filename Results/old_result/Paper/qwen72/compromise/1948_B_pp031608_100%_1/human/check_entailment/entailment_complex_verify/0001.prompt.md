You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 99).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is 0, `_` has been incremented by `n` times (where `n` is the initial value of `n`), `m` is the last input integer read, `arr` is the last list of integers read from the input, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the conditions inside the loop were met for each test case. If any test case encountered a condition where `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list was not sorted, `ans` is set to False for that test case. Otherwise, `ans` remains True for that test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case starts with an integer `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers. For each test case, the function checks if the list can be made non-decreasing by modifying at most one element. If it can, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `n`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Initial Assumption**: The function assumes that the array can be sorted (`ans = True`).

3. **Backward Iteration**: The function iterates through the array from the last element to the second element (`for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1)`).

4. **Condition Check**: For each pair of adjacent elements `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, it checks if `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`. If so, it means the array is not sorted at this point.

5. **Digit Splitting**: If the condition is met, it splits the element `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. It then checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Update Array**: If the digits are sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` to the first digit of the split list.

7. **Output**: After processing all elements, it prints `YES` if `ans` is still `True`, otherwise `NO`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Logic**:
  - The logic correctly identifies when the array cannot be sorted by splitting elements into their digits.
  - The backward iteration ensures that the function checks the most significant elements first, which is necessary for ensuring the array can be sorted.
  - The digit splitting and sorting check are performed correctly.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles edge cases such as arrays that are already sorted or contain only single-digit numbers.
  - It also handles cases where the array cannot be sorted by splitting elements.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The function has a time complexity of \(O(n \times d)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(d\) is the maximum number of digits in any element. This is efficient enough given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and handles all the specified cases correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
