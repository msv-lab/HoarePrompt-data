### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Case Handling**:
   - **Case 1: \( k = n \)**:
     - If \( k = n \), the program generates an array of `n` elements, all set to 1. This is correct because if all elements are the same, every cyclic shift of the array will be sorted.
   - **Case 2: \( k = 1 \)**:
     - If \( k = 1 \), the program generates an array of `n` elements where each element is a distinct integer from 0 to `n-1`. This is correct because only the original array will be sorted, and all other cyclic shifts will have at least one pair of elements that are out of order.
   - **Case 3: \( k \neq n \) and \( k \neq 1 \)**:
     - The program outputs `-1` for these cases. This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for other values of `k` that satisfy the problem's conditions. For example, if \( k = 2 \), a valid array could be `[1, 2, 1]` for \( n = 3 \). The program fails to generate such arrays.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the result for each test case. However, the logic for handling \( k \neq n \) and \( k \neq 1 \) is flawed, as it only outputs `-1` without considering other possible valid arrays.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where \( k \) is neither `n` nor `1`. It should be able to generate valid arrays for these cases as well.

### Correctness:
Final: **False**
