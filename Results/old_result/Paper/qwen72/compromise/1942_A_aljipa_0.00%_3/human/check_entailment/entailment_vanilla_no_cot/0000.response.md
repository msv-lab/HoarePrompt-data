Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here's the analysis:

1. **Case \( k = n \)**:
   - The program correctly outputs an array of all 1s, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of an array with all equal elements are sorted.

2. **Case \( k = 1 \)**:
   - The program outputs a range of numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \). This is not a valid solution because the range of numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \) is not guaranteed to produce exactly one sorted cyclic shift. For example, for \( n = 3 \), the array \([0, 1, 2]\) has three sorted cyclic shifts: \([0, 1, 2]\), \([1, 2, 0]\), and \([2, 0, 1]\). The correct approach should be to create an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted, such as \([1, 2, 10^9]\).

3. **Case \( k \neq 1 \) and \( k \neq n \)**:
   - The program outputs \(-1\) for any other value of \( k \). This is incorrect because there can be valid arrays for other values of \( k \). For example, for \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 2 \), a valid array could be \([1, 2, 3, 1]\), which has exactly two sorted cyclic shifts: \([1, 2, 3, 1]\) and \([1, 1, 2, 3]\).

To correctly solve the problem, the program should generate an array that meets the specified conditions for any valid \( k \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k > n:
            print(-1)
        elif k == n:
            print(*([1] * n))
        elif k == 1:
            print(*([1] + [2] * (n - 2) + [10**9]))
        else:
            print(*([1] * (n - k + 1) + [2] * (k - 1)))

func()
```

Explanation:
- **Case \( k > n \)**: This is an invalid input, so we output \(-1\).
- **Case \( k = n \)**: Output an array of all 1s.
- **Case \( k = 1 \)**: Output an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted, such as \([1, 2, 2, \ldots, 2, 10^9]\).
- **Case \( 1 < k < n \)**: Output an array where exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted, such as \([1, 1, 1, \ldots, 1, 2, 2, \ldots, 2]\) with \( n - k + 1 \) ones followed by \( k - 1 \) twos. This ensures that the array has exactly \( k \) sorted cyclic shifts.
