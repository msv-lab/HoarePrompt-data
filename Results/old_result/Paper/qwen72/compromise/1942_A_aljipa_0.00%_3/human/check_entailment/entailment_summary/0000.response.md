Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Case `k == n`**:
   - If `k` equals `n`, the function prints an array of `n` ones. This is correct because an array of identical elements will have all its cyclic shifts sorted. Therefore, there are exactly `n` sorted cyclic shifts, which matches the requirement `k == n`.

3. **Case `k == 1`**:
   - If `k` equals 1, the function prints the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`. This is correct because the array `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` is sorted, and only the first cyclic shift (the array itself) will be sorted. All other cyclic shifts will have a smaller number at the end, making them unsorted. Therefore, there is exactly 1 sorted cyclic shift, which matches the requirement `k == 1`.

4. **Case `k != 1 and k != n`**:
   - If `k` is neither `n` nor 1, the function prints `-1`. This is incorrect. The problem does not state that no solution exists for `k` values other than 1 or `n`. In fact, there can be valid arrays for other values of `k`. For example, if `n = 4` and `k = 2`, a valid array could be `[1, 1, 2, 2]`, which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 1, 2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 1, 1]`.

Therefore, the function is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `k` is neither 1 nor `n` properly. It should attempt to construct a valid array for these cases instead of always printing `-1`.

Correctness: **False**
