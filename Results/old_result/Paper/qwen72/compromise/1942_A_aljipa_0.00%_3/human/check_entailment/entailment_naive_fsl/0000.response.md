Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. Specifically, it fails to generate a valid array for cases where \(1 < k < n\).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 2
```
The program will output:
```
-1
```
However, a valid array for this input could be:
```
1 2 2 1
```
The cyclic shifts of this array are:
- \(x = 1\): [1, 2, 2, 1] (sorted)
- \(x = 2\): [2, 2, 1, 1] (sorted)
- \(x = 3\): [2, 1, 1, 2] (not sorted)
- \(x = 4\): [1, 1, 2, 2] (sorted)

But only two of these shifts are sorted, which matches the requirement \(k = 2\). Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly.
