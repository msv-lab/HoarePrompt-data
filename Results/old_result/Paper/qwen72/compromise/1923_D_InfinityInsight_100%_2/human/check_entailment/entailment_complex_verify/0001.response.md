### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a line of `n` slimes, each with a size `a_i`.
   - Each second, a slime can eat one of its neighbors if it is strictly larger than the neighbor.
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten, or report `-1` if it is impossible.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `x`.
     - It returns the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`, or `-1` if no such element exists.
     - The function uses `bisect_left` to find the index efficiently.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `n` (the number of slimes).
     - It initializes two lists: `left` and `last`.
     - `left` is a prefix sum array of the sizes of the slimes.
     - `last` keeps track of the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one.
     - `ans` is the result array initialized to `-1` for all slimes.
     - The function iterates through the slimes from left to right:
       - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, it means the slime `i` can be eaten by `a[i-1]` in the next second, so `ans[i]` is set to `1`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates the total size of slimes to the left of `i` (excluding `i` itself) and subtracts `a[i]` and `1` to get `x`.
       - It then uses `func_1` to find the index of the first slime to the left of `i` whose prefix sum is greater than or equal to `x`.
       - It also checks if the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one (`last[i-1]`) is less than the found index.
       - If a valid index is found, it calculates the minimum number of seconds it takes for slime `i` to be eaten and updates `ans[i]`.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function correctly handles the case where `x` is less than 0 by returning `-1`.
     - The `bisect_left` function is used to find the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to `x`.
     - If `a[inx]` is equal to `x`, it returns `inx + 1`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `inx`.
     - This function is correct and efficient.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - The function correctly initializes `left` and `last` lists.
     - The `left` list is built correctly as a prefix sum array.
     - The `last` list is built correctly to keep track of the last index where the size of the slime is different from the previous one.
     - The main loop iterates through the slimes from left to right:
       - If `a[i]` is less than `a[i-1]`, it correctly sets `ans[i]` to `1`.
       - Otherwise, it calculates `x` as `left[i] - a[i] - 1`.
       - It uses `func_1` to find the index `inx` and checks if `last[i-1]` is less than `inx`.
       - If a valid index is found, it correctly updates `ans[i]` to `i + 1 - inx`.
     - The function correctly handles the case where a slime cannot be eaten by any other slime by leaving `ans[i]` as `-1`.

4. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of slimes `n` and the sizes of the slimes `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` twice: once for the original list `a` and once for the reversed list `a[::-1]`.
   - It then combines the results from both calls to ensure the minimum number of seconds for each slime to be eaten.
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no slimes (`n = 0`), the function implicitly returns an empty list, which is correct.
   - If all slimes have the same size, no slime can eat another, and all values in `ans` should remain `-1`, which is correctly handled by the program.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The prefix sum array `left` is built in `O(n)` time.
   - The `last` array is built in `O(n)` time.
   - The main loop iterates through the slimes in `O(n)` time.
   - The `bisect_left` operation inside `func_1` is `O(log n)`.
   - The overall complexity is `O(n log n)` per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten or to report `-1` if it is impossible. The annotated code and the original assessment align with the problem requirements and the program's behavior. The program efficiently handles all edge cases and produces the correct output.

Final: **True**
