Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` is set to `last[1]`. If `a[2]` is less than `a[1]`, `ans[2]` is 1; otherwise, `ans[2]` remains unchanged. The `continue` statement does not change any variable values but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next iteration of the loop.**
