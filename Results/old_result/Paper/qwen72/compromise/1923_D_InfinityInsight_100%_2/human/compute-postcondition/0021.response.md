Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0 and the cumulative sum of elements from `a` up to the current index, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, `i` is the next element in `a`, and `left` has been updated to include a new element which is the sum of the last element in `left` and `i`.**
