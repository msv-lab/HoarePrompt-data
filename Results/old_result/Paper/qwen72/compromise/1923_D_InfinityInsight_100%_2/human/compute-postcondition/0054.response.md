The `continue` statement is executed, which means no further changes are made to the variables in the current iteration. The values of `i`, `n`, `x`, `inx`, `inx2`, and `ans[3]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `x` is `left[2] - a[2] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[1]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` is set to `last[1]`. If `a[2]` is less than `a[1]`, `ans[2]` is 1; otherwise, `ans[2]` remains unchanged. `ans[3]` is set to 1.**
