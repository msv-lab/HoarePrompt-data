The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` must start at 1.

- `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

The other variables (`a`, `left`, `last`, `ans`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted. However, their initial states are important to ensure the loop can run correctly.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
