Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `x` is `left[3] - a[3] - 1`, `inx` is the value returned by `func_1(left, x)`, `inx2` is `last[2]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, then `inx` is set to `last[2]`. The values of `ans[2]` and `ans[3]` remain unchanged. If `inx` is less than 0, the `continue` statement is executed, and no further changes are made to the variables in the current iteration.**
