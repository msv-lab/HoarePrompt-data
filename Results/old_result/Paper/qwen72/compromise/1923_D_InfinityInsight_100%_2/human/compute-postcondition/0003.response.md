The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop starts at `i = 1` and goes up to `n-1`. If `n` is 1 or less, the loop will not execute. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- `n` is a non-negative integer such that n = len(a).
- `left` is a list containing the integer 0.
- `last` is a list containing the integer -1.
- `ans` is a list of length n, where each element is -1.

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 3 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `n` is a non-negative integer such that n = len(a) and n must be greater than 1, `left` is a list containing the integer 0, `last` is a list containing the integer -1, `ans` is a list of length n, where each element is -1, `i` is 1**
