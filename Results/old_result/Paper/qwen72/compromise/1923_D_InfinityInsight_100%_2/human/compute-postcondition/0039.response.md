Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. The second element of `a` is either less than or not less than the first element of `a`. If the second element of `a` is less than the first element, `ans[1]` is set to 1; otherwise, `ans[1]` remains unchanged. `x` is set to `left[1] - a[1] - 1`, `inx` is set to the result of `func_1(left, x)`, and `inx2` is set to `last[0]`. If `inx2` is less than `inx`, `inx2` is set to `last[0]` and `inx` is also set to `last[0]`, making `inx2` less than or equal to `inx`. If `inx` is less than 0, the loop continues to the next iteration. `ans[1]` is set to `2 - inx`.**
