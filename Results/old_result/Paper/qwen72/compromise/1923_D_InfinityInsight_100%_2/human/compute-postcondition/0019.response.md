Output State: **`a` is a list of integers where \(1 \leq \text{len}(a) \leq 3 \times 10^5\) and each element \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(n = \text{len}(a)\), `left` is a list containing the integer 0 and the cumulative sum of elements from `a` up to the current index, `last` is a list of length \(n\) where the first element is -1 and subsequent elements are the indices of the last occurrence of each distinct element in `a` up to that point, `ans` is a list of length \(n\), where each element is -1, and `i` will be set to each element of `a` during the loop.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `left` starts as a list containing the integer 0.
- The code `left.append(left[-1] + i)` appends the sum of the last element in `left` and the current element `i` (which is an element from `a`) to the list `left`.
- This means `left` will now contain the cumulative sum of elements from `a` as the loop progresses.
- The other variables (`a`, `n`, `last`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
- The state of `i` is not explicitly tracked in the output state, but it will be set to each element of `a` during the loop.
