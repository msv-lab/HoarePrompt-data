The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This means the variable `t` (which is the number of test cases) must be at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder for the loop iteration**
