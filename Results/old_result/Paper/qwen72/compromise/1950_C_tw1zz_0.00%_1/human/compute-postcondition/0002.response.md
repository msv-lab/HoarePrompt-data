Output State: The function will take the input string `s` representing a time in 24-hour format (hh:mm) and convert it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation. For each test case, it will print the converted time. The variables `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will be updated for each iteration based on the input time, and the final state of these variables will depend on the last input time processed. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. After the loop finishes, the state of `h1`, `m1`, and `time` will reflect the last time conversion performed. The initial state of `s` and `t` will remain unchanged. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3
01:15
13:30
23:45
```
The output will be:
```
01:15 AM
01:30 PM
11:45 PM
```
And the final state of the variables will be:
- `h1` = '11'
- `m1` = '45'
- `time` = 'PM'
