Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases using `int(input())`. This is appropriate as it expects an integer input.
   - For each test case, it reads a time string in the format `hh:mm` and splits it into `h` (hour) and `m` (minute) using `input().split(':')`. This is also correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - The function uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour (`h`) to the 12-hour format hour (`h1`) and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - For hours 01 to 11, the function correctly sets `h1` to the same value as `h` and `time` to `AM`.
   - For hour 12, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `AM`. However, this is incorrect according to the 12-hour clock convention, where 12:00 in the afternoon should be `12:00 PM`, not `12:00 AM`.
   - For hours 13 to 23, the function correctly sets `h1` to the corresponding 12-hour format hour (13 becomes 01, 14 becomes 02, and so on) and `time` to `PM`.
   - For hour 00, the function correctly sets `h1` to `12` and `time` to `PM`.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The function prints the converted time in the format `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM` using `print(h1, ':', m, ' ', time, sep='')`. This is correct as it ensures the output is formatted exactly as required by the problem description, with no extra spaces or leading/trailing characters.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is `00` and converts it to `12:00 PM`.
   - However, it incorrectly handles the edge case where the hour is `12` and converts it to `12:00 AM` instead of `12:00 PM`.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The function correctly converts most valid 24-hour format times to their 12-hour format equivalents.
   - The incorrect handling of the `12` hour case means that the function does not meet all the requirements of the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is incorrect due to the misclassification of the 12:00 hour as `AM` instead of `PM`.

Final: **False**
