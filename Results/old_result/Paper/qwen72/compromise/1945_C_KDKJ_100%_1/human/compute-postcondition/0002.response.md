To determine the output state, we need to understand what `func_1()` does. However, since the function `func_1()` is not defined in the provided code, we can only assume that it does not modify any variables or have any side effects. Therefore, the loop will simply execute `func_1()` the number of times specified by the user input, but it will not change the initial state of any variables.

Given the initial state is `None`, and no variables are modified within the loop, the output state remains unchanged.

Output State: **None.**
