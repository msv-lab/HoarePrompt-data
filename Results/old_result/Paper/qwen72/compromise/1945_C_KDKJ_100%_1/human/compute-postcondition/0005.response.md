Output State: **`S` is a list containing `n+1` sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` at index `i` (0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ n) represents the count of '0's and '1's in the first `i` characters of the string `a`. The last sublist in `S` is `[count of '0's in a, count of '1's in a]`. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. `ans` is -1.**
