Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by a string `a` representing the difficulties of the problems. The function `func_1` counts the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `a` and calculates the number of additional problems needed to ensure that there are at least `m` problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). The program then prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output based on the problem description.
