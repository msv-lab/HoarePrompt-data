### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets with the opponent or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is symmetric and the total number of coins (a + b) plays a crucial role.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a way where both players have an equal number of moves. Since Alice starts, Bob will always have the last move and win.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, Alice will have one more move than Bob. Therefore, Alice can always ensure that she has the last move and win.

3. **Bitwise Operation:**
   - The program uses the bitwise AND operation `a + b & 1` to check if the total number of coins is odd or even.
   - `a + b & 1` is equivalent to checking if the least significant bit of `a + b` is 1 (odd) or 0 (even).
   - If `a + b & 1 == 0`, the total number of coins is even, and Bob wins.
   - If `a + b & 1 == 1`, the total number of coins is odd, and Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd using the bitwise AND operation.
   - Based on the result, it prints "Bob" if the sum is even and "Alice" if the sum is odd.

5. **Annotated Code Review:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the program's behavior.
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `a` and `b`.
   - The bitwise operation `a + b & 1` is used to determine the parity of the sum.
   - The output is correctly generated based on the parity check.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where both `a` and `b` are 1 correctly. In this case, the sum is 2 (even), and Bob wins.
   - The program also handles cases where the number of coins is large (up to \(10^9\)) correctly, as the bitwise operation is efficient and works within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the optimal strategy and the parity of the total number of coins. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
