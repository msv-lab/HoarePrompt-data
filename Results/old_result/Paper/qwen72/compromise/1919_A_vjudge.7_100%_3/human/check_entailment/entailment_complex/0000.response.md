Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func` does not take any parameters, which is a deviation from the expected behavior. The function should take parameters `t`, `a`, and `b` to handle multiple test cases. However, the function reads these values from the input, which is a common practice in competitive programming. Therefore, this is not a critical issue.

2. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `test` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a` and `b` for each case. This is in line with the problem description.

3. **Winning Condition**: The function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even using the bitwise AND operation `a + b & 1 == 0`. This is correct because:
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is even, the result of `a + b & 1` will be `0`.
   - If the sum of `a` and `b` is odd, the result of `a + b & 1` will be `1`.

4. **Output**: The function correctly prints 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. This aligns with the problem's requirement that the player who cannot make a valid move loses, and the game's outcome can be determined by the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge cases where `a` and `b` are both 1, and where `a` and `b` are both very large (up to \(10^9\)). The logic of checking the parity of the sum is robust and works for all valid inputs.

6. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function correctly processes multiple test cases by using a loop to iterate over the number of test cases specified by `test`.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
