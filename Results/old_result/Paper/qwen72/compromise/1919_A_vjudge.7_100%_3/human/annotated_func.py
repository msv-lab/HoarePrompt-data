#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, where a and b are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, a, b):`
def func():
    test = int(input())
    for t in range(test):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a + b & 1 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of `a` and `b` are unchanged for each test case. The output for each test case is 'Bob' if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' if the sum is odd. The variable `t` has been incremented from 0 to `test - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `test` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. It then checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even. If the sum is even, it prints 'Bob'. If the sum is odd, it prints 'Alice'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The values of `a` and `b` are unchanged for each test case, and the variable `t` is incremented from 0 to `test - 1`.
