You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a string `s` of length 5 with the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format, where `hh` is the hour (00 to 23) and `mm` is the minute (00 to 59). The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440).
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: The loop will convert each input time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and print it, followed by 'AM' or 'PM' depending on the time. The variable `t` will have iterated through all the test cases, and the variable `s` will hold the last input time string. The hour part of the last input time will be stored in `h`. The loop will have printed the converted times for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) representing the number of test cases and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in 24-hour format. It processes each test case and returns the processed result for each valid time string.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
