The code snippet `n, k, x = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into three parts, and assigns these parts to the variables `n`, `k`, and `x` after converting them to integers.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder that will start at 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.**
