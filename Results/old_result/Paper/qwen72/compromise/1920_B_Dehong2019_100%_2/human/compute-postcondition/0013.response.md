Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `i` is `x-1`, `ans2` is equal to `ans1`.**

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the value of `ans1` to `ans2`. Since `ans1` is already defined as the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, `ans2` now holds the same value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
