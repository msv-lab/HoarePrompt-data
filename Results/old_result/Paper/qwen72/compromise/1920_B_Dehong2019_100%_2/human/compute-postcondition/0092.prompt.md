Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the integer value provided by the input, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n, and `a_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())), reverse=True)
    ans1 = sum(a)
    for i in range(x):
        ans1 -= a[i] * 2
    ans2 = ans1
    for i in range(k):
        ans1 += a[i]
        if i + x < n:
            ans1 -= a[i + x] * 2
        ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)
    print(ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus twice the sum of the elements from `a[x]` to `a[x + k - 1]` (if `x + k - 1` is less than `n`), and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` encountered during the loop iterations.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus `2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+k-1])`, and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` during the loop execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the new input, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus `2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[x+k-1])` if `x + k - 1 < n`, otherwise `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus the sum of the first `k` elements of `a` minus `2 * (a[x] + a[x+1] + ... + a[n-1])`, `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` after all iterations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
