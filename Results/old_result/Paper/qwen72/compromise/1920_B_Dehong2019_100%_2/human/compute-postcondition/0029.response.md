Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x + 1`, `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`.** 

The code snippet `ans2 = max(ans1, ans2)` updates the value of `ans2` to be the maximum of `ans1` and its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
