Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x + 1`. If `i + x < n`, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 - 2 * a[x + 1 + x]` and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`. Otherwise, `ans1` is updated to `ans1 + a[x + 1]` and `ans2` is the maximum of `ans1` and the previous value of `ans2`.***
