Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `i` is `x-1`. If `i + x` is less than `n`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, and `ans2` remains the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`. Otherwise, `ans1` and `ans2` retain their initial values as described in the precondition.***
