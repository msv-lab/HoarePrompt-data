Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order based on the new input, `i` is `k-1`, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, and `ans2` is the maximum value of `ans1` during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans1 = sum(a)` assigns the sum of all integers in the list `a` to the variable `ans1`.
- No other variables are affected by this code.
- The initial state conditions for `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `i`, and `ans2` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`.
