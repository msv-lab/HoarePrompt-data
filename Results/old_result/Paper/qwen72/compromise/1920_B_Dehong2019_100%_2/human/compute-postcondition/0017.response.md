Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])` plus `a[x-1]` minus `2 * a[i + x]`, `i` is `x-1`, `ans2` is equal to the sum of all integers in the list `a` minus `2 * (a[0] + a[1] + ... + a[x-1])`, and the current value of `i + x` is less than `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans1` is updated by subtracting `2 * a[i + x]` from its previous value.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
