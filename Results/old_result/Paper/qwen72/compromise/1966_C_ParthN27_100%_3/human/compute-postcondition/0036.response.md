Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of the sorted list `s`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr` up to the `n`-th index, with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0, indicating that the loop did not break due to a difference greater than 1 between any two consecutive elements in `s`.**
