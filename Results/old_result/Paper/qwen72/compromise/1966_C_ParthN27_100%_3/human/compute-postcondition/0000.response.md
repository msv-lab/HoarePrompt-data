To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the loop variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The loop variable `_` is not something we need to adjust explicitly since it is initialized by the loop itself.
2. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. This means the input provided to the program must be a positive integer.

Given the state before the loop starts, the input `t` (representing the number of test cases) must be a positive integer for the loop to execute. The other details about the list of lists and the constraints on `t`, `n`, and `a_i` are not directly relevant to the loop head, but they are part of the overall context.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is initialized by the loop**
