Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user, processes multiple test cases, and prints the winner of a game ('Alice' or 'Bob') for each test case. Each test case involves a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function determines the winner based on the unique, sorted values of the stones in each pile, with an additional 0 prepended to the list. If the list of unique stones has only two elements, 'Alice' wins. Otherwise, the function checks if there is at least one consecutive pair of elements (excluding the first element, which is 0) where the difference is exactly 1. If such a pair exists, 'Alice' wins; otherwise, 'Bob' wins. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. **
