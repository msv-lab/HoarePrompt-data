Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code `s.add(arr[i])` adds the second element of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Initially, `s` contained only the first element of `arr`. After the code execution, `s` now contains both the first and the second elements of `arr`. The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged.
