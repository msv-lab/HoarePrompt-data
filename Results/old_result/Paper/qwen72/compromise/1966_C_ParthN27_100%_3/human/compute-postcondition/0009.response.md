Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a set containing `arr[i-1]`, `arr[i]`, and `arr[i+1]`, `i` is `i + 1`**

The set `s` now includes the elements `arr[i-1]`, `arr[i]`, and `arr[i+1]` after adding `arr[i+1]` to it. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, and all other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
