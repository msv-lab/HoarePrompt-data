Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a sorted list containing all elements of `arr` from index 0 to index `n-1`, with an additional 0 at the beginning. `ans` is 1, indicating that either the loop broke early because the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` was greater than 1, or the number of elements in `s` from index 1 to `n-2` where the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1 is odd. If the loop broke early, `i` is the index where the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` was greater than 1; otherwise, `i` is `n-2`.**
