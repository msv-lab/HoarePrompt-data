Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is a list containing the first `n` unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning, `i` is 1, and `ans` is 0. Additionally, the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i - 1]` is less than or equal to 1.**

The code `ans ^= 1` toggles the value of `ans` between 0 and 1. Since `ans` was initially 1, after executing this code, `ans` becomes 0. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
