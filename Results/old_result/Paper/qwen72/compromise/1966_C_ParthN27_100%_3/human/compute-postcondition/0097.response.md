The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('Alice')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is the length of `s` and is equal to 2.
   - `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `s` is a list containing the first 2 unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order with an additional 0 at the beginning.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is 1.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement simply prints the string 'Alice'.
   - The values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, and `ans` are not used in this `print` statement.

### Output:
The code prints the string 'Alice'.
Output: **Alice**
