### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows `row1` and `row2`.
   - It stores each test case as a tuple `(n, (row1, row2))` in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case and determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - This initialization is correct because the robot starts at `(1, 1)` and can initially only be in the first row.

4. **Loop Through Columns**:
   - The function iterates through each column `j` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - It checks the current state of the robot and updates the reachability flags based on the direction of the arrows in the current column.

5. **First Row Check**:
   - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row and potentially reach the target).
     - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
       - The robot can no longer stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
       - If the robot is not at the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row).

6. **Second Row Check**:
   - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
     - If the arrow in the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
       - If the robot is at the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can reach the target).

7. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results list.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Issues in the Original Program:
- **First Row Check**:
  - The logic for updating `reachable_second_row` is incorrect. The robot should be able to move to the second row if the arrow in the first row points to the right and the arrow in the second row points to the right, regardless of the current column index.
  - The original program only sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` if the robot is at the last column and the arrow in the first row points to the right, which is not sufficient.

- **Second Row Check**:
  - The logic for updating `reachable_first_row` is missing. The robot should be able to move back to the first row if the arrow in the second row points to the left and the arrow in the first row points to the right.
  - The original program does not handle this case, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot can move to the second row from the first row if the arrow in the first row points to the right and the arrow in the second row points to the right.
- The robot can move back to the first row from the second row if the arrow in the second row points to the left and the arrow in the first row points to the right.
- The robot can reach the target if it is in the second row at the last column and the arrow points to the right.

### Corrected Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable_first_row = True
        reachable_second_row = False
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                    elif row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
                        reachable_first_row = False
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        results.append('YES')
                        break
                if row2[j] == '<' and row1[j] == '>':
                    reachable_first_row = True
                    reachable_second_row = False
        if not results or results[-1] != 'YES':
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program has logical issues that prevent it from correctly determining if the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
- The corrected program addresses these issues and should correctly determine the reachability of the target cell.

Final: **False** (The original program is incorrect, but the corrected program is correct.)
