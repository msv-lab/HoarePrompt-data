### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `row1` and `row2`, which represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
   - The test cases are stored in a list `test_cases` as tuples `(n, (row1, row2))`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
   - It initializes two boolean variables `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track whether the robot can reach the end of the first and second rows, respectively.
   - The function then iterates over each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - If the robot is in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`):
       - If the arrow in the current cell of the first row points to the right (`row1[j] == '>'`):
         - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row and reach the end).
       - If the arrow in the current cell of the first row points to the left (`row1[j] == '<'`):
         - The robot cannot stay in the first row, so `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`.
         - If the robot is not in the last column (`j < n - 1`) and the arrow in the current cell of the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can move to the second row and continue moving right).
     - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`):
       - If the arrow in the current cell of the second row points to the right (`row2[j] == '>'`):
         - If the robot is in the last column (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` (indicating the robot can reach the end of the second row).

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, the function returns a list `results` containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
   - The main program then prints each result.

### Issues:
- **Logic for `reachable_second_row`:** The logic for updating `reachable_second_row` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if j == n - 1: reachable_second_row = True` is redundant and incorrect because it doesn't change the state of `reachable_second_row` if it was already `False`. Additionally, the logic for moving from the first row to the second row is not correctly handled.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot should be able to move from the first row to the second row if it encounters a right arrow in the first row and the corresponding cell in the second row has a right arrow.
- The robot should be able to stay in the second row and move to the end if it encounters a right arrow in the second row.

### Correctness:
- The current logic does not correctly handle the transition from the first row to the second row and the movement within the second row.
- The robot should be able to move to the second row and continue moving right if the conditions are met.

### Conclusion:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

### Correctness: **False**
