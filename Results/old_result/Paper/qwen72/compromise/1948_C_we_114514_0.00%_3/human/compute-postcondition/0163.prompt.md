Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case in test_cases is a tuple (n, row1, row2) where n is an even integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and row1 and row2 are strings of length n containing only the characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for test_case in test_cases:
    n, (row1, row2) = test_case
    reachable_first_row = True
    reachable_second_row = False
    for j in range(n):
        if reachable_first_row:
            if row1[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
            else:
                reachable_first_row = False
                if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                    reachable_second_row = True
        if reachable_second_row:
            if row2[j] == '>':
                if j == n - 1:
                    reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        results.append('YES')
    else:
        results.append('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 1 test case, `test_case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the first test case, `row1` is the second element of the first test case, `row2` is the third element of the first test case, `reachable_first_row` is False if any character in `row1` is not '>', otherwise it remains True, `reachable_second_row` is either True or False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` contains 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if the last character of `row2` is '>', otherwise it remains False. If `reachable_second_row` is True, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' or 'NO' and now includes an additional 'YES'. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'. If `reachable_second_row` is true, `results` also contains an additional 'YES'. Otherwise, `results` contains an additional 'NO'. `j` is `n - 1`, and `reachable_first_row` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
