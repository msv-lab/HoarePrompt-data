Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is True, `reachable_second_row` is False, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    if reachable_first_row:
        if row1[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True
        else:
            reachable_first_row = False
            if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                reachable_second_row = True
    if reachable_second_row:
        if row2[j] == '>':
            if j == n - 1:
                reachable_second_row = True


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO'. If `reachable_second_row` is True and the character at position `j` in `row2` is '>', and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, then `j` is the last position in `row2`. If `reachable_first_row` is True, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` are updated based on the conditions described in the if part. If `reachable_second_row` is False, the values of `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO', `j` is `n`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, then `reachable_second_row` remains True. If `j` == `n` - 1, `reachable_second_row` is True, and `reachable_first_row` is False if `row1[j]` != '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is not affected. If `j` < `n` - 1 and `row2[j]` != '>', then `reachable_second_row` is False and `reachable_first_row` is False if `row1[j]` != '>', otherwise `reachable_first_row` is not affected. If `reachable_second_row` is False, then `reachable_second_row` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) with at least 3 test cases, `test_case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the third test case, `row2` is the third element of the third test case, `results` is a list containing the strings 'YES' and 'NO', `j` is `n - 1`. If `reachable_second_row` is True, and `row2[j]` == '>', and `j` == `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains True and `reachable_first_row` is not affected. If `reachable_second_row` is True, and `row2[j]` == '>', and `j` < `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain as they were before the if statement. If `reachable_second_row` is True, and `row2[j]` != '>', `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` remain as they were before the if statement. If `reachable_second_row` is False, `reachable_second_row` remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
