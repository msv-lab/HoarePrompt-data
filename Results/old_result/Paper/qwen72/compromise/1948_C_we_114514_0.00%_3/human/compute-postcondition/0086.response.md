Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is 1. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row1[j] == '>'` and `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` is set to True. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row1[j] == '>'` and `j < n - 1`, `reachable_second_row` remains True or False as determined by the precondition. If `reachable_first_row` is True and `row1[j] != '>'`, `reachable_first_row` is set to False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if `j < n - 1` and `row2[j] == '>'`, otherwise `reachable_second_row` retains its value as determined by the precondition. If `reachable_first_row` is False, `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` retain their values as determined by the precondition.***
