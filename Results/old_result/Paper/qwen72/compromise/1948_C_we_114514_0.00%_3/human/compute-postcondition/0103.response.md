Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples (n, row1, row2) that must have at least 2 test cases, `test_case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing either the string 'YES' or 'NO', `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than 0, `row1` is the second element of the second test case, `row2` is the third element of the second test case, `j` is `n - 1`, `reachable_first_row` is False, and `reachable_second_row` is True if the last character of `row2` is '>', otherwise it remains False.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is the length of `row1` and `row2`.
- `reachable_first_row` starts as True and can become False if any character in `row1` is not '>'.
- `reachable_second_row` starts as False and can become True if any character in `row1` is not '>' and the corresponding character in `row2` is '>', or if the last character in `row1` is '>' and the loop reaches the end.
- After all iterations, `j` will be `n - 1`.
- `reachable_first_row` will be False if any character in `row1` is not '>', otherwise it will remain True.
- `reachable_second_row` will be True if the last character of `row2` is '>', otherwise it will remain False.
