Postcondition: **`path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity. The length of `path` is at least 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `path`. `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. `dp` is a list of length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest of the elements in `dp` are zeros. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf` and the rest of the elements in `dp` are zeros. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros. The second element of `path` is '*'.**
