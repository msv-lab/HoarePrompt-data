To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 0. The variable `t` and the values of `a` and `b` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`.
2. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
3. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.
4. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
