#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, edges is a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n and each tuple represents an edge in the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `edges` is a list of tuples (u, v) that contains all the tuples it initially had, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where for each tuple (u, v) in `edges`, `tree[u]` contains `v` and `tree[v]` contains `u`.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'.
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first and second leaf nodes, calculating the distances. If either of these distances is even, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and target are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, and the tree is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `start` and `target` remain integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `queue` is now empty, indicating that all nodes reachable from `start` have been processed. `visited` is a set containing all nodes that were visited during the execution of the loop, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `target` was found, the loop returned the distance `dist` from `start` to `target`. If `target` was not found, the loop has finished without returning a distance, and `visited` contains all nodes that were reachable from `start`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that the target node was not found in the tree starting from the start node.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, which are integers representing node indices in a tree. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `start` node is the same as the `target` node, it returns 0. If the `target` node is found during the BFS, it returns the distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the BFS completes and the `target` node is not found, it returns -1, indicating that the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node.
