The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), `edges` (a list of tuples (u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, representing the starting node for the game). It constructs a tree from the `edges` and identifies the leaves of the tree. It then performs a breadth-first search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first and second leaf nodes, calculating the distances. If either of these distances is even, the function returns the string 'Ron'. Otherwise, it returns the string 'Hermione'.
