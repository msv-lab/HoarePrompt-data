Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list. `current` is the last node processed that is not equal to `target`. `dist` is the distance from `start` to the last node processed. `queue` is a deque containing tuples of nodes and their respective distances from `start` that have not yet been processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `start` and `target` variables remain unchanged as they represent the initial and target node indices, respectively. The `tree[start]` is still a non-empty list, indicating the adjacency list of the starting node. The `current` variable holds the last node that was processed by the loop, which is not equal to `target`. The `dist` variable holds the distance from the `start` node to the last processed node. The `queue` is a deque that contains tuples of nodes and their respective distances from `start` that have not yet been processed. The `visited` set contains all the nodes that have been visited during the execution of the loop, including the `start` node and all its neighbors that were not previously visited.
