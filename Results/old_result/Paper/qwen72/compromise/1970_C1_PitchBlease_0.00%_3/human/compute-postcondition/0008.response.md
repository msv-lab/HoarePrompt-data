Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single element, which is a tuple containing the value of `start` and 0, `visited` is a set containing the value of `start`, `current` is not equal to `target`, and `neighbor` is not in the set `visited`.**
