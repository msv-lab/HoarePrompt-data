Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n, `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list, `current` is `start`, `dist` is 0, `queue` is a deque initialized with a single element, which is a tuple containing the value of `start` and 0. `queue` now contains an additional tuple `(neighbor, dist + 1)`, and `visited` contains the values of `start` and `neighbor`. `current` is not equal to `target`. `neighbor` is the next element in `tree[start]`.**
