Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` must be a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are now the values of the first tuple that was in `queue`, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`. `queue` now contains the remaining tuples, excluding the one that was just processed. `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors that were not previously visited. `queue` must contain at least one tuple, unless the deque was empty after the `popleft` operation.**
