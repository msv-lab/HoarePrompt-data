Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. The tree is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single element, which is a tuple containing the value of `start` and 0. `visited` is a set containing the value of `start`. `current` is now equal to `start`, and `dist` is now 0. The first element of `queue` has been removed. Additionally, `current` is not equal to `target`.**
