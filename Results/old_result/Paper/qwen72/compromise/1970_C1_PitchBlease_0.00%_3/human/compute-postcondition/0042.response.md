Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` and `dist` are updated to the values of the tuple that was at the front of `queue` before the operation, with `current` being the node and `dist` being its distance from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited. If `current` is equal to `target`, the program returns the distance `dist` of the node `current` from the starting node `start`.**
