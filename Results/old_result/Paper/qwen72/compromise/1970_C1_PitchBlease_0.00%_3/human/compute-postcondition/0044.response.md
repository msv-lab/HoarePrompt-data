Postcondition: **`start` and `target` are integers representing node indices in the tree, where 1 <= start, target <= n. `tree[start]` is a non-empty list. `current` is a valid node index, and `tree[current]` is a non-empty list. `neighbor` is the first element in `tree[current]`, and `neighbor` is not in the `visited` set. `dist` is the distance of `current` from `start`. `queue` is now one tuple shorter, and `visited` is a set containing all the nodes that have been visited, including `start` and all its neighbors, and all other nodes that were reachable and not previously visited.**
