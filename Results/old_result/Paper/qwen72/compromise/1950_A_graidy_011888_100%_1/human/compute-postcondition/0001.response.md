To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The state provided includes information about `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, but these are not directly relevant to the loop head. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `i` will start from 0.

Given the state:
- The function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- For each iteration, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9).
- `n` is an input integer.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(n):
```

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
