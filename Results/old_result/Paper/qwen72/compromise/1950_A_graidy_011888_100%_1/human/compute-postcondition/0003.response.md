The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each iteration, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9). However, the function signature provided does not include these parameters, which suggests that the function might be using these values from an external source or context (e.g., global variables or passed through another mechanism).

Given the constraints and the lack of parameters in the function signature, the functionality of the function `func` is not fully clear from the provided information. However, based on the context, we can infer that the function is expected to process these three digits in some way during each iteration of the loop.

Since the output is not specified, I will describe the functionality based on the input constraints and the typical behavior of such functions:

Functionality: **The function processes three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9) in each of `t` iterations (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), but the specific output or return value is not provided.**
