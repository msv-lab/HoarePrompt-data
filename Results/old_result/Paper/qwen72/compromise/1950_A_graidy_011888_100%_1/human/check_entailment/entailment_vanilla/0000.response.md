Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times, which is correct for handling multiple test cases.
3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is the correct way to read the input as described in the problem.
4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct according to the problem description.
5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct according to the problem description.
6. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct default case as per the problem description.
7. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, which is either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE".

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles all the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
