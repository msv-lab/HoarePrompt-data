Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `n` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. This aligns with the problem description.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program enters a loop that runs `n` times, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases.
3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is the correct method for reading the input as specified in the problem.
4. **Condition for Stair**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct and matches the problem description.
5. **Condition for Peak**: The program checks if `a < b` and `b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct and matches the problem description.
6. **Default Case**: If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct default case as per the problem description.
7. **Output**: The program prints the correct output for each test case, which is either "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE". The output format matches the problem description.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the `func` function. It correctly states that the function processes `n` iterations, reads three digits for each iteration, and prints the appropriate output based on the conditions specified.

Given the above reasoning and the function summary, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and handles all the specified conditions.

Final: **True**
