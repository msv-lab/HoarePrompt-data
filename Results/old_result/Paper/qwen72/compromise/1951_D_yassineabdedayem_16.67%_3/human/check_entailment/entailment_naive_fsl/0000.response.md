Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `k` correctly. According to the problem description, if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it should be impossible to fulfill the task, and the program should output "NO". However, the current logic in the program does not check this condition and may incorrectly proceed to set up stalls, leading to an incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 6
```
Here, Alice has 5 coins but Bob wants her to buy 6 jewels. Since Alice cannot buy 6 jewels with only 5 coins, the correct output should be "NO". However, the program will incorrectly attempt to set up stalls and may output a "YES" with an invalid setup.
