Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical flaw in its approach to solving the problem. The algorithm attempts to distribute the coins and jewels across stalls, but the logic for determining the prices and the number of jewels to be bought from each stall is incorrect. Specifically, the conditions and calculations within the while loop do not correctly ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels while adhering to the constraints of the problem.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `Min` and `Max`:**
   - The calculation of `Min` and `Max` is not appropriate for the problem. The goal is to set prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, but the logic for determining these prices is flawed.
   - The conditions `(Min, Max) = (min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k))` and the subsequent checks do not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Buying Jewels:**
   - The logic for buying jewels from each stall is not correct. The program tries to buy `Min` or `Max` jewels from each stall, but this does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels in total.
   - The condition `n * Min <= k` is not necessary and does not make sense in the context of the problem.

3. **Handling the Remaining Coins and Jewels:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the remaining coins and jewels after each stall. The update `n -= Min * Max` and `k = k - Min` or `k = k - Max` does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve setting up stalls with prices that ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. One simple and effective way to do this is to set up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin. This way, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, and the total number of stalls will be `k`, which is always less than or equal to 60 since `1 \le k \le 10^{18}` and `1 \le n \le 10^{18}`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > 60:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(k)
            for i in range(1, k + 1):
                print(1, end=' ')
            print()

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Input Handling:** The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
- **Stall Setup:** If `k` is greater than 60, it is impossible to set up the store as required, so the program prints "NO".
- **Price Setting:** If `k` is 60 or less, the program prints "YES" and sets up `k` stalls, each with a price of 1 coin. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

This approach is simple and guarantees the correct solution for all valid inputs.
