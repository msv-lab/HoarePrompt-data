You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k`. The function then attempts to decompose `n` into a sum of products of integers, where each product is formed by a pair of integers whose values are determined by the current values of `n` and `k`. The function keeps track of these products in a list `tab`. If it successfully decomposes `n` such that `k` becomes 0, it prints 'YES', the length of `tab`, and the elements of `tab`. If it cannot decompose `n` to make `k` 0, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, `t` is 0, and the state of `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number` is undefined for the next test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping Through Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `rep` to 0, which will count the number of stalls set up.
   - It also initializes `number` to 0, which will store the price per jewel for the current stall.
   - `tab` is initialized as an empty list to store the prices of the stalls.

3. **Stall Setup and Price Calculation:**
   - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively.
   - The logic then checks if `Max` equals `k` and if `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`. If both conditions are true, it sets `number` to `Min` and decreases `k` by `Max`.
   - If the conditions are not met, it sets `number` to `Max` and decreases `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends the price `number` to the list `tab`.
   - It decreases `n` by `Min * Max` and increments `rep` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is zero, it prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

### Analysis:
- The program aims to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- The logic inside the while loop is designed to find a combination of prices and quantities that satisfy the conditions.
- However, there is a logical error in the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:`. This condition is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
- The correct approach should be to always set the price of the current stall to `n // k` and buy as many jewels as possible from that stall, then update `n` and `k` accordingly.
- The program should ensure that `k` is reduced to zero within the constraints of setting up at most 60 stalls and each stall having a price between 1 and \(10^{18}\).

### Corrected Logic:
- For each test case, Bob can set up stalls with prices such that the sum of the prices of the jewels Alice buys equals `n` and the total number of jewels bought equals `k`.
- The simplest way to achieve this is to set up stalls with prices that are powers of 2, as this ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels without exceeding the number of coins `n`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > 60:
            print('NO')
            continue
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        for i in range(k):
            price = 1 << i  # 2^i
            if n < price:
                price = n
            print(price, end=' ')
            n -= price
        print()

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- If `k` is greater than 60, it is impossible to set up the required number of stalls, so the program prints "NO".
- Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up `k` stalls with prices that are powers of 2.
- If `n` is less than the current power of 2, it sets the price to `n` to ensure Alice can buy the required number of jewels without exceeding her coins.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has a logical error in the condition inside the while loop, which can lead to incorrect results. The corrected program ensures that Bob can set up the stalls correctly to make Alice buy exactly `k` jewels.
