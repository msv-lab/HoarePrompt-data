Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`, `number` is `Min`, and `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`.**

The code snippet `number = Min` assigns the value of `Min` to the variable `number`. Since `Min` is defined as `min(n // k, k)`, `number` now holds this value. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.
