The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. The placeholder variable `_` is not relevant to the loop condition, so it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met), `k` is either 0 or a positive integer, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration, `i` is the last element in `tab` if `k` is 0, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.**
