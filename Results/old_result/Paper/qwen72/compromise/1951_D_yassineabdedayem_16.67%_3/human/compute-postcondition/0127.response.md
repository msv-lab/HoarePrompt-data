Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing two string representations of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`. If `Max` == `k` and `n * Min` <= `k`, then `number` is `min(n // k, k)` and `k` is `k - max(int(n / k), k)`. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- Initially, `tab` contains a single string representation of `number`.
- After the code execution, `tab` now contains two string representations of `number`.
- The values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `number` and `k` remains the same as in the initial state.
