Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `t` is 0 or a positive integer.
   - `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration and must have at least 3 elements.
   - `i` is the third element in `tab`.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
   - `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly defined as the third element in the list `tab`.
   - Since `tab` must have at least 3 elements, `i` will be the string representation of the third element in `tab`.

4. **Determine the Value of `i`:**
   - The list `tab` contains string representations of `number` for each iteration.
   - The third element in `tab` will be the string representation of the number at the third iteration.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the third element of `tab` followed by a space.

Given the initial state, the third element of `tab` is a string representation of a number. Since the exact values of the elements in `tab` are not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the list.

Output: **[third element of tab] (where the third element of tab is the string representation of the number at the third iteration in the list tab)**
