Based on the initial state, `tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of numbers, and `i` is the second element of `tab`.

1. **Identify the value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` is the second element of `tab`, and `tab` contains string representations of numbers, `i` will be a string representation of a number.

2. **Determine the output of the `print` statement**:
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `i` followed by a space (because of `end=' '`).

Therefore, the output will be the second element of `tab` followed by a space.

Output: **[second element of tab] (where the second element of tab is a string representation of a number)**
