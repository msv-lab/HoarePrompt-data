Output State: **`rep` is 2, `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is updated to either `k - Max` or `k - Min` and must be greater than zero, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with three elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number`, the second element is the string representation of the current `number`, and the third element is the string representation of the current `number` after the update, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is now `Min` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- The other variables (`rep`, `k`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, `Max`, and `number`) retain their conditions and values as described in the initial state, but `n` is now updated.
- The conditions for `k` and `number` remain the same, and the specific values of `Min` and `Max` will depend on the current values of `n` and `k`.
- `t` is still greater than 0 but is decremented by 1.
- `tab` still contains the string representations of the initial `number`, the current `number`, and the updated `number`.
- `i` remains `None`.
