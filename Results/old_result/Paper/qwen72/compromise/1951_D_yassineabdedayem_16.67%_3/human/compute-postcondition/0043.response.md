Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is a placeholder variable (not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met).
- `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met.
- `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of `number`.
- `i` is the first element in `tab`.
- `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
- `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **`tab`**: This is a list that contains at least one string representation of a number. The exact contents of `tab` are not specified, but we know it contains at least one string.
2. **`i`**: This is the first element in the list `tab`. Since `tab` contains at least one string, `i` will be a string representation of a number.

### What is printed:
The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `tab` followed by a space (since `end=' '` is specified).

### Final Output:
Output: **[i] (where [i] is the first element of the list `tab`)**

This output is the first string in the list `tab`, followed by a space. The exact value of `i` is not known without the specific contents of `tab`, but it is guaranteed to be a string representation of a number.
