Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `rep` is 60 or less.
   - `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `t` is 0 or a positive integer.
   - `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration and must have at least 1 element.
   - `i` is `None`.
   - `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
   - `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly stated to be `None` in the initial state.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function ensures that the output is followed by a space rather than a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - Since `i` is `None`, the `print` statement will output `None` followed by a space.

Therefore, the output of the provided code snippet is:
Output: **None **
