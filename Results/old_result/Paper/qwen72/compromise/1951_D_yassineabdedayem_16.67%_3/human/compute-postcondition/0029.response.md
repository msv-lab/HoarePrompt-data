Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- `Min` and `Max` are reassigned to the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively.
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `rep`, `tab`) remain unchanged.
- `Min` and `Max` are now specifically the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`, respectively.
- The value of `n` is now `n - Min * Max`.
