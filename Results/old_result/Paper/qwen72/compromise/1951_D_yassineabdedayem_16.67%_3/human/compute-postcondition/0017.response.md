The code snippet `rep += 1` increments the value of `rep` by 1. The initial value of `rep` is 0, so after the execution, `rep` will be 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is equal to `Min` and `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `k` is set to `k - Min`. `n` is now equal to `n - Min * Max`.**
