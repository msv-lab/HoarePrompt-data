The only objects in the loop head are the list `tab` and the variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tab`. If `tab` has more than one element, the loop will execute again with `i` set to the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration, `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a number, and `i` is the first element of `tab`. For the loop to execute one more time, `tab` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `tab`.

State: **`tab` is a list containing at least two string representations of numbers, `i` is the second element of `tab`**
