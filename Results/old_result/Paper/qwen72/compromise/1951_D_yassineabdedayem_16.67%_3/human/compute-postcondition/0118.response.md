Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`.**

Explanation:
- The initial value of `n` is a positive integer.
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`.
- The code `n -= Min * Max` updates the value of `n` by subtracting the product of `Min` and `Max` from `n`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
