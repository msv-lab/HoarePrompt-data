Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met), `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0, as it is not affected by the loop.
- The variable `_` remains a placeholder and is not changed.
- The variable `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` if the loop condition is still met; otherwise, the loop has stopped.
- The variable `k` is a positive integer, but its value has been updated through the loop iterations.
- The variable `rep` is either 60, indicating that the loop has run the maximum number of times, or it is less than 60, indicating that the loop condition became false before reaching 60 iterations.
- The variable `tab` is a list that contains the string representation of `number` for each iteration of the loop.
- The variables `Min` and `Max` hold the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` from the last iteration of the loop.
- The variable `n` is the final value after being updated by subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.
