Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with one element, which is the string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `Min, Max = min(n // k, k), max(int(n / k), k)` updates the values of `Min` and `Max`.
- `Min` is now the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is now the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- All other variables (`n`, `k`, `rep`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `number` and `k` updates are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as they were in the initial state.
