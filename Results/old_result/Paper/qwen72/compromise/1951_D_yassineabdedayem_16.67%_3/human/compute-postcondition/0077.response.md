Output State: **`n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`, `k` is updated to either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition, `rep` is 1, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list with two elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number` and the second element is the string representation of the current `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k` if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, otherwise `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.**

Explanation:
- `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`.
- `k` remains updated to either `k - Max` or `k - Min` depending on the condition.
- `rep` remains 1.
- `t` is still greater than 0 and has been decremented by 1.
- `tab` remains a list with two elements, where the first element is the string representation of the initial `number` and the second element is the string representation of the current `number`.
- `i` remains `None`.
- `Min` remains the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` remains the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- `number` is still determined by the condition: if `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`; otherwise, `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
