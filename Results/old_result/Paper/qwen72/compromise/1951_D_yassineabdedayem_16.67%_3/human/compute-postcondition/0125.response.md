Output State: **`rep` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is `k - Min`, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `number` is `Max`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`**

Explanation:
- `k` is decremented by `Min`, so the new value of `k` is `k - Min`.
- The values of `rep`, `n`, `number`, `t`, `tab`, `i`, `Min`, and `Max` remain as they were in the initial state, with `n` and `number` having been updated in the initial state by the expressions `n - Min * Max` and `Max` respectively.
