Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string representation of `number`, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is `k - max(n // k, k)`. Otherwise, `number` is `max(n // k, k)` and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, and `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`.**

Explanation:
- `tab.append(str(number))` adds the string representation of `number` to the list `tab`.
- The values of `rep`, `n`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `Min`, and `Max` remain unchanged.
- The value of `number` is determined based on the conditions provided in the initial state.
- `tab` now contains a single element, which is the string representation of `number`.
