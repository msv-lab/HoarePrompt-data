Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - Max` and `number` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - Min` and `number` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.***
