Output State: **`rep` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `tab` is an empty list, `i` is `None`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(n // k, k)`, `number` is `max(n // k, k)`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

The value of `number` is now equal to `Max`, which is `max(n // k, k)`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
