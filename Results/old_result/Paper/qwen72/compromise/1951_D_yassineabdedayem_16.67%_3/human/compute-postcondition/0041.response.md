Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is a placeholder variable (its value is not relevant to the problem).
3. `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k` (if the loop condition is still met).
4. `k` is a positive integer.
5. `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met.
6. `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration.
7. `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
8. `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.
9. `k` is 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(len(tab))
```

### Analysis:
- The list `tab` is described as containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration. However, the exact number of iterations is not specified in the initial state.
- The loop condition is not explicitly provided, but we can infer that the loop runs as long as `n` is greater than or equal to `k` and `k` is a positive integer.
- The variable `rep` is set to 60 or the loop condition is no longer met. This suggests that the loop runs a maximum of 60 times.
- After the loop, `k` is set to 0, which means the loop has completed its iterations.

### Conclusion:
- The length of `tab` will be the number of iterations the loop has run.
- Since the loop runs a maximum of 60 times and `k` is set to 0 after the loop, the length of `tab` will be 60.

### Output:
Output: **60** (where 60 is the number of iterations the loop has run, and `tab` contains the string representations of `number` for each iteration).
