Output State: **`rep` is 60 or less, `n` is 0 or a positive integer less than `k`, `k` is 0, `t` is 0 or a positive integer, `tab` is a list containing string representations of `number` for each iteration and has been fully iterated, `i` is the last element in `tab`, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `rep` remains 60 or less.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer less than `k` or 0.
- The variable `k` remains 0.
- The variable `t` remains a positive integer or 0.
- The list `tab` has been fully iterated through, meaning all elements in `tab` have been processed by the loop.
- The variable `i` is now the last element in `tab`.
- The variables `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and they remain unchanged after the loop.
- The variable `n` is the final value after all subtractions of `Min * Max` have been performed, and it remains unchanged after the loop.
