Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input, `t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `_` is a placeholder variable, `rep` is 60 or the loop condition is no longer met, `tab` is a list containing the string representations of `number` for each iteration, `i` is the last element in `tab` if `k` is 0, `Min` and `Max` are the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively, and `n` is the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integer values read from the input.
- The value of `t` is still greater than 0 and decremented by 1.
- The placeholder variable `_` remains unchanged.
- The value of `rep` is still 60 or the loop condition is no longer met.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representations of `number` for each iteration.
- If `k` is 0, `i` is still the last element in `tab`.
- `Min` and `Max` are still the last computed minimum and maximum values of `n // k` and `k` respectively.
- The value of `n` is still the final value after subtracting `Min * Max` for each iteration.
