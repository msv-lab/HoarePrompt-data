Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a non-zero integer and is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `rep` is 2, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` and the string representation of `number` appended to it, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`. If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, `number` is equal to `Min`, and `k` is updated to `k - Max`. Otherwise, `number` is equal to `Max`, and `k` is updated to `k - Min`.***
