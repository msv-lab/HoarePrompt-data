Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer, which is the result of the user's input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a line of user input, expecting a series of numbers separated by spaces, and returns a map object that converts these numbers into integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user input has been processed and is available as a map object of integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input string by spaces, converts each resulting substring into an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function affects the program by consuming user input and producing a list of integers.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and returns the input provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes the user's input as the return value.
Function number 5 :

def func_5():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of user input and returns a list of strings, where each string is a part of the input split by whitespace. The function does not modify any external variables or state.
