Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the inputs for each test case using `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. These functions are designed to handle the input format as specified in the problem description.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search loop is implemented correctly. The loop continues until `left + 1 == right`, and the midpoint `mid` is calculated correctly as `left + (right - left) // 2`. The program updates `left` or `right` based on the value of `p[mid]` compared to `x`.

3. **Tracking Seen Elements**: The `seen` list is used to track which elements in the permutation have been considered during the binary search. This is necessary to determine if the element `x` has been seen and to identify elements that need to be swapped to ensure the binary search works correctly.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If `p[left] == x`, the program correctly outputs `0` because no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not seen in the `seen` list, the program outputs `1` and the indices to swap `x` into the correct position.
   - If `x` is seen but not at the correct position, the program outputs `2` and performs the necessary swaps to place `x` correctly.

5. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program correctly identifies the indices to swap by using the `num_indx` dictionary, which maps each number to its index in the permutation.
   - The `temp` list is used to find the smallest index that has not been seen, which is then used to perform the swaps.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - The program also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position but can be moved there with one or two swaps.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program uses a binary search, which is efficient with a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
   - The additional operations for swapping are also efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) for the initial setup and \(O(n \log n)\) for sorting the `temp` list, which is acceptable given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
