You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/ac8986e55ddc41e4d0ee63ac67222f97e7fcc1bf.png)

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Example

Input

    7
    
    5 3
    
    4 1 1 4 4
    
    1 10
    
    7
    
    7 2
    
    4 2 1 100 5 2 3
    
    10 4
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5 2
    
    3 8 1 48 7
    
    6 2
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40
    
    6 3
    
    10 20 30 10 20 40

Output

    2
    1
    1
    3
    5
    1
    6
    
Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]
        if max(p) >= k:
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` and an integer `k`, along with a list `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function checks if any integer in the list `l` appears at least `k` times. If so, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `l` are not modified. The function does not return any value, but it produces a series of integer outputs, one for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations is flawed. The program simply checks if the maximum count of any number in the hand is greater than or equal to `k` and, if so, prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual number of cards that can be left after performing the operations optimally.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5 3
1 1 1 2 2
```
The expected output is `2` because you can exchange the three `1`s for two new cards, leaving you with `2` cards. However, the program will output `3 - 1 = 2` because the maximum count of any number is `3`, which is greater than or equal to `k`. This is a coincidence and does not reflect the correct logic for all cases.

A more accurate approach would involve calculating the minimum number of cards left by considering the counts of each number and how they can be reduced through the operations. The correct solution should take into account the possibility of reducing the count of each number by multiples of `k` and then summing the remaining counts to find the minimum number of cards left.
