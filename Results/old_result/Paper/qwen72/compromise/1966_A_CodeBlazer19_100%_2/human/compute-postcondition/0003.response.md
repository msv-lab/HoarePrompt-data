The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the context provided, it is implied that the function operates within a context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `c`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 100.
- `c` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100.

The function returns the result of processing these test cases, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the problem statement. 

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a list `c` of `n` integers. It returns the result of processing these test cases.**
