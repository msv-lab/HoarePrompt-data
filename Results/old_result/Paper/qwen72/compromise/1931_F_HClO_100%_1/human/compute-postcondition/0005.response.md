Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `n` and `m` are input integers.
- The current value of `m` is 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print('yes')
```

This code simply prints the string `'yes'`. The values of the variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `m` do not affect the output of this specific `print` statement because the string `'yes'` is hardcoded.

Output: **yes**
