Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is `m - 2`, and since `m` is 2, `_` is 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is equal to 2.
- `a1` is the first integer from the input.
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input.
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input.
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`.
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`.
- The loop has executed `m - 2` times, which is 0 times.
- `m - 2` input operations have occurred, which is 0 input operations.
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration.
- `val` is an empty list.
- `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.
- `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`.

Given these conditions, the `print('yes')` statement will simply print the string `'yes'`.

Output: **yes**
