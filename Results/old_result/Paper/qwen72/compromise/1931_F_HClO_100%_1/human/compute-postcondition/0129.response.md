Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from each new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input. If any `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, the loop breaks and prints 'no'. Otherwise, the loop completes and prints 'yes'.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each tuple `(a3, l3)` in the list `val`. The loop will execute `m - 2` times, as specified by the length of `val`.
- **Condition Check**: For each tuple `(a3, l3)`, the loop checks if `l3` is not equal to the list `[i for i in l if i != a3]`. If this condition is true for any tuple, the loop breaks and prints 'no'.
- **Completion**: If the loop completes without breaking (i.e., the condition is false for all tuples), it prints 'yes'.
- **Variable States**: All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `p1`, `p2`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
