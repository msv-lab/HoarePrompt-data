The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `_` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- `m` is greater than 2
- `a1` is the first integer from the input
- `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input
- `a2` is the first integer from the new input
- `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input
- `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`
- `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`
- `l11` is not equal to `l22`
- The loop has executed `m - 2` times
- `m - 2` input operations have occurred
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration
- `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`
- `a3` is the first integer from the third input
- `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the third input

After executing the code:
- `a3` is updated to the first integer from the new input
- `l3` is updated to a list of the remaining integers from the new input

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` and `p2` remain as they were before the last iteration, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, `a3` is the first integer from the new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input.**
