Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`. The elements at positions `i + p1` in list `l1` and `i + p2` in list `l2` are either not both equal to `a2` and `a1` respectively, or they are not equal to each other.***
