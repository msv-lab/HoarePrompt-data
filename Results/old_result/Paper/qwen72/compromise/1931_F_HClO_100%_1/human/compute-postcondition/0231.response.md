Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, and `val` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1` is greater than `idx2`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at index `n - 3`, and `l` is a reference to `l1`. If `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the first integer from the input and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the input. If the index of `a1` in `l3` is less than the index of `a2` in `l3`, `a1` is inserted into `l1` at position `n - 3`, and `l` is a reference to `l1`. Otherwise, `a2` is inserted into `l2` at index `n - 3`, and `l` is a reference to `l2`. In both cases, `m` is decreased by 1 if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`.***
