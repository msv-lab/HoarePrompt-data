The code `l1.insert(idx2, a1)` inserts the value of `a1` into the list `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `idx2` is either -1 or one of the values from 0 to `n-2`.
- If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is set to `n-2`.
- Otherwise, `idx2` remains unchanged.

### Case Analysis:
1. **If `idx2` is -1 and `idx1` is not -1:**
   - `idx2` is set to `n-2`.
   - `a1` is inserted into `l1` at position `n-2`.

2. **If `idx2` is not -1:**
   - `a1` is inserted into `l1` at the position specified by `idx2`.

### Updated State:
- `l1` is updated to include `a1` at the position `idx2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

### Output State:
**`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1 (if `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is now `n-2`), `val` is an empty list, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1` with `a1` inserted at position `idx2`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**
