Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is 0, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is `n - 2`:** The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 2` (inclusive), so after all iterations, `i` will be `n - 2`.
- **`p1` is either 0 or 1:** Depending on the conditions inside the loop, `p1` can be incremented by 1, but it will not exceed 1.
- **`p2` is either 0 or 1:** Similarly, `p2` can be incremented by 1, but it will not exceed 1.
- **`idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1:** `idx1` is set to the index where a specific condition is met, or it remains -1 if no such condition is met.
- **`idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1:** `idx2` is set to the index where a specific condition is met, or it remains -1 if no such condition is met.
- **Other variables (`val`, `l`, `m`, `a3`, `l3`, `_`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) remain unchanged:** These variables are not modified within the loop, so their values remain as they were in the initial state.
