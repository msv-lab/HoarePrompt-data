Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i` is 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation: The value of `idx2` is updated to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop (`i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`) is not affected by this change.
