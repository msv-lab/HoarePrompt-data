Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is 2, and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is 2, and `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally.***
