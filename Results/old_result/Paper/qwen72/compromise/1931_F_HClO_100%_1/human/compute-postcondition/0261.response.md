The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `l3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `_` is `m - 2`.**
