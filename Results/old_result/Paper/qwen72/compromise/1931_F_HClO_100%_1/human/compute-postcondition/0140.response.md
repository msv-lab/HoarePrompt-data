To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `m`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `_` is `m - 1`
- `m` is the new input integer greater than 2

For the loop `for _ in range(m - 2):` to execute, the range must contain at least one element. This means `m - 2` must be greater than 0, which implies `m` must be greater than 2.

Since `_` is `m - 1`, and `m` is already greater than 2, `_` will be at least 1 when the loop starts. However, the loop variable `_` is reassigned within the loop, so its initial value does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `m` is greater than 2, which is already given in the state. The loop will execute `m - 2` times, starting with `_` being 0 (the first value in the range).

State: **`_` is 0, `m` is greater than 2**
