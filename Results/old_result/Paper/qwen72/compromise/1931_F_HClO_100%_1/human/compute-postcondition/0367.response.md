Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is either 0 or 1, `p2` is either 0 or 1, `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1, `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1 (if `idx2` was -1 and `idx1` is not -1, `idx2` is now `n - 2`), `val` is a list containing the tuples `(a3, l3)` and any previous tuples it contained, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the new input line, `l3` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a3`, `_` is 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx2` if `idx1 > idx2`), `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2` (with `a2` inserted at position `idx1` if `idx1 < idx2`), `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, and `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.** 

Explanation:
- The code `a3, *l3 = map(int, input().split())` reads a new input line, splits it into parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns the first integer to `a3` and the rest to the list `l3`.
- All other variables (`i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `val`, `m`, `_`, `a1`, `a2`, `l1`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
