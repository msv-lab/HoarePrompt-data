The code snippet `val.append((a3, l3))` appends the tuple `(a3, l3)` to the list `val`. Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `i` remains `n - 2`.
- `p1` remains 1.
- `p2` remains 1.
- `idx1` remains `n - 3`.
- `val` was initially an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. After appending `(a3, l3)`, `val` will contain one or two instances of `(a3, l3)`.
- `idx2` remains `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions.
- `l` remains a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions.
- `m` remains greater than 2.
- `a3` remains the first integer from user input.
- `l3` remains a list of integers from the remaining user input.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing one or two tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining user input.**
