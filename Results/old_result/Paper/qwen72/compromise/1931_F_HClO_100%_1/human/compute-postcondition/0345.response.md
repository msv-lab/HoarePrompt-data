To determine what will be printed by the `print('yes')` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `i` is `n - 2`.
   - `p1` is either 0 or 1.
   - `p2` is either 0 or 1.
   - `idx1` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1.
   - `idx2` is either 0, 1, ..., `n-2`, or -1.
   - `val` is an empty list.
   - `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions.
   - `m` is equal to 2.
   - `a3` is undefined.
   - `l3` is undefined.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`.
   - `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`.
   - `a2` is the first integer from the new input line.
   - `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`.
   - `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`.
   - `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
   - `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2`.
   - `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - The condition `idx1` is greater than or equal to `idx2` and `idx1` is not greater than `idx2` implies that `idx1` must be equal to `idx2`.
   - The `print('yes')` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions mentioned above. It simply prints the string `'yes'`.

Given this analysis, the output of the `print('yes')` statement is straightforward:

Output: **yes**
