The code initializes an empty list named `val`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same for all other variables except that `val` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, `val` is an empty list.**
