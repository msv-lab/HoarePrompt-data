Postcondition: ***`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, and `val` is an empty list or a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`. If `idx1 < idx2`, `idx2` is `n - 2`, `l` is a reference to `l2` which has `a2` inserted at index `n - 3`. If `idx1` is not less than `idx2`, `idx2` is `n - 3`, and `l` is a reference to either `l1` (with `a1` inserted at index `n - 3`) or `l2` (with `a2` inserted at index `n - 3`). In the latter case, if `idx1` is not greater than `idx2`, `val` is a list containing the tuple `(a3, l3)`, and `m` is decreased by 1.***
