Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `idx2` is `n - 3`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n - 1` times, starting with `i` initialized to 0 and incrementing by 1 each iteration.
- The loop condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` ensures that the loop will terminate when `i` reaches `n - 2` because `max(p1, p2)` is 1 (as both `p1` and `p2` are set to 1 during the loop).
- During the loop, if `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the program checks specific conditions:
  - If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, the loop breaks.
  - If `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1.
  - If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1.
  - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the loop breaks.
- Since the loop iterates `n - 1` times, and `p1` and `p2` are both set to 1, the final value of `i` will be `n - 2`.
- The indices `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `n - 3` because the loop breaks when both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, which happens at the second-to-last iteration (`i = n - 3`).

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is as described.
