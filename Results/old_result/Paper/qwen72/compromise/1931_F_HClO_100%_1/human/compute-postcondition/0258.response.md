The code snippet `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 2`
- `p1` is 1
- `p2` is 1
- `idx1` is `n - 3`
- `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`
- `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions
- `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions
- `m` is greater than 2
- `a3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`)
- `l3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`)
- `_` is `m - 2`

After executing the code snippet:
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `m` is assigned the second integer from the input.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged, except for `m` which now holds the new value from the input.

Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `l3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `_` is `m - 2`.**
