Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `a3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `l3` is undefined (as there are no more tuples in `val`), `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. One line of input has been consumed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: One more line of input has been consumed. `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is `m - 1`, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. Two lines of input have been consumed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: One more line of input has been consumed. `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing 0 tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` must be greater than 2, `a3` is undefined, `l3` is undefined, `_` is `m - 2`, `a1` is the first integer from the input line after `n` and `m`, `l1` is a list of integers from the input line after `a1`, `a2` is the first integer from the new input line, `l2` is a list of integers from the new input line after `a2`, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding `a1`. Three lines of input have been consumed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
