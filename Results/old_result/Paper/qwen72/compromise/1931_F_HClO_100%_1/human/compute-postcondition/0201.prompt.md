Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0 but less than its previous value, `_` is `m - 1`, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `m` is the new input integer greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 1` times, `m - 1` input operations have occurred, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `val` is a list containing `m - 1` tuples, each tuple being `(a3, l3)` where `a3` is the first integer from each new input, and `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from each new input. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `_` is updated to `m - 2`, `m` remains greater than 2, and the program waits for user input, skipping the current iteration of the loop. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum value between `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then: if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the elements at positions `i + p1` in list `l1` and `i + p2` in list `l2` are either not both equal to `a2` and `a1` respectively, or they are not equal to each other. If the element at position `i + p1` in list `l1` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is 0 and `p1` is 1. Otherwise, the element at position `i + p1` in list `l1` is not equal to `a2`, `idx2` is 0, and `p2` is 1. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, and `l1[i + p1] == a2`, then `p1` is 1 and `idx1` is 1, and the program continues execution normally unless `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. If `idx1 < 0` or `idx2 < 0`, the program continues execution normally. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, and `l1[i + p1] != a2`, then `idx2` is 1, `p2` is 1, and if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, the program continues execution normally.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is 2, and `p1` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is 2, and `p2` is 1. If `idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
