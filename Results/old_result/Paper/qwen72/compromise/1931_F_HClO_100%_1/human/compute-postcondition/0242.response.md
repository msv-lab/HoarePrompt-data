Output State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 1, `idx1` is `n - 3`, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, `idx2` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` depending on the conditions, `l` is a reference to `l1` or `l2` depending on the conditions, `m` is greater than 2, `a3` is the first integer from the last user input, `l3` is a list of integers from the remaining parts of the last user input, `_` is `m - 3`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop runs `m - 2` times, so after all iterations, the variable `_` will be `m - 3`.
- The list `val` will contain `m - 2` tuples `(a3, l3)`, each corresponding to the user inputs received during each iteration.
- The variables `i`, `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, `idx2`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The conditions for `idx2` and `l` remain the same as described in the initial state.
- The values of `a3` and `l3` in the final state correspond to the last user input received during the last iteration of the loop.
