Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` and `m` are input integers where `m` must be greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, and `m - 2` input operations have occurred, the loop continues to the next iteration, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, and `m - 2` input operations have occurred. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, and if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, the loop breaks out of the current iteration, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, if the element at index `i + p1` in `l1` is equal to `a2`, then `idx1` is `i` (which is 0), `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, and `p2` is 0, and if both `idx1` and `idx2` are greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If none of these conditions are met, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, and `p2` is 1. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` is equal to `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing as usual.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, then `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2` and `l2[i + p2] != a1`, then `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0. If `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `m - 2`, `n` is greater than 3, `m` is greater than 2, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing elements from `l1` excluding any occurrences of `a2`, `l22` is a list containing elements from `l2` excluding any occurrences of `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, the loop has executed `m - 2` times, `m - 2` input operations have occurred, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, then: (1) If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. (2) Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 2, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. (3) If neither condition is met, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain as they were before the if statement. If `l1[i + p1] == l2[i + p2]`, the values of `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain as they were before the if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
