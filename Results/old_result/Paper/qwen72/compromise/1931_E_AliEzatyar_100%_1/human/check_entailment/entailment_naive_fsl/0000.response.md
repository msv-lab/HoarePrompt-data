Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is used to count trailing zeros in the string representation of the numbers, but the game rules do not mention anything about trailing zeros. The game rules only specify that Anna reverses the digits of a chosen number, and Sasha concatenates two numbers in any order. The program incorrectly uses the count of trailing zeros to determine the winner, which does not align with the game rules.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the problem description, Anna can reverse either 14 (to 41) or 2 (to 2). If Anna reverses 14 to 41, Sasha can concatenate 41 and 2 to get 412, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\). If Anna reverses 2 to 2, Sasha can concatenate 2 and 14 to get 214, which is also greater than \(10^2 = 100\). In both cases, Sasha wins.

However, the program in the given code does not correctly simulate this logic. It incorrectly uses the count of trailing zeros, which is irrelevant to the game rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
