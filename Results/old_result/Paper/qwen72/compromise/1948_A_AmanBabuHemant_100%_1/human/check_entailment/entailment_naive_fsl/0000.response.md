Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is 2 correctly. According to the problem description, for `n = 2`, there should be a string with exactly 2 special characters. The program generates a string `s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)`, which for `n = 2` results in `s = 'AAB'`. However, the string 'AAB' has 3 special characters (positions 1, 2, and 3), not 2. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for this specific case.
