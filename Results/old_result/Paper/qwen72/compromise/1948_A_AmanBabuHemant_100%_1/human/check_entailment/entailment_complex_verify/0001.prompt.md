You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = 'AAB' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is the last input integer provided during the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 50`, and then for each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` from the input, where `1 <= n <= 50`. For each `n`, if `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even and the length of the string `'AAB' * (n // 2)` is less than 200, it prints 'YES' followed by the string. If the length of the string is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is the last input integer provided during the loop execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` which represents the number of special characters required in the string.

2. **Special Character Condition:**
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters where each special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is because special characters must come in pairs (e.g., AA, BB, etc.).

3. **String Construction:**
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern 'AAB' repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that each 'A' is a special character because it is equal to its neighbor 'A', and each 'B' is not a special character because it is not equal to its neighbors.
   - The length of the string `s` is `3 * (n // 2)`, which is always less than or equal to 200 for the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

4. **Output:**
   - If the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200, the program prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length of the string `s` exceeds 200, the program prints 'NO'. However, given the constraints, this condition will never be true because the maximum length of `s` is `3 * 25 = 75`, which is well within the limit of 200.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, checks the conditions, and constructs the string as required. It also ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is always true given the constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
