Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then, for each test case, reads the integer `n`.

2. **Odd `n` Handling**: The function correctly identifies that if `n` is odd, it is impossible to construct a string with exactly `n` special characters. This is because each special character must be part of a pair (either "AA" or "BB"), and an odd number of special characters cannot be formed by pairs. Therefore, printing 'NO' in this case is correct.

3. **Even `n` Handling**: For even `n`, the function constructs a string `s` using the pattern `'AAB' * (n // 2)`. This pattern ensures that each "A" in "AAB" is a special character because it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors (the "A" to its left or right). The string `s` will have exactly `n` special characters.

4. **String Length Check**: The function checks if the length of the string `s` is less than 200. If it is, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`. If the length is 200 or more, it prints 'NO'. This is necessary because the problem specifies that the string length should be at most 200.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For `n = 6`, the string `'AAB' * (6 // 2) = 'AAB' * 3 = 'AABAABAAB'` is generated, which has exactly 6 special characters (positions 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8). The length of the string is 9, which is less than 200, so the output is correct.
   - For `n = 1`, the function correctly prints 'NO' because 1 is odd.
   - For `n = 2`, the string `'AAB' * (2 // 2) = 'AAB' * 1 = 'AAB'` is generated, which has exactly 2 special characters (positions 1 and 3). The length of the string is 3, which is less than 200, so the output is correct.

6. **Edge Case**: The function also correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 50. The string `'AAB' * (50 // 2) = 'AAB' * 25` would have a length of 75, which is still less than 200, so it would print 'YES' followed by the string.

Given the above reasoning, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description and handles all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
