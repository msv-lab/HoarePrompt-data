The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is intended to be used in a context where `t` and `n` are integers, with `1 <= t <= 50` and `1 <= n <= 50` for each test case. Since the function body is not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can infer that the function is designed to perform some operation or return some value based on these constraints.

Given the lack of explicit parameters and the output details, we can only describe the general context in which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function operates in a context where `t` and `n` are integers within the range 1 to 50. It is designed to perform some operation or return a value based on these constraints.**
