The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` is irrelevant to the loop's execution, and the value of `_` is not used within the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50 for each test case, `_` is not used, `t` must be greater than 0**
