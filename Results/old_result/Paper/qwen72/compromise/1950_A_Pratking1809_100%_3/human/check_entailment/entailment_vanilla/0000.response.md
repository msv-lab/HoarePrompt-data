Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description.
   
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `q` times, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers. This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is the correct condition for a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This is the correct condition for a peak.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback for the given problem.

5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case, which is consistent with the problem's output format.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), it will print "NONE" because neither a stair nor a peak can be formed.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
