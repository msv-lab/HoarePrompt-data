Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `q` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description. The input is correctly converted to an integer using `int(input())`.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `q` times, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases. The loop variable `i` is not used, which is fine as it is not needed for the logic.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and `map(int, ...)` to convert them to integers. This is correct and matches the problem's input format. The `split()` method ensures that the input is split into three parts, and `map(int, ...)` converts these parts into integers.

4. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This is the correct condition for a stair.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This is the correct condition for a peak.
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback for the given problem.

5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case, which is consistent with the problem's output format. The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected output for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), it will print "NONE" because neither a stair nor a peak can be formed. Other edge cases, such as `a == b` or `b == c`, are also correctly handled by the program, as they do not satisfy the conditions for a stair or a peak.

7. **State Management**: The annotated version confirms that the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated for each test case, and the loop prints the correct result based on the conditions. The final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the loop are the last input values provided by the user, which is expected behavior.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all specified cases, including edge cases.

Final: **True**
