The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases is determined by user input. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it only performs these print actions based on the conditions. After processing all test cases, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are the last input values provided by the user.
