Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n-2`.
   - `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement uses string formatting to print `2` followed by the value of `i`.
   - The `*range(1, n + 1)` part will unpack the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print each element separated by spaces.

4. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `i` is `n-2`, the value of `i` will be `n-2`.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`.

5. **Construct the Output:**
   - The string `'2 %d' % i` will be formatted to `2 [n-2]`.
   - The unpacked range will be the numbers from 1 to `n`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `2 [n-2]` followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 [n-2] 1 2 ... n (where [n-2] is the value of `n-2` and `n` is the value of `n`)**
