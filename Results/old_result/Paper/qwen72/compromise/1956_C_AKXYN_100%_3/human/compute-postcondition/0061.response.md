Let's break down the code step by step based on the initial state:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is: `print('2 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))`.
   - The first part of the `print` statement is a formatted string: `'2 %d' % i`.
     - `%d` is a placeholder for an integer.
     - `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - The second part of the `print` statement is `*range(1, n + 1)`.
     - `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
     - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence into individual arguments for the `print` function.

3. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `i` is `n - 1`, the formatted string will be `'2 %d' % (n - 1)`.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will first print the string `'2 %d' % (n - 1)`, which evaluates to `'2 [n-1]'`.
   - Then, it will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Output: **2 [n-1] 1 2 ... n (where [n-1] is the value of `n - 1` and `n` is the value of `n`)**
