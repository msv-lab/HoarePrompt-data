Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains the same as it was in the initial state because it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `i` will be `n-1` after the loop has completed all its iterations. This is because the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`, and the last value of `i` will be `n-1`.
- The variable `res` will be the sum of the expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all values of `i` from 0 to `n-1`. This means that `res` will be the sum of the results of this expression for each iteration of the loop.
