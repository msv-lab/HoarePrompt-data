Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `res` is 1, `mat` is a list of `n` lists, where each list contains integers from 1 to `n`**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `res += (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` updates the value of `res`.
- Initially, `i` is 0 and `res` is 0.
- The expression `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (2 * 0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `1 * 1 = 1`.
- Therefore, `res` is updated to `0 + 1 = 1`.
- The values of `n` and `mat` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet.
