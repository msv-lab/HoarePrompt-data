The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop's execution depends on the range, which is determined by the input. The input is expected to be an integer representing the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `t` must be an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
