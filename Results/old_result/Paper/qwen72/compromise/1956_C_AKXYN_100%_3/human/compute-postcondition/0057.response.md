Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is set to `n`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('1 %d' % i, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is using a format string `'1 %d' % i` where `%d` is a placeholder for an integer. The value of `i` is substituted into this placeholder.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` is using the unpacking operator `*` to unpack the range of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and print them as separate arguments.

4. **Values**:
   - Since `i` is set to `n`, the format string `'1 %d' % i` will print `1 n`.
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

5. **Final Output**:
   - The `print` statement will first print `1 n` followed by the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

Output: **1 n 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n)**
