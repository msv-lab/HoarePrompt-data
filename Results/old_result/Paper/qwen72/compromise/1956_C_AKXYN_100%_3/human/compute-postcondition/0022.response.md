The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute a number of times determined by the value returned by `int(input())`. The variable `_` is a dummy variable that is not used within the loop, and `int(input())` is evaluated at the start of each iteration of the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` remains unchanged
- `i` is 0
- `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`

Since the loop head does not reference `n`, `i`, or `res` directly, and the loop control is based on the input provided by `int(input())`, the only state that can be adjusted is the number of remaining iterations, which is determined by the input value.

However, since the input value is not part of the state provided and is not stored in a variable, we cannot modify it directly. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, because the loop head does not change the values of `n`, `i`, or `res`.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `res` is the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`**
