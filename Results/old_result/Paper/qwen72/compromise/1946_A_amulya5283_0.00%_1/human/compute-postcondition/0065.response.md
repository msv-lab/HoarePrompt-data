Output State: **The loop has completed all its iterations, `heap[0]` is now greater than `current_median`, `heap` has the same number of elements as before the loop started, and `operations` has been incremented by the number of times the loop executed.**

In natural language, this means that after all the iterations of the loop, the smallest element in the heap (`heap[0]`) is now greater than the `current_median`. The heap still contains the same number of elements as it did when the loop started, but each element that was originally less than or equal to `current_median` has been incremented by 1 multiple times until the smallest element in the heap is greater than `current_median`. The `operations` variable, which tracks the number of times the loop has executed, has been incremented by the total number of iterations the loop went through.
