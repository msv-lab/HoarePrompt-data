Output State: **`heap[0]` is now the next smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is equal to the previous `heap[0]`, `heap` has one fewer element than before the execution of the code, `operations` is increased by 2, and `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `arr[median_index] + 2`**

Explanation:
- `smallest` is assigned the value of the smallest element in the heap, which was previously `heap[0]`.
- `heap[0]` is now the next smallest element in the heap after the smallest element has been removed.
- The `heap` has one fewer element than before the execution of the code.
- The value of `operations` is increased by 2, as stated in the initial state.
- The condition that `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `arr[median_index] + 2` remains unchanged.
