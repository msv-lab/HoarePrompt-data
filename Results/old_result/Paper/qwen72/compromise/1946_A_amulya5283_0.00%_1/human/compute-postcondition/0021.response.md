Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[0]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[0]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]`, `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements that were initially smaller than or equal to `current_median` have been incremented by 1, and `operations` is the number of elements in the heap that were initially smaller than or equal to `current_median`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `heap` will still contain the elements starting from the `median_index` to the end of the sorted `arr`, but any element that was initially smaller than or equal to `current_median` will have been incremented by 1. The `operations` variable will hold the count of how many such elements were incremented. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `arr`, `median_index`, and `current_median`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
