Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case by sorting the list of integers, calculating the median, and then performing operations to ensure all elements in the list are greater than the median. It returns a list `results` containing the number of operations required for each test case. After the function concludes, `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of operations needed for the corresponding test case. The input variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. **
