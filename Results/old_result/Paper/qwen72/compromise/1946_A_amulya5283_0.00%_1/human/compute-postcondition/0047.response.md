The code snippet `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. This impacts the variable `arr` but does not change the values of other variables. The specific values of `t`, `i`, `results`, `n`, `median_index`, `current_median`, `heap`, and `operations` remain the same. However, the sorted `arr` will now have its elements in ascending order, which may affect the value of `current_median` if it was based on the unsorted `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 2, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `n` is the first element of `test_cases[2]`, `arr` is the second element of `test_cases[2]` and is now sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is `n // 2`, `current_median` is `arr[median_index]` (updated to the new median after sorting), `heap` is a heap (min-heap) containing the elements of `arr` starting from the `median_index` to the end, but all elements in the heap are now greater than `current_median`, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed.**
