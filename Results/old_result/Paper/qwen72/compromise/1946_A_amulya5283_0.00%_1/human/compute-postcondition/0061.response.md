The variables in the loop head are `heap[0]` and `current_median`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `heap[0] <= current_median`. At the end of the last iteration, `heap[0]` is now the smallest element in the heap, and `smallest` is equal to `arr[median_index] + 1`. The new smallest element in the heap is `smallest + 1`, which means `heap[0]` is `arr[median_index] + 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `heap[0]` must be less than or equal to `current_median`. Since `heap[0]` is `arr[median_index] + 2`, `current_median` must be at least `arr[median_index] + 2` for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`heap[0]` is now the smallest element in the heap, `smallest` is equal to `arr[median_index] + 1`, `heap` has the same number of elements as before the execution of the code, `operations` is increased by 2, and `current_median` must be greater than or equal to `arr[median_index] + 2`**
