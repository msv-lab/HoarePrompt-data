The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list. The function returns 'NO' in some cases and 'YES' in others. To determine the specific conditions for each return value, we consider the following:

- **Case_1**: If the sum of the integers in `nums` is not divisible by the length of `nums`, the function returns 'NO'.
- **Case_2**: If the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by the length of `nums`, the function returns 'YES'.

However, since the parameter constraint already specifies that the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by the length of the list, the function will always return 'YES'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` where the sum of the integers is divisible by the length of the list, and it returns 'YES'.**
