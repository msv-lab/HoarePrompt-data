Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation**: The program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. While the problem description guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, the check `if total % n != 0` is still included. However, this check is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

3. **Water Distribution Check**: The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`). It then iterates through the list `nums` and keeps a running total of the difference between the current amount of water in each container and the mean. If at any point this running total (`curr`) becomes negative, it returns 'NO'. This is the correct approach because if `curr` becomes negative, it means that at some point, the cumulative amount of water in the first `i` containers is less than the cumulative mean, which implies that it is impossible to balance the water by pouring from the first `i` containers to the remaining containers.

4. **Correct Logic**: The logic in the function `func_1` is correct. If `curr` remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it means that the cumulative amount of water in the first `i` containers is always at least the cumulative mean, and thus it is always possible to balance the water by pouring from containers with more water to containers with less water, as required by the problem.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs 'YES' if it is possible to balance the water and 'NO' if it is not.

Given the above points, the program's logic is sound and it correctly handles all potential cases as described in the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
