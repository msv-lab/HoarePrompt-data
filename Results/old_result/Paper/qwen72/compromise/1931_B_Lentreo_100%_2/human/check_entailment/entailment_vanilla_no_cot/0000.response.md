Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. Here are the issues:

1. **Redundant Check for Total Divisibility by n:**
   - The problem description guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. Therefore, the check `if total % n != 0` is unnecessary and will never be true. This check can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Pouring Water:**
   - The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. The variable `curr` is used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean amount of water. However, this approach does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - The correct approach is to check if the maximum amount of water in any container is less than or equal to the mean amount of water. If any container has more water than the mean, it is impossible to distribute the water such that all containers have the same amount.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    print(func_1(nums))

def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    mean = total // n
    for num in nums:
        if num > mean:
            return 'NO'
    return 'YES'
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
  - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - It calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have.
  - It iterates through the list of water amounts and checks if any container has more water than the mean.
  - If any container has more water than the mean, it returns 'NO' because it is impossible to distribute the water such that all containers have the same amount.
  - If no container has more water than the mean, it returns 'YES'.

This corrected program should correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.
