You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a list of test cases, where each test case is a list of four tuples, each tuple containing two integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000, and the number of test cases t satisfies 1 <= t <= 100. The coordinates are guaranteed to form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.

    #State: The loop will print the area of each square provided in the test cases, calculated as the square of the side length. The variable `a` will remain unchanged, and the loop will have iterated `a` times. The variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x3`, `y3`, `x4`, `y4`, and `res` will have their final values based on the last iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases for the given problem. Specifically, the program assumes a fixed order of the coordinates being input, which is not guaranteed by the problem description. The problem states that the coordinates of the corners are given in random order, but the program only checks a few specific permutations of these coordinates. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
The program will not correctly compute the area because it does not account for the possibility that the coordinates might not match the specific conditions it checks (i.e., `x1 == x3 and x2 == x4`, `x1 == x2 and x3 == x4`, or `x1 == x4 and x3 == x2`). A correct solution would need to identify the side length of the square regardless of the order of the input coordinates.
