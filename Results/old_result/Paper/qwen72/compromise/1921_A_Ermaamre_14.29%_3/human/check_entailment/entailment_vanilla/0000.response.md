### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates, representing the corners of the square.

2. **Coordinate Comparison:**
   - The program checks the coordinates to determine the side length of the square.
   - It uses a series of `if` statements to compare the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points to find the side length.

3. **Side Length Calculation:**
   - The program assumes that the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, which means that two pairs of coordinates will have the same x-coordinates and the other two pairs will have the same y-coordinates.
   - It calculates the side length by taking the absolute difference between the y-coordinates of the points that share the same x-coordinate.

4. **Area Calculation:**
   - The area of the square is calculated by squaring the side length.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Handling:**
   - The program only checks for specific pairs of coordinates to determine the side length. However, the coordinates are given in a random order, and the program does not handle all possible permutations of the coordinates.
   - For example, if the coordinates are given as:
     ```
     1 2
     4 5
     1 5
     4 2
     ```
     The program will correctly identify the side length as 3 and the area as 9.
   - However, if the coordinates are given as:
     ```
     1 2
     1 5
     4 2
     4 5
     ```
     The program will not correctly identify the side length because it only checks specific pairs of coordinates.

2. **General Solution:**
   - To correctly handle all possible permutations of the coordinates, the program should sort the coordinates and then calculate the side length based on the sorted values.
   - Alternatively, it can find the minimum and maximum x-coordinates and y-coordinates and use the differences to determine the side length.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for j in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Sort points by x-coordinate
        points.sort(key=lambda p: p[0])
        
        # The side length can be determined by the difference in x or y coordinates
        # of the points with the same y or x coordinates, respectively.
        side_length = abs(points[0][0] - points[1][0])
        
        # Verify by checking the y-coordinates
        if abs(points[0][1] - points[2][1]) != side_length:
            side_length = abs(points[0][1] - points[2][1])
        
        print(side_length ** 2)
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it does not handle all possible permutations of the coordinates and may fail to correctly identify the side length of the square.

Correctness: **False**
