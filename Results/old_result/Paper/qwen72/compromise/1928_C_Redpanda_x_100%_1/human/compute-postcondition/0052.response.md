Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 < n <= 10^9. It computes the prime factorization of `n` and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n` (with each factor appearing as many times as its highest power in the factorization). The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective highest powers, and the generator yields all the prime factors. **
