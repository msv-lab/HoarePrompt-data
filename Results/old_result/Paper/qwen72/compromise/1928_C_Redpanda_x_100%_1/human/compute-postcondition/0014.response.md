Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, `_` is 2, and the generator is paused at the yield statement.**
