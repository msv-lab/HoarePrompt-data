The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `_` is less than `factors[prime] + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `factors[prime]` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `factors[prime]` must still be at least 1.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * prime`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, `_` is 2**
