Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the next element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factors[prime]` is a non-negative integer, and a value `factor * 1` has been yielded.** 

In this state, the value of `factor * prime_to_i` (which is `factor * 1` or simply `factor`) is yielded, and all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
