Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `primes` is a list of prime numbers, `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `factor` is the first element of `rest`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime * 1`, `factors[prime]` must be at least 1, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, `_` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `yield factor * prime_to_i` yields the value of `factor * prime_to_i`. Since this value has already been mentioned in the initial state as being yielded, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The only impact is that the value `factor * prime_to_i` is yielded, which is already part of the initial state. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
