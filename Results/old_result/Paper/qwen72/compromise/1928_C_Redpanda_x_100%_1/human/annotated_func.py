#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 < n <= 10^9. It computes the prime factorization of `n` and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n` (with each factor appearing as many times as its highest power in the factorization). The final state of the program is that `n` remains unchanged, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective highest powers, and the generator yields all the prime factors.

    #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where `primes` is a list of prime numbers. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and the loop has yielded all values of the form `factor * primes[k]^i` for each `factor` in `rest` and for `i` ranging from 0 to `factors[prime]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate(k)` is a generator that yields all possible products of the first `k` prime numbers in the list `primes`, where each prime number can appear in the product up to a specified number of times defined by the `factors` dictionary. If `k` is equal to the length of `primes`, the function yields 1. Otherwise, it yields all values of the form `factor * primes[k]^i` for each `factor` in the result of `generate(k + 1)` and for `i` ranging from 0 to `factors[primes[k]]`. The function does not return a list; it generates and yields values.
