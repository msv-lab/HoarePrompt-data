### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(n):**
     - This function computes the prime factorization of \( n \) and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of \( n \).
     - It is used to find all divisors of \( h \) (where \( h \) is either \( n - x \) or \( n + x - 2 \)).

   - **generate(k):**
     - This function is a recursive generator that yields all possible products of the prime factors up to their respective powers.
     - It is used to generate all divisors of \( h \) based on the prime factorization computed by `func_1`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - For each test case, the main logic computes \( h = n - x \) and \( h = n + x - 2 \).
   - It then uses `func_1` to find all divisors of \( h \) and filters them to find valid \( k \) values.
   - A valid \( k \) must satisfy:
     - \( k \) is even.
     - \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \geq x \).

4. **Validation:**
   - The main logic correctly identifies the two possible values of \( h \) (i.e., \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \)).
   - It uses the prime factorization to generate all divisors of \( h \) and filters them to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The conditions for valid \( k \) are correctly checked.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( x = 1 \) by not considering \( n + x - 2 \) in that case.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where no valid \( k \) exists (e.g., \( n = 100 \) and \( x = 99 \)).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the possible values of \( k \) based on the given constraints and handles edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
