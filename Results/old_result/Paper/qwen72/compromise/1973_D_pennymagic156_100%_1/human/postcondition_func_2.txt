The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input by whitespace, converts each split part into an integer, and returns an iterator that yields these integer values. After the function concludes, the caller will have an iterator that can be used to iterate over the integers derived from the user's input.
