Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2.
   - `k` must be a positive integer greater than 2.
   - `cnt` is `k - 2`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
   - `func_2()` must be less than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.
   - `l` is defined as `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` must be less than `n`, let's denote the value of `func_2()` as `f`. Therefore, `l = f + 1`.
   - `i * v` involves a variable `v` which is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We need to assume that `v` is a known value or can be derived from the context.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `? {l} {i * v}`.
   - Substituting the known values:
     - `i` is 2.
     - `l` is `f + 1` where `f` is the value returned by `func_2()`.
     - `i * v` is `2 * v` where `v` is a known or derivable value.

Since `v` is not explicitly defined, we will represent it as `v` in the output.

Output: **? [f + 1] [2 * v] (where f is the value returned by func_2() and v is a known or derivable value)**
