Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (where `func_2()` is less than `n`), and `v` is the last value of `i * v` printed before the loop exits.**

### Explanation:
- **`i` is 0**: The loop iterates from `1` to `n // k`. After completing all iterations, `i` will be incremented to the point where it no longer satisfies the loop condition (`i > 0`), so `i` will be `0`.
- **`n` remains unchanged**: The variable `n` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains the same as it was initially.
- **`k` remains unchanged**: Similarly, `k` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains the same as it was initially.
- **`cnt` is 0**: The inner `while` loop decrements `cnt` until it reaches `0`. Since the loop continues to run until `cnt` is `0`, this condition will always be true at the end of each iteration.
- **`l` is `func_2() + 1`**: The variable `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1` within the inner `while` loop. Since the loop continues to run until `cnt` is `0`, `l` will be the result of the last call to `func_2() + 1`.
- **`v` is the last value of `i * v` printed before the loop exits**: The value of `v` is set to `i * v` when the inner loop completes and the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is met. This value is then used in the final print statement before the function returns. Therefore, `v` will be the last value of `i * v` that was printed before the loop exits.
