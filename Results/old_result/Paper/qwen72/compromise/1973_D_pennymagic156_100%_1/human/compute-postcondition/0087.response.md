Functionality: ** The function `func_5` interacts with external functions `func_2` and `func_3` to perform a series of queries and operations. It does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The function initializes `n` and `k` using `func_3`, and then iterates through a loop to find a specific value `v`. If a certain condition is met, it performs additional queries and prints a result. If the conditions are not met, it prints `-1`. Throughout its execution, the function prints formatted strings to the console and calls `func_2` multiple times. The final state of the program includes the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, and the printed output based on the logic executed. **
