To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

```python
while cnt and l < n + 1:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition 1: `cnt`**
   - The variable `cnt` must be truthy for the loop to execute. In Python, any non-zero integer is considered truthy.
   - Given that `cnt` is initialized to `k` and `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is already truthy.

2. **Condition 2: `l < n + 1`**
   - The variable `l` must be less than `n + 1` for the loop to execute.
   - Given that `l` is 1, the condition `l < n + 1` simplifies to `1 < n + 1`, which is always true as long as `n` is a non-negative integer.

### Conclusion:
- Since `cnt` is already truthy (as `k` is a positive integer), no adjustment is needed for `cnt`.
- The condition `l < n + 1` is satisfied because `l` is 1 and `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, which implies `n` is at least 2 (since `k` is a positive integer).

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is `k`, `l` is 1, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`**
