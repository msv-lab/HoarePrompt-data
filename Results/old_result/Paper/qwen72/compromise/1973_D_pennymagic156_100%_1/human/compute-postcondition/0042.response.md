To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given state and the loop condition:

### Given State:
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 1
- `k` must be a positive integer
- `cnt` is 0
- `l` is `func_2() + 1` (where `func_2()` is less than `n`)
- Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`

### Loop Condition:
```python
for i in range(1, n // k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n // k`.
2. **Current State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.
3. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
4. **Condition Check**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n // k + 1`.

### Adjustments:
- **Increment `i`**: Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration.
- **Check `n // k`**: The value of `n // k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute one more time (since `i` will be 2).

### Final State:
- `i` is 2
- `n // k` must be at least 2
- All other variables (`k`, `cnt`, `l`) remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

### Conclusion:
State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1` (where `func_2()` is less than `n`). Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**
