Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3, `k` must be a positive integer and greater than 2, `cnt` is `k - 2`, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1`, `func_2()` must be less than `n`, and either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.**

Explanation: The code `l = func_2() + 1` updates the value of `l` to be `func_2() + 1`. Since `l` was already defined as `func_2() + 1` in the initial state, the value of `l` remains unchanged. All other conditions and variable values remain the same as they were in the initial state.
