To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, where `k` is a positive integer.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
- `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
- `func_2()` must be less than `n`.
- `cnt` is currently 0.
- `l` is currently equal to `n + 1`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

2. **Variable `v`:**
   - The variable `v` is not mentioned in the initial state. Since it is used in the `print` statement, we need to assume that `v` is defined elsewhere in the code. However, without additional context, we cannot determine its exact value.

3. **Expression `i * v`:**
   - The expression `i * v` will be evaluated as `2 * v` because `i` is 2.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(f'! {i * v}', flush=True)
```

### Output:
- The `print` statement will output the string `! ` followed by the value of `2 * v`.
- Since `v` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output will include the placeholder `v`.

Output: **! 2 * v (where v is the value of the variable v)**
