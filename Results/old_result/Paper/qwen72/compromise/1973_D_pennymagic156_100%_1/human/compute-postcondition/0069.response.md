Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 3.
   - `k` must be a positive integer.
   - `cnt` is `k - 1`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`.
   - `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.
   - `func_2()` must be less than `n`.
   - Either `cnt` is not 0 or `l` is not equal to `n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(f'? {l} {i * v}', flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`. Since `func_2()` must be less than `n`, let's denote `func_2()` as `f`. Therefore, `l = f + 1`.
   - `i * v` involves a variable `v` which is not explicitly defined in the initial state. We need to assume that `v` is a known value or can be determined from the context.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output a string in the format `? {l} {i * v}`.
   - `l` is `func_2() + 1`, where `func_2()` is some value `f` such that `f < n`.
   - `i * v` is `3 * v`, where `v` is an unknown but assumed to be a known value.

Given the constraints and the initial state, the most precise description of the output is:

Output: **? [func_2() + 1] [3 * v] (where func_2() is a value less than n and v is a known value)**

This output reflects the structure of the print statement and the values derived from the initial state.
