Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be such that `n // k` is at least 2, `k` must be a positive integer, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `func_2() + 1`, `l` is not equal to `n + 1` and `func_2()` must be less than `n`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`.
- After each iteration, `cnt` is decremented by 1, and `l` is updated to `func_2() + 1`.
- The loop will stop when `cnt` reaches 0 or when `l` becomes equal to `n + 1`.
- Since `cnt` starts at `k` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, after `k` iterations, `cnt` will be 0.
- The value of `l` after the loop finishes will be `func_2() + 1`, and it must still be less than `n + 1` for the loop to have completed without breaking early.
- The conditions on `i`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
