Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k > 1` and the array cannot be split into `k` subarrays with the same value of `m`. Specifically, the logic in the second loop where it tries to find the subarrays with the same value of `m` is flawed. It assumes that the subarrays can always be found, but this is not necessarily true for all inputs. For example, consider the case where `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and the hidden array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program may incorrectly conclude that a valid split exists when it does not. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
