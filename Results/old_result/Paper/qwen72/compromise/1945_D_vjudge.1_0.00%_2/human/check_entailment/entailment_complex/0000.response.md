### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function reads `n` and `k` from input, where `1 <= k <= n <= 200,000`.
   - It then reads two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`, each containing integers in the range `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9`.
   - Both lists are reversed to facilitate processing from the end of the queue to the front.
   - The function initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists:
     - If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it adds `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - After the loop, `soma_b` contains the sum of the elements in `lista_B` from index `n-k` to `n-1` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`.
   - The function then initializes `resultado` to infinity and iterates through the remaining elements (from `n-k` to `n-1`):
     - It updates `resultado` to the minimum of `resultado` and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
     - It adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - Finally, it prints `resultado`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads `numero_testes` from input, where `1 <= numero_testes <= 10^4`.
   - It calls `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times.
   - This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

### Analysis:
- **Reversing the Lists**: Reversing the lists allows the function to process the queue from the end (where Kirill starts) to the front (where he wants to be). This is a valid approach because the problem involves Kirill moving forward in the queue.
- **Initial Loop (0 to n-k-1)**: This loop calculates the cost of moving Kirill to the first `n-k` positions. If `lista_A[i] < lista_B[i]`, it means Kirill can move to position `i` with a lower cost, so it adds the cost to `pref` and resets `soma_b`. Otherwise, it adds the cost to `soma_b`.
- **Second Loop (n-k to n-1)**: This loop calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` positions. It updates `resultado` to the minimum cost found and adds the cost of moving to each position to `soma_b`.
- **Output**: The function prints the minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The functions handle the input and output as specified, and the logic for calculating the minimum cost is sound.

### Correctness:
**True**
