### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` in `func_2`.
   - For each test case, `func_1` reads the values of `n` and `m` and the lists `a` and `b`.
   - The lists `a` and `b` are reversed to facilitate processing from the end of the queue to the front. This is a valid approach because it simplifies the logic of moving Kirill forward in the queue.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `soma_b` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative cost of bribing people in the middle of the queue.
   - `pref` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the minimum cost accumulated so far.

3. **First Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `n - k - 1` (i.e., the positions from the end of the queue that are beyond the `m`-th position).
   - For each position `i`, it checks if `a[i]` (the cost to bribe the person at position `i` to move to the front) is less than `b[i]` (the cost to bribe the person at position `i` to move to a position between `j` and `i`).
   - If `a[i] < b[i]`, Kirill will move to the front of the queue, and the cost `a[i]` is added to `pref`, and `soma_b` is reset to 0.
   - If `a[i] >= b[i]`, Kirill will not move to the front, and the cost `b[i]` is added to `soma_b`.

4. **Second Loop**:
   - The loop iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1` (i.e., the positions from the end of the queue that are within the `m`-th position).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the total cost to move Kirill to the front, which is the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `a[i]`.
   - It updates `resultado` with the minimum of the current `resultado` and the calculated cost.
   - `soma_b` is updated with the cost `b[i]`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost `resultado` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Reversing the Lists**:
  - Reversing the lists `a` and `b` is a valid approach to simplify the logic of moving Kirill forward in the queue. This ensures that the indices in the loops correspond to the positions from the end of the queue.

- **First Loop**:
  - The loop correctly processes the positions from the end of the queue that are beyond the `m`-th position.
  - The condition `a[i] < b[i]` ensures that Kirill only pays the minimum cost to move to the front if it is cheaper than moving to a position in the middle.
  - Resetting `soma_b` to 0 when `a[i] < b[i]` is correct because Kirill is moving to the front, and the cumulative cost of bribing people in the middle is no longer relevant.

- **Second Loop**:
  - The loop correctly processes the positions from the end of the queue that are within the `m`-th position.
  - The total cost calculation `pref + soma_b + a[i]` is correct because it accounts for the accumulated cost of moving to the front and the cumulative cost of bribing people in the middle.
  - Updating `resultado` with the minimum cost ensures that the program finds the least expensive way for Kirill to be among the first `m` people.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n == m` (Kirill is already in the desired position) and when `n` is small.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic and the steps taken are consistent with the problem requirements. The function summaries and the original assessment are accurate.
