The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `numero_testes` from the user input, where `1 <= numero_testes <= 10^4`. The function then calls `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times. After the function concludes, `numero_testes` remains unchanged, and the state of the program is as it was before the function call, except for any side effects caused by `func_1`. The overall purpose of the function is to execute `func_1` a specific number of times based on user input.
