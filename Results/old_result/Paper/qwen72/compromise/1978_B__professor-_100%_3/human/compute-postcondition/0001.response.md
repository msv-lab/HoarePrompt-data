The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The state of `t` ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
