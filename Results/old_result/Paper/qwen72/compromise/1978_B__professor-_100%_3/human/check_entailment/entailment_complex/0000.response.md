Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program takes into account three different scenarios based on the relationship between the usual price `a` and the promotional price `b`:

1. **If `b <= a`**: In this case, selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option because the promotional price does not offer any additional profit. The profit is simply `n * a`.

2. **If `b - a >= n`**: This means the promotional price sequence can cover all n buns, and the profit is maximized by selling all buns at the promotional prices. The formula used here is the sum of an arithmetic series from `b` to `b - n + 1`, which is `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.

3. **Otherwise**: This is the case where the promotional price sequence can only cover a portion of the buns, and the rest are sold at the usual price `a`. The profit is the sum of the promotional prices for the first `b - a` buns plus the usual price for the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns. The formula used is `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

Let's verify the correctness of each part:

- **Case 1 (`b <= a`)**: Selling all buns at `a` is correct because the promotional price does not exceed the usual price, so there's no benefit in using the promotion.
- **Case 2 (`b - a >= n`)**: The formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)` correctly calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
- **Case 3 (`b - a < n`)**: The formula `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)` correctly calculates the sum of the promotional prices for the first `b - a` buns and adds the usual price for the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns.

The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each case.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
