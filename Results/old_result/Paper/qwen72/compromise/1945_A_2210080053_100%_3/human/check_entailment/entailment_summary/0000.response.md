### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads from standard input, ignoring the first line (which contains the number of test cases). This is appropriate as per the problem description.
   - Each subsequent line is split into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Logic for Tents**:
   - The function updates `b` by adding `c` to it. This step is intended to account for the universals who can potentially fill the tents with extroverts.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents. This can be broken down as follows:
     - `-b // 3` is equivalent to `-(b // 3)`, which is the number of full tents that can be formed by extroverts and universals.
     - `a - -(b // 3)` is equivalent to `a + (b // 3)`, which is the number of tents needed for introverts plus the number of full tents for extroverts and universals.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` is used to check if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If `c` is less than `b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirement, and the function prints `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all zero, printing `0` as expected.
   - The function also handles large inputs, such as `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, and computes the correct number of tents.

4. **Correctness of the Formula**:
   - The formula `a + (b // 3)` is correct for calculating the number of tents needed for introverts and full tents for extroverts and universals.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` ensures that there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents. If this condition is not met, the function correctly prints `-1`.

5. **Example Test Cases**:
   - For the input `1 2 3`, the function correctly prints `3` because 1 tent is needed for the introvert, and the remaining 2 extroverts and 1 universal can form 1 tent, with 2 universals forming another tent.
   - For the input `1 4 1`, the function correctly prints `-1` because there are not enough universals to form a tent with the remaining extroverts.
   - For the input `1 4 2`, the function correctly prints `3` because 1 tent is needed for the introvert, and the remaining 4 extroverts and 2 universals can form 2 full tents.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the function correctly prints `-1` because there are not enough universals to form a tent with the extrovert.
   - For the input `1 3 2`, the function correctly prints `3` because 1 tent is needed for the introvert, and the remaining 3 extroverts and 2 universals can form 1 full tent.
   - For the input `19 7 18`, the function correctly prints `28` because 19 tents are needed for the introverts, and the remaining 7 extroverts and 18 universals can form 7 full tents.
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the function correctly prints `0` because no participants need tents.
   - For the input `7 0 0`, the function correctly prints `7` because 7 tents are needed for the introverts.
   - For the input `0 24 0`, the function correctly prints `8` because 24 extroverts can form 8 full tents.
   - For the input `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`, the function correctly prints `1666666667` because 1000000000 tents are needed for the introverts, and the remaining 1000000000 extroverts and 1000000000 universals can form 1000000000 full tents.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or outputs `-1` if it is impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences. The execution summary confirms that the program processes each test case and prints the correct result.
