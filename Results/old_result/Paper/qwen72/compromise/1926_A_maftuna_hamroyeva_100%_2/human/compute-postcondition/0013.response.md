The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` depends on whether the second character of `a` is 'A'. If `j` is 'A', then `h` was initially 0, and now it becomes 1. If `j` is not 'A', then `h` was initially 1, and now it becomes 2. The values of `t`, `i`, `a`, `j`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `j` is the second character of `a`. If `j` is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 2.**
