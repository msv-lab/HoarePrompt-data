The code snippet `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to the integer input provided by the user. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, the new value of `t` will also fall within this range. The other details about the test cases (each containing a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all t strings being distinct) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input such that 1 <= t <= 32, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and all t strings are distinct.**
