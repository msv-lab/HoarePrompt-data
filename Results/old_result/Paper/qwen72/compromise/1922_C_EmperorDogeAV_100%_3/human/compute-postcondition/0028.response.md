Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 2`, `back` is `cities[n - 3]`, and `forward` is 999999999999999999.**

Explanation: The value of `back` is updated to the value of `cities[i - 1]`. Given that `i` is `n - 2`, `i - 1` is `n - 3`. Therefore, `back` is now equal to `cities[n - 3]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
