Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 2`, `back` is set to `cities[n - 3]`, `forward` is set to `cities[n - 1]`, and `prog_cities[n - 2]` is set to `abs(cities[n - 1] - cities[n - 2])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `prog_cities[i]` is updated to the absolute difference between `forward` and `cities[i]`.
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, `prog_cities[n - 2]` is set to `abs(cities[n - 1] - cities[n - 2])`.
- The values of `cities`, `n`, and the other elements of `prog_cities` remain unchanged.
- The values of `back` and `forward` are still set to `cities[n - 3]` and `cities[n - 1]` respectively, as they were in the initial state.
