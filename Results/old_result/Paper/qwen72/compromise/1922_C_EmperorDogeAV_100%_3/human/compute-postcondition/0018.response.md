Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order (0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `back` is `cities[n - 2]`, `forward` is 999999999999999999.**

The value of `back` is now updated to be the second-to-last element of the `cities` list, which is `cities[n - 2]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
