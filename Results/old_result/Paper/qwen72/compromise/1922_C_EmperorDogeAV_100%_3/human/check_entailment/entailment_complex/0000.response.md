### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then initializes the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists using the `func_1` function.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - It initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.
   - For each city `i`, it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the next city.
   - The function returns `prog_cities`.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums for `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` to efficiently answer the queries.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are initialized with a single zero.
   - The prefix sums are computed by iterating through the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists and appending the cumulative sums to `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, respectively.
   - `pref_sum_b` is reversed to align with the backward direction.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program reads the cities `a` and `b`.
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it uses the forward prefix sum to compute the minimum cost.
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it uses the backward prefix sum to compute the minimum cost.
   - The result is printed for each query.

### Issues and Corrections:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect. It should always set `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the closest city is the next one, and to the distance to the next city otherwise.
   - The current implementation incorrectly sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the next city when the forward distance is smaller, which is not the intended behavior.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The prefix sum calculation is correct, but it relies on the incorrect output from `func_1`.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - The query handling logic is correct, but it will produce incorrect results due to the issues in `func_1`.

### Corrected Function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        forward = 999999999999999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) <= abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i] - back)
        
    return prog_cities
```

### Correctness:

- **True** if the function `func_1` is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the function `func_1` remains as in the original program.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False** (The original program has a logical error in `func_1` that needs to be corrected as shown above.)
