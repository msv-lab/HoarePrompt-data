You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #The program returns the list `prog_cities` which contains n-1 integers. Each element `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`, where `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `cities` of `n` integers in strictly ascending order and an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 10^5). It returns a list `prog_cities` of `n-1` integers. Each element `prog_cities[i]` is either 1 or the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`, depending on which value is smaller. If the forward difference is smaller, `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between `cities[i + 1]` and `cities[i]`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query and processes it.

2. **Closest City Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to determine the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` to extreme values to handle edge cases.
   - For each city `i`, it updates `back` and `forward` to the coordinates of the previous and next cities, respectively.
   - It then checks if the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city. If so, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, indicating that the closest city is the next one. Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the previous city.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates prefix sums for both the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum array for the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum array for the backward direction, which is calculated by reversing the `cities` list and then applying `func_1`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by using extreme values for `back` and `forward` in `func_1`.
   - The prefix sum arrays are initialized with a single zero to handle the base case.

6. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The logic for determining the closest city and calculating the prefix sums is consistent with the problem description.
   - The program correctly accounts for the unique closest city constraint by using the minimum distance check in `func_1`.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently calculates the prefix sums and processes each query in constant time using these prefix sums.
   - The overall complexity is linear with respect to the number of cities and queries, which is suitable given the constraints.

8. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct minimum number of coins for each query.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
