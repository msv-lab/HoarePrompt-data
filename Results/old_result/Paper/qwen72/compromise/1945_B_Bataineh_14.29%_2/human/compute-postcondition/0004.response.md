Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then prints either `2` if `m` is less than `a` or `b`, or `m // a + m // b + 2` otherwise. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program is unchanged except for the output produced. **
