The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the function signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it appears to accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on `x` and `y` is not provided in the constraints.

Since the exact output is not specified, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `x` and `y` where 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on `x` and `y` is not defined in the provided constraints.**
