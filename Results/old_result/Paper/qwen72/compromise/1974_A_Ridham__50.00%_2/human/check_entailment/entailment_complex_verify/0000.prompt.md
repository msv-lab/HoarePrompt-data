You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        space_x = x * 1
        
        space_y = y * 4

        else:
            screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1
        
        remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y
        
        if space_x <= remaining_cells:

            else:
                extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1
            result.append(extra_screen + screen_require_for_y)
        
    #State: `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each test case, where each screen can accommodate up to 15 cells, and the total number of test cases is `n`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
    #This is printed: [result[0]]
    #[result[1]]
    #...
    #[result[n-1]] (where each element represents the number of screens required for the corresponding test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. The function calculates the number of screens required to accommodate `x` cells of type 1 (each occupying 1 cell) and `y` cells of type 4 (each occupying 4 cells), with each screen capable of holding up to 15 cells. The function then prints the number of screens required for each test case, one per line. The values of `x`, `y`, and `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons (y) is such that they do not completely fill the screens, but the remaining space is not used efficiently for 1x1 icons (x). For example, if the input is `1 2`, the program will output `2`, but the correct output should be `1` because the 2x2 icons can be placed on a single screen, and there will be enough space for the 1x1 icon.

Here is the input that fails:
```
1
1 2
```
The program outputs:
```
2
```
But the correct output should be:
```
1
```
This is because a single screen can accommodate two 2x2 icons and still have one cell left for a 1x1 icon. The program incorrectly calculates the number of screens required.
