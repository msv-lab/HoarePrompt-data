Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a sequence `a` that meets the specified conditions for each test case. Let's break down the logic and verify its correctness:

1. **Initialization of `nums`:**
   - `nums` is initialized as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This ensures that every integer from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\) can be represented as a sum of some subset of these numbers (since they form a binary basis).

2. **Finding the index `idx`:**
   - The loop finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` and sets `idx` to the index of this power of 2. This is done by iterating through the `nums` list and stopping when the next power of 2 exceeds `k`.

3. **Modifying `nums`:**
   - The program appends three new elements to `nums`:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence because the only way to get `k` would be to use `nums[idx]` and `k - nums[idx]`, but `nums[idx]` is removed.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed as a sum of some subsequence.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that `k + nums[idx] + 1` can be formed as a sum of some subsequence.
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is `nums[idx]`) is removed from `nums`.

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed.
   - The elements of the modified `nums` list are printed.

### Verification of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: No subsequence of `a` should sum to `k`.**
  - By removing `nums[idx]` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, it ensures that `k` cannot be formed as a sum of any subsequence because the only way to get `k` would be to use `nums[idx]` and `k - nums[idx]`, but `nums[idx]` is removed.

- **Condition 2: For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.**
  - The remaining elements in `nums` still form a binary basis for all numbers up to \(2^{21} - 1\), and the added elements ensure that all numbers up to `n` (except `k`) can be formed as a sum of some subsequence.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the edge cases correctly by ensuring that the sequence `nums` is always of size at most 25 and meets the required conditions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
