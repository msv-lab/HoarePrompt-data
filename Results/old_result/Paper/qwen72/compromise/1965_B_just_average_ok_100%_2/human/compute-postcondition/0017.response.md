Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `nums` list.
- For each element `nums[i]`, it checks if `nums[i]` is greater than `k`.
- If `nums[i]` is greater than `k`, it sets `idx` to `i - 1` and breaks out of the loop.
- If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, the loop completes without setting `idx`, so `idx` remains -1.
- After the loop, `i` will be the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or `len(nums)` if no such element exists.
