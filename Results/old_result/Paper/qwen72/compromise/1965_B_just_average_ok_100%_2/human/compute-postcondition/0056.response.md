Postcondition: ***`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 0, `idx` is -1, and the number of iterations remaining is one less than before. If the first element of `nums` (which is \(2^0 = 1\)) is greater than `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
