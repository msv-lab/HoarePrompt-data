The code appends the value `k - nums[idx]` to the list `nums`. Given the initial state, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 21, and `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. If no such power of 2 exists, `idx` remains -1.

Let's break down the impact:

1. **`nums`**: The list `nums` will now include an additional element, which is `k - nums[idx]`.
2. **`idx`**: The value of `idx` remains unchanged.
3. **Other Variables**: `_`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with an additional element `k - nums[idx]` appended, `i` is 21, and `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`. If no such power of 2 exists, `idx` remains -1.**
