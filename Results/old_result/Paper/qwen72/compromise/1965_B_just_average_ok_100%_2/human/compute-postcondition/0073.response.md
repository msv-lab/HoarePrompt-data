The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.

Given the constraints, the function processes each of the `t` test cases and, for each case, it performs some operation using `n` and `k` and returns a result based on these values. Since the specific output is not detailed, we can only infer that the function returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
