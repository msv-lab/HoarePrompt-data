Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.**

Explanation:
- The code `nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]` initializes `nums` to be a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), which are the integers from 1 to 1048576.
- The initial state mentions that `nums` already includes additional elements `k - nums[idx]` and `k + 1` appended, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` at the end, but without the element `1 << idx`. However, the new initialization of `nums` overrides this and sets `nums` to just the powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- The variables `n`, `k`, `i`, and `idx` remain unchanged in their definitions from the initial state.
