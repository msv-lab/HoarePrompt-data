The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `nums`. The loop's execution depends on whether `i` is within the bounds of `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) that must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. The list `nums` must still have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue executing. Since `i` is now 2, `nums` must have at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `idx` remains -1 unless `nums[1]` > `k`, in which case `idx` is set to 0 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
