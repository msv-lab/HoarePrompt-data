To determine what will be printed by the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the modifications to the `nums` list step by step:

### Initial State:
- `nums` is a list of integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), which means it contains the following elements:
  \[
  [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]
  \]

### Modifications to `nums`:
1. **Append `k - nums[idx]`**:
   - `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 in `nums` that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - For example, if `k = 100`, then `idx` would be 6 because \(2^6 = 64\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 100.
   - Therefore, `k - nums[idx]` would be \(100 - 64 = 36\).

2. **Append `k + 1`**:
   - This simply adds `k + 1` to the list.

3. **Append `k + nums[idx] + 1`**:
   - Using the same example, this would be \(100 + 64 + 1 = 165\).

4. **Remove `1 << idx`**:
   - `1 << idx` is equivalent to \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
   - Continuing the example, `1 << 6` is 64, so 64 is removed from the list.

### Final State of `nums`:
- Let's assume `k = 100` and `idx = 6` for concreteness.
- The initial `nums` list is:
  \[
  [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]
  \]
- After appending `k - nums[idx]` (36), `k + 1` (101), and `k + nums[idx] + 1` (165), the list becomes:
  \[
  [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 36, 101, 165]
  \]
- After removing `1 << idx` (64), the list becomes:
  \[
  [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 36, 101, 165]
  \]

### Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all the elements of the modified `nums` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 36 101 165**
