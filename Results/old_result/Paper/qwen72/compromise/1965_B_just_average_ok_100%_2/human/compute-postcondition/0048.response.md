The only object in the loop head is the placeholder variable `_`. The loop iterates based on the input provided by `int(input())`. Since the placeholder `_` does not hold any specific value and is just used to iterate a fixed number of times, the only state that needs to be considered is the number of iterations remaining.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state was as follows:
- `_` is a placeholder.
- `n` is an input positive integer.
- `k` is an input positive integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with the value `k - nums[idx]` appended at the end, followed by `k + 1`, and now `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended at the end, but without the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\).
- `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`.
- `idx` is `i - 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the number of iterations remaining must be greater than 0. Since the loop is controlled by the input provided, the state of the loop head does not change except for the decrement of the number of iterations remaining.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with the value `k - nums[idx]` appended at the end, followed by `k + 1`, and now `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended at the end, but without the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\), `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`, `idx` is `i - 1`, the number of iterations remaining is one less than before**.
