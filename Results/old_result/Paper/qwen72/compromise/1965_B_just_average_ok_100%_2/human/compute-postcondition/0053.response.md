Postcondition: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 0, `idx` is -1, the number of iterations remaining is one less than before, and the first element of `nums` (which is \(2^0 = 1\)) is greater than `k`.**
