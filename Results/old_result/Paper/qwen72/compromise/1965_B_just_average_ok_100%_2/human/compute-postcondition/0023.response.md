To determine what will be printed by the `print(*nums)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the construction of the `nums` list step by step.

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`_`**: This is a placeholder and does not affect the list `nums`.
2. **`n`**: A positive integer (not directly used in the construction of `nums`).
3. **`k`**: A positive integer.
4. **`nums`**: Initially, `nums` is a list of integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\), which are powers of 2. This list contains 21 elements: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.

   Additional elements are appended to this list:
   - `k - nums[idx]`
   - `k + 1`
   - `k + nums[idx] + 1`

   The element `1 << idx` is removed from the list.

5. **`i`**: The index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or `len(nums)` if no such element exists.
6. **`idx`**: `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` remains -1.

### Constructing `nums`:
1. **Initial List**: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
2. **Finding `i`**: 
   - `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`.
   - If `k` is 1000, for example, the first element greater than 1000 is 1024, so `i` would be 10.
3. **Setting `idx`**:
   - If `i` is 10, then `idx` is `i - 1`, which is 9.
4. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - Append `k - nums[idx]`: If `k` is 1000 and `idx` is 9, `nums[idx]` is 512, so `k - nums[idx]` is 488.
   - Append `k + 1`: If `k` is 1000, `k + 1` is 1001.
   - Append `k + nums[idx] + 1`: If `k` is 1000 and `idx` is 9, `nums[idx]` is 512, so `k + nums[idx] + 1` is 1513.
   - Remove `1 << idx`: If `idx` is 9, `1 << idx` is 512, so remove 512 from the list.

### Final `nums` List:
- Initial list: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`
- After modifications: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 488, 1001, 1513]`

### Output:
The `print(*nums)` statement will print all elements of the modified `nums` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 488 1001 1513**
