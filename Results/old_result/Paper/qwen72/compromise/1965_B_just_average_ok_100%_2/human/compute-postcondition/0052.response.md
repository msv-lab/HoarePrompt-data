To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head, which are `i` and `nums`.

1. **Variable `i`:** This variable is used as the loop counter and is initialized by the `range(len(nums))` function. For the loop to start, `i` should be set to 0, which is the starting point of the range generated by `range(len(nums))`.

2. **List `nums`:** The loop will iterate over the length of `nums`. For the loop to execute at least once, `nums` must contain at least one element. Given that `nums` is defined as a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), it already contains 21 elements (from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)). Therefore, `nums` meets the condition for the loop to execute.

3. **Other Variables:** Variables like `_`, `n`, `k`, and `idx` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given these considerations, the state should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 0, `idx` is -1, the number of iterations remaining is one less than before.**
