Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `idx` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `idx = i - 1` sets the value of `idx` to `i - 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `idx` is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
