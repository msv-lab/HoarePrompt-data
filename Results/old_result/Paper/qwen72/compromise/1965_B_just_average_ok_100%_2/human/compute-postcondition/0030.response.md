Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is 0, `idx` is -1, `len(nums)` is greater than 0, and the first element of `nums` (i.e., `nums[0]`) is greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `idx = i - 1` assigns the value of `i - 1` to `idx`.
- Since `i` is 0, `idx` becomes `0 - 1`, which is `-1`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
