Output State: **_ is a placeholder, `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)), `i` is the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k` or `len(nums)` if no such element exists, `idx` is `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise `idx` is -1.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `nums`, which contains powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\).
- The variable `i` keeps track of the current index in the list `nums`.
- The loop stops when it finds the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`. At this point, `idx` is set to `i - 1`, which is the index of the last element that is less than or equal to `k`.
- If no element in `nums` is greater than `k`, the loop completes all iterations, and `i` will be equal to `len(nums)`, and `idx` will remain -1.
- Therefore, after the loop finishes, `i` will be the index of the first element in `nums` that is greater than `k`, or `len(nums)` if no such element exists. `idx` will be `i - 1` if `i` is less than `len(nums)`, otherwise, it will be -1.
