The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. This operation updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the new input, while the rest of the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input positive integer, `k` is the new input positive integer, `nums` is a list of integers from 1 to 1048576 (powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\)) with the value `k - nums[idx]` appended at the end, followed by `k + 1`, and now `k + nums[idx] + 1` is appended at the end, but without the value \(2^{\text{idx}}\), `i` is the index of `k + 1` in `nums`, `idx` is `i - 1`, the number of iterations remaining is one less than before.**
