The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers, and they represent the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively, with the constraint that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the difference between the number of coins in Alice's wallet and the number of coins in Bob's wallet.
