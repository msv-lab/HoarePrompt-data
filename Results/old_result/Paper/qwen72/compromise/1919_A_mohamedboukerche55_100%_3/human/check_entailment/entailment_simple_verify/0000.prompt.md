You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input during the final iteration of the loop. The value of `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The logic used in the program is incorrect because it only checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
2 2
```
According to the problem description, the game would proceed as follows:
1. Alice has 2 coins, Bob has 2 coins.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob or keep her wallet. If she keeps her wallet, she removes 1 coin, leaving her with 1 coin and Bob with 2 coins.
3. Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice or keep his wallet. If he keeps his wallet, he removes 1 coin, leaving him with 1 coin and Alice with 1 coin.
4. Alice can now choose to swap wallets with Bob or keep her wallet. If she keeps her wallet, she removes 1 coin, leaving her with 0 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
5. Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice or keep his wallet. If he keeps his wallet, he removes 1 coin, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 0 coins.
6. Alice cannot make a move because her wallet is empty, so Bob wins.

However, the program would output:
```
Bob
```
This is correct for this specific case, but the program's logic is flawed.

### Another Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
3 1
```
According to the problem description, the game would proceed as follows:
1. Alice has 3 coins, Bob has 1 coin.
2. Alice can choose to swap wallets with Bob or keep her wallet. If she keeps her wallet, she removes 1 coin, leaving her with 2 coins and Bob with 1 coin.
3. Bob can now choose to swap wallets with Alice or keep his wallet. If he keeps his wallet, he removes 1 coin, leaving him with 0 coins and Alice with 2 coins.
4. Bob cannot make a move because his wallet is empty, so Alice wins.

However, the program would output:
```
Bob
```
This is incorrect because the program does not correctly handle the game's rules.

The program's logic of checking if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` is too simplistic and does not account for the game's dynamics, particularly the optimal play strategy. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
