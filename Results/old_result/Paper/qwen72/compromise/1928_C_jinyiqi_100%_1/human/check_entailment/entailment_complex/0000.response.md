### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \)
     - \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - For each condition that is true, it calls `func_1` to get the divisors of the respective value.
   - It filters the divisors to find valid \( k \) values and appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique valid \( k \) values.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer \( x \) and returns a list of all divisors of \( x \) in descending order.
   - It works by iterating from 1 to the square root of \( x \) and collecting divisors in two lists:
     - `output1` for divisors less than or equal to the square root.
     - `output2` for divisors greater than the square root.
   - It then reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` to form the final list of divisors in descending order.

4. **Logic for Valid \( k \) Values**:
   - The program checks if \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \).
   - For each valid condition, it finds the divisors of the respective value and checks if they can form a valid \( k \).
   - A valid \( k \) must satisfy:
     - \( k > 1 \)
     - \( k \) must be a divisor of \( (n + x - 2) \) or \( (n - x) \)
     - \( k \geq x \)

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid.
   - It also ensures that the divisors are checked for the condition \( k \geq x \).

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The function `func_1` is efficient as it only iterates up to the square root of \( x \), which is \( O(\sqrt{x}) \).
   - The main loop and the filtering process are also efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints and the problem description. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find all divisors of a number in descending order, and the main logic correctly filters these divisors to find valid \( k \) values.

### Correctness:
**True**
