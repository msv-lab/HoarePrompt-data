The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `x` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `x` must still satisfy the condition 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.

Given that the loop is about to start the next iteration, `i` will be 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x`.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 2, and if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`), `output1` is a list containing [1] and `output2` is a list containing [x]. Otherwise, `output1` and `output2` remain empty lists.**
