Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 3, `output1` is a list containing [1, 2, 3] if `x % 2 == 0` otherwise `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is a list containing [x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3)] if `x % 2 == 0` otherwise `output2` is a list containing [int(x / 3)].**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- The value of `i` remains 3.
- The value of `output1` remains a list containing [1, 2, 3] if `x % 2 == 0` and an empty list otherwise.
- The value of `output2` is updated by appending `int(x / 3)` to it. If `x % 2 == 0`, `output2` was initially [x, int(x / 2)], and now it becomes [x, int(x / 2), int(x / 3)]. If `x % 2 != 0`, `output2` was initially an empty list, and now it becomes a list containing [int(x / 3)].
