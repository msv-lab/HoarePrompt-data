The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list that combines two lists: `output2` and `output1`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`.
