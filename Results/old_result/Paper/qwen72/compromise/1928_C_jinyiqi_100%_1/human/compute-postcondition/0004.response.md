Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `output1` is a list containing [1], `output2` is an empty list, and `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).** 

The value of `i` (which is 1) is appended to `output1`, so `output1` now contains the value 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
