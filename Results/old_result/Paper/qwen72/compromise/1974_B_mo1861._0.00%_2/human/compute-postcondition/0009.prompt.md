You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length is between 1 and 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    for (i, c) in enumerate(sorted(set(b))):
        char_map[c] = chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))
        
    #State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character from the string `b` is mapped to a lowercase Latin letter, starting from the last letter of the alphabet and moving backwards. The length of `b` remains unchanged, and `b` is still a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: `s` is a string where each character from `b` has been replaced by the corresponding lowercase Latin letter from the `char_map` dictionary, and the length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`. The `char_map` dictionary remains unchanged.
    return s
    #The program returns the string `s`, where each character from the original string `b` has been replaced by the corresponding lowercase Latin letter from the `char_map` dictionary, and the length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `b` and returns a new string `s` where each character in `b` is replaced by the corresponding character from the `char_map` dictionary, maintaining the same length as `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the string `s`, where each character from the original string `b` has been replaced by the corresponding lowercase Latin letter from the `char_map` dictionary, and the length of `s` is the same as the length of `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
