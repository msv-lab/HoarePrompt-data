Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (depending on the previous iteration), `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the previous iteration), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`**. 

The value of `mi` is updated to the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
