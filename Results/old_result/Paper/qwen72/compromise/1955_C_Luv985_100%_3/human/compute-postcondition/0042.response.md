Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1 (depending on whether `a[l]` was 0), `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` (depending on the previous iteration), `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the previous iteration and whether `a[l]` was 0), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**
