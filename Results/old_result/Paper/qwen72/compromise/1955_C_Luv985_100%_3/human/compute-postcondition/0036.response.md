The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from the element at index `r` of the list `a`. Here's the updated state:

- `T` is a positive integer decreased by 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `k` must be greater than 0.
- `a` is a list of integers.
- `l` is 0.
- `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (depending on the previous iteration).
- `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the previous iteration).
- `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`.
- `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`.
- `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (depending on the previous iteration), `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the previous iteration), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`.**
