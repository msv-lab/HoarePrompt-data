Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, the current value of `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and the current value of `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and the current value of `a[r]` remains 0. If `a[r]` is not 0, then `r` remains `n - 1` and `ans` remains 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `t` is set to `k % 2`, `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the initial condition), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1 (depending on whether `a[l]` was 0), `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (depending on the previous iteration), `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the previous iteration and whether `a[l]` was 0). If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and `a[r]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3` (depending on the previous iteration) and `ans` is updated to 1, 2, or 3 (depending on the previous iteration and whether `a[l]` was 0). If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2` or `n - 3`, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, with `a[l]` decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` decreased by `mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1 or 2, `ans` is updated to 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l-1]` and `a[r]`, with `a[l-1]` decreased by `mi` and `a[r]` decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is not 0, `r` remains `n - 1` or `n - 2`, and no further changes are made to `l`, `ans`, or `mi`. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains greater than 0, `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2, and `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, 2, or 3. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
