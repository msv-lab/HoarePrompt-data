Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` (depending on the previous iteration), `ans` is 0, 1, or 2 (depending on the previous iteration), `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`, `t` is the remainder when `k` is divided by 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
