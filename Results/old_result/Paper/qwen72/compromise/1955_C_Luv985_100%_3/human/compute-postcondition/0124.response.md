Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 2, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - (2 * mi)`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, 1, or 2, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `a[l]` is `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. If `a[l]` is 0, `l` is 1 or 2, and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `l` is 0, and `ans` is 0, 1, or 2.***
