Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is an integer (either 0 or a positive integer), `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `n` is now an integer, `k` is no longer a string.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[n - 1]` is 0, `r` is `n - 2` and `ans` is 1 or 2. If `a[0]` is 0, `l` is 1, `ans` is 2, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `ans` is 1, and `a[0]` is non-zero. If `a[n - 1]` is non-zero, `r` is `n - 1` and `ans` is 0 or 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `a[l] - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - (2 * mi)`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is `r - 1` and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a[r]` is not 0, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 0, 1, or 2. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `t` is `k % 2`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2` if `a[r]` is not 0, and `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` is 0, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[r]` is not 0, and 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 if `a[r]` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi` if `a[r]` is not 0, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi` if `a[r]` is 0. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is 1 and `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[r]` is not 0, and 2, 3, 4, or 5 if `a[r]` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3 if `a[r]` is not 0, and 1, 2, 3, or 4 if `a[r]` is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
