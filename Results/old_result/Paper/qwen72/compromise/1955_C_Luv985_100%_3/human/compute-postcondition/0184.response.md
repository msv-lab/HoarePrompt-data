Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - (2 * mi)`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[r]` is `a[r] - mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, `r` is `r - 1` and `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. If `a[r]` is not 0, `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[l]` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 0, 1, or 2. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `t` is `k % 2`. If `a[l] - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, or 3, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
