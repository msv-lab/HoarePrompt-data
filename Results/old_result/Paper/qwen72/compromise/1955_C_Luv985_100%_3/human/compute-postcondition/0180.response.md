Output State: **`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

The value of `t` is now the remainder of `k` divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
