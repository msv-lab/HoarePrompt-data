Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `k` is a positive integer decreased by `2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers where elements between `l` and `r` (inclusive) are non-zero, while elements before `l` and after `r` are zero, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `a[n - 1]` is now `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `a[r]` (i.e., `a[n - 1]`) is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1 or 2. If `a[0]` is 0, then `l` is 1, `ans` is 2, and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0, `ans` is 1, and `a[0]` is non-zero. If `a[r]` is non-zero, then `r` is `n - 1` and `ans` is 0 or 1.***
