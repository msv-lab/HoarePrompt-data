Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, and `mi` is the minimum value between the original `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is decreased by `2 * mi`, the current value of `a[0]` is decreased by `mi`, and the current value of `a[n - 1]` is decreased by `mi`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1, and the current value of `a[r]` remains 0. If `a[r]` is not 0, then `r` remains `n - 1` and `ans` remains 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains unchanged, `t` is set to `k % 2`, `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the initial condition), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
