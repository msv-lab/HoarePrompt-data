### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1 = a * n`: This is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price.
     - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`: This is the cost of buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `print(min(ans1, ans2))`.

3. **Special Case Handling:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program directly prints the value of `a` because there is only one yogurt to buy, and the promotion price does not apply.

4. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost to buy `n` yogurts by comparing the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price with the cost of buying pairs at the promotion price and the remaining at the regular price.
   - The function prints the minimum cost for each test case and does not return any value.

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

The original assessment states that the program is correct. Let's verify this by considering the logic and the given constraints:

- **Regular Price Calculation (`ans1`):**
  - `ans1 = a * n` correctly calculates the total cost if all yogurts are bought at the regular price.

- **Promotion Price Calculation (`ans2`):**
  - `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` correctly calculates the cost by:
    - Buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price (`b * (n // 2)`).
    - Buying the remaining yogurts (if any) at the regular price (`a * (n % 2)`).

- **Minimum Cost Selection:**
  - The program uses `print(min(ans1, ans2))` to print the minimum of the two calculated costs, which is the correct approach to find the minimum cost for `n` yogurts.

- **Special Case Handling:**
  - If `n == 1`, the program correctly prints `a` because the promotion price does not apply to a single yogurt.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - Output: `min(10, 9) = 9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 9 + 5 = 14`
  - Output: `min(15, 14) = 14` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 11 + 5 = 16`
  - Output: `min(15, 16) = 15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22 + 0 = 22`
  - Output: `min(20, 22) = 20` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all the test cases and the logic is sound. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
