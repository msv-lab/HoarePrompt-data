### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Handling the Case When `n` is 1:**
   - If `n` is 1, Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price `a`. The program correctly prints `a` in this case.

3. **Handling the Case When `n` is Greater Than 1:**
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is the cost of buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
       - `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
       - `n % 2` gives the number of yogurts that cannot form a pair and must be bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `min(ans1, ans2)`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price.
   - The program also handles the case where `n` is even or odd correctly, as the formula `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` accounts for both scenarios.

5. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` ensures that the maximum number of pairs are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - This formula is mathematically sound and covers all possible values of `n` within the given constraints.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 2 = 10`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (2 // 2) + 5 * (2 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 0 = 9`
  - Output: `9` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 9 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 9 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 14`
  - Output: `14` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 3 = 15`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (3 // 2) + 5 * (3 % 2) = 11 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 16`
  - Output: `15` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `ans1 = 5 * 4 = 20`
  - `ans2 = 11 * (4 // 2) + 5 * (4 % 2) = 11 * 2 + 5 * 0 = 22`
  - Output: `20` (Correct)
