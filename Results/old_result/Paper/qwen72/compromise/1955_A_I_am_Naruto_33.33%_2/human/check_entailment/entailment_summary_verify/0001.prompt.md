You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within specified ranges. For each test case, if `n > 1`, it calculates two values: `a * n` and `b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`, and prints the minimum of these two values. If `n == 1`, it prints the value of `a`. The function does not modify the input values `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of yogurts, the price of one yogurt, and the price of two yogurts on promotion, respectively.

2. **Handling the Case When `n` is 1:**
   - If `n` is 1, Maxim can only buy one yogurt at the regular price `a`. The program correctly prints `a` in this case.

3. **Handling the Case When `n` is Greater Than 1:**
   - The program calculates two possible costs:
     - `ans1` is the cost of buying all `n` yogurts at the regular price, which is `a * n`.
     - `ans2` is the cost of buying as many yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurts at the regular price. This is calculated as `b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)`.
       - `n // 2` gives the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price.
       - `n % 2` gives the number of yogurts that cannot form a pair and must be bought at the regular price.
   - The program then prints the minimum of these two costs using `min(ans1, ans2)`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - For `n` greater than 1, the program correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering both the regular price and the promotion price.

5. **Correctness of the Formula:**
   - The formula `ans2 = b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)` ensures that the maximum number of pairs are bought at the promotion price, and any remaining yogurts are bought at the regular price.
   - This formula is mathematically sound and covers all possible values of `n` within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
