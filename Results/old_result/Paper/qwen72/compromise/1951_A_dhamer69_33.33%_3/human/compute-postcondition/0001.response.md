The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. To ensure that the loop executes at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers with `start` <= `end`, `t` must be greater than 0**
