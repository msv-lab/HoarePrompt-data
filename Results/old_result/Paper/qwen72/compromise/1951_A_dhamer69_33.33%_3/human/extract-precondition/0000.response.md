It seems there's a misunderstanding in the provided example. The function definition should match the problem description. Let's correct that and then extract the precondition.

The correct function definition based on the problem description should be:

```python
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Now, let's extract the precondition:

Precondition: **start and end are integers, with start <= end, and they represent the range of folder names to be considered, where the folder names are numeric.**
