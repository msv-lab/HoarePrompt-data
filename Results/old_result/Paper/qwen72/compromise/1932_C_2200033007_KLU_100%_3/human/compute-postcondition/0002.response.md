Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), `a` is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4), `s` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is an empty list, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The value of `r` is now set to `n - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
