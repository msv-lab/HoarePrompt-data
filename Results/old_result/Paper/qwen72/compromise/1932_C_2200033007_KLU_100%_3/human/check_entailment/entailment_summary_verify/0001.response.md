### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order of the commands.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - This part of the program is correct and correctly constructs the list `b` in the order of elements removed from `a`.

4. **Calculating the Product Modulo:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`.
   - The program iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order (since the last element removed should be the first one considered in the product).
   - For each element `v` in `b`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m` and appends `p` to `ans`.
   - This part of the program is also correct. By iterating in reverse, it ensures that the product is calculated in the correct order, starting from the last removed element and moving towards the first removed element.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the results in `ans` in reverse order to match the order of the commands.
   - This is necessary because the elements in `b` are in the order they were removed, and the product modulo `m` needs to be calculated in the order they were originally in the array `a`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Initialization:**
  - The pointers `l` and `r` are correctly initialized to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
  - The list `b` is correctly used to store the elements removed from `a` in the order of the commands.

- **Command Processing:**
  - The loop correctly processes each command in the string `s`.
  - The conditions for 'L' and 'R' commands are correctly handled, updating the pointers and the list `b` accordingly.

- **Product Calculation:**
  - The product modulo `m` is calculated correctly by iterating through the list `b` in reverse.
  - The use of `reversed(b)` ensures that the product is calculated in the correct order, starting from the last removed element and moving towards the first removed element.
  - The results are stored in `ans` and then returned in reverse order to match the order of the commands.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the commands and maintains the state of the array `a` as elements are removed. The product modulo `m` is calculated correctly for each state of the array, and the results are returned in the correct order as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
