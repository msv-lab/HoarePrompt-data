Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description in every potential case. Specifically, the program does not output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at the beginning of each command execution. Instead, it appends the elements being removed to a list `b` and then calculates the product in reverse order, which is not what the problem description requires.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 6
3 1 4 2
LRRL
```

The expected output should be:
```
0 2 4 1
```

However, the program will produce:
```
3 2 4 1
```

This is because the program appends the elements being removed to `b` and then calculates the product in reverse order, which does not match the problem's requirement to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at the beginning of each command execution.
