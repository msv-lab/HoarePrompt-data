### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `b` is initialized as an empty list to store the elements of `a` in the order specified by `s`.
     - `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n-1` respectively, representing the left and right indices of the array `a`.

   - **Processing Commands**:
     - The program iterates through each command in `s`.
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements `r`.
     - This correctly simulates the removal of elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`.

   - **Calculating Products**:
     - The program initializes `p` to 1, which will be used to accumulate the product of elements.
     - It iterates through the elements of `b` in reverse order.
     - For each element `v` in `b`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v`, modulo `m`.
     - It appends the current value of `p` to `ans`.
     - This correctly calculates the product of the remaining elements of `a` at each step, modulo `m`.

   - **Returning Results**:
     - The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which ensures that the results are in the correct order as specified by the problem.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of each test case correctly.

### Correctness:
The program correctly processes the commands and calculates the required products modulo `m` for each step. The logic and flow of the program match the problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
