#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 \leq t \leq 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers where 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9, representing the elements of the array a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It modifies the list `a` by incrementing each element by its index plus one. Then, it generates a new list `ans` that includes all unique elements from the modified `a`, sorted in descending order, and fills any gaps up to `n` elements with additional numbers that are not present in the modified `a`. The function prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. After the function concludes, the list `a` has been modified, and the list `ans` contains `n` elements, with all elements from the original `a` included and any necessary additional elements to reach `n` elements. The `Counter` object used to track the counts of elements in `a` is reset to zero for all elements.
