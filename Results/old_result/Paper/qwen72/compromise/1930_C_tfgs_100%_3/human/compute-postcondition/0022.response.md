To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for j in range(adv):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The variables in the loop head are `j` and `adv`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `adv`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `i` is greater than 0
- `n` must be greater than 0
- Each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`
- `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`
- `cur` is 0
- `cnt` is `n - len(a)`
- `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`
- `a` is now sorted in descending order
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `adv` must be greater than `j`

At the start of the next iteration:
- `j` will be incremented by 1.
- The condition `adv` must be greater than `j` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
- `j` is `j + 1`
- `adv` must be greater than `j + 1`

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is `n - len(a)`, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `a[i - 1] - j - 1` and `a[i - 1] - j - 1`, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `j` is `j + 1`, `adv` must be greater than `j + 1`**
