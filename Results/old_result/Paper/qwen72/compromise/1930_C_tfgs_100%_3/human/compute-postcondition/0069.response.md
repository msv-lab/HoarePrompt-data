Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `i` is `n`: This means that `i` is equal to the value of `n`.
- `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements that were added during the loop execution to fill the gap up to `n` elements.
- The last `cnt` elements of `ans` are a decreasing sequence starting from `ans[-cnt-1] - 1` and ending at `ans[-1]` which is `ans[-cnt-1] - cnt`.
- `counter` is a Counter object with all counts of elements in `a` reduced to 0.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `cur` is 0.

### Analysis:
1. **List `ans`**:
   - `ans` contains all elements from the list `a`.
   - Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements were added to `ans` to form a decreasing sequence.
   - Therefore, `ans` is exactly the same as the list `a`.

2. **Counter `counter`**:
   - All counts of elements in `a` are reduced to 0, meaning that the Counter object is empty or all values are 0.

3. **Variables `i`, `cnt`, and `cur`**:
   - `i` is equal to `n`, but this doesn't affect the `print` statement directly.
   - `cnt` is 0, which means no additional elements were added to `ans`.
   - `cur` is 0, but this also doesn't affect the `print` statement directly.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(*ans)
```
- The `print` statement will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.
- Since `ans` is the same as the list `a` and no additional elements were added, the output will be the elements of `a` separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **[elements of list a separated by spaces]**

This means that the elements of the list `a` will be printed in the same order as they appear in `a`, separated by spaces.
