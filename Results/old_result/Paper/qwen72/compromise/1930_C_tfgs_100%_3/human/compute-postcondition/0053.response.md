Output State: **`adv` must be greater than 2, `j` is 2, `ans` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 3`**

Explanation:
- The value of `adv` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 2.
- The value of `j` remains unchanged and is still 2.
- A new element is appended to the list `ans`, which is equal to `a[i - 1] - j - 1`. Given that `j` is 2, the new element appended is `a[i - 1] - 3`. Therefore, `ans` now has a new element appended which is equal to `a[i - 1] - 3`.
