Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 0 or greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, each element `a[i]` in the list `a` is increased by `i + 1` for all `0 ≤ i < n`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, but the count of `a[i]` is decreased by 1, `cur` is 0 or `0 - adv`, `cnt` is `n - len(a)` or `n - len(a) - adv`, `ans` is a list containing `adv` elements, each element being `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for `j` in the range `0` to `adv - 1` and now also contains `a[i]`, `a` is now sorted in descending order, `j` is `adv - 1` if `i > 0`, and `adv` must be greater than or equal to `j + 1` if `i > 0`.**
