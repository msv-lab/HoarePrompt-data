Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is the number of unique integers in `a` where each integer is considered as its own complement (i.e., `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`), and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `a` or its complement, and the value is the count of how many times the complement has been encountered minus the number of times the integer itself has been encountered.**
