Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `operations` (a list of tuples where each tuple is `(op_type, value)` with `op_type` being an integer in {1, 2} and `value` being an integer within specific ranges based on `op_type`), and `queries` (a list of positive integers). The function returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`, where each query `k` corresponds to the element at the index `(k - 1) % len(array)`. The `array` and `queries` remain unchanged.**
