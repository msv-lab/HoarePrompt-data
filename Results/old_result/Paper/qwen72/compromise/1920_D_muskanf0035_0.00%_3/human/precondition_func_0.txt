n is a positive integer, operations is a list of tuples (op_type, value) where op_type is an integer in {1, 2} and value is an integer such that 1 <= value <= n for op_type = 1 and 1 <= value <= 10^9 for op_type = 2, queries is a list of positive integers k such that 1 <= k <= min(10^18, c), where c is the size of the array after all operations.
