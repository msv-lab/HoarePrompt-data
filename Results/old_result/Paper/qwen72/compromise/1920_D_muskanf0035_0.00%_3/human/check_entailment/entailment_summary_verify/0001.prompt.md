You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, operations, queries):
    array = []
    result = []
    for (op_type, value) in operations:
        if op_type == 1:
            array.append(value)
        else:
            array.extend([array[i] for i in range(len(array))])
    for k in queries:
        result.append(array[(k - 1) % len(array)])
    return result

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
        operations = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        queries = list(map(int, input().split()))
        result = func_1(n, operations, queries)
        print(*result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `q` from the input, followed by `n` lines of operations and `q` integers as queries. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` to process these inputs and prints the resulting list of integers. The function does not return any value; its primary purpose is to produce and print the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the only lasting effect is the output produced by the `print` statements.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have an array `a` that starts empty.
   - We perform `n` operations, which can be of two types:
     - Type 1: Append an integer `x` to the array.
     - Type 2: Append `x` copies of the current array to itself.
   - After performing all operations, we need to answer `q` queries, each asking for the `k`-th element of the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function takes `n` (number of operations), `operations` (list of operations), and `queries` (list of queries).
     - It initializes an empty array `array` and an empty list `result` to store the answers.
     - It iterates through each operation:
       - If the operation type is 1, it appends the value `x` to the array.
       - If the operation type is 2, it appends `x` copies of the current array to itself.
     - After all operations, it processes the queries:
       - For each query `k`, it appends the element at position `(k - 1) % len(array)` to the result list.
     - Finally, it returns the result list.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, the number of operations and queries.
     - It reads the operations and queries.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the results.

3. **Identifying Potential Issues:**
   - **Memory and Performance:**
     - The array `array` can grow very large, especially with type 2 operations where `x` can be up to \(10^9\).
     - This can lead to memory issues and performance degradation.
   - **Handling Large Queries:**
     - The queries can be up to \(10^{18}\), but the array size is limited by the operations.
     - The current implementation uses modulo operation to handle queries, which is correct in theory but may not be efficient or memory-friendly for very large arrays.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic for appending elements and handling queries is correct.
   - However, the implementation is not efficient for large inputs, particularly when `x` in type 2 operations is very large.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct but inefficient for large inputs. Given the constraints, the program may fail due to memory limits or time limits. Therefore, the program is not considered correct for the problem as stated.

### Correctness:
**False**
