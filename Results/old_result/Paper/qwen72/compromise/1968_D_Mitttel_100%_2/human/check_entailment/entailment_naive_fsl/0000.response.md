Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game for a player, but it has a logical error in how it calculates the maximum possible score.

The issue lies in the line:
```python
mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
```
This line is intended to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve by either staying at the current position or moving to the next position. However, this logic is flawed because it assumes that the player can stay at the current position for `k` turns and add `k * a[s]` to the score, which is not how the game is played. The player can only stay at the current position or move to the next position, and the score should be updated accordingly for each turn.

Additionally, the program modifies the input arrays `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element, which is not necessary and could lead to incorrect results if the input arrays are not properly adjusted.

To correctly simulate the game, the function should keep track of the score and the position for each turn, and update the score based on the player's decision to stay or move. The current implementation does not accurately reflect the game rules and can produce incorrect results.
