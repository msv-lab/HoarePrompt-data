Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw in the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to simulate the game for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns, but it incorrectly calculates the maximum score. Specifically, the issue lies in the line:

```python
mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
```

This line is intended to keep track of the maximum possible score a player can achieve by either staying at the current position or moving to the next position. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the player might stay at the current position for multiple turns, which can significantly affect the score.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly simulate the game, we need to consider the following:

1. **Cycle Detection**: If a player enters a cycle, the score will repeat after a certain number of turns. We need to detect cycles and handle them appropriately.
2. **Score Calculation**: We need to calculate the score for each turn, considering whether the player stays or moves to the next position.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    visited = [False] * n
    cycle_start = -1
    cycle_sum = 0
    cycle_length = 0
    current_position = s
    
    for turn in range(k):
        if visited[current_position]:
            if cycle_start == -1:
                cycle_start = current_position
                cycle_sum = 0
                cycle_length = 0
            cycle_sum += a[current_position]
            cycle_length += 1
        else:
            visited[current_position] = True
            score += a[current_position]
            current_position = p[current_position]
    
    if cycle_start != -1:
        # Calculate the score for the remaining turns in the cycle
        remaining_turns = k - turn
        full_cycles = remaining_turns // cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_sum
        remaining_turns %= cycle_length
        
        for _ in range(remaining_turns):
            score += a[current_position]
            current_position = p[current_position]
    
    return score

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Cycle Detection**: The program now detects when a player enters a cycle and keeps track of the cycle's start position, sum of scores within the cycle, and the length of the cycle.
2. **Score Calculation**: After detecting a cycle, the program calculates the score for the remaining turns by adding the full cycles' scores and then the scores for the remaining turns within the cycle.

This approach ensures that the program correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the scores after `k` turns.
