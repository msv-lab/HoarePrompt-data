Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where each element in `p` is a unique integer from 1 to `n`, and each element in `a` is a positive integer (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9). `s` is now a list containing the integers at indices `s[0]` and `s[1]` in `p`. `k` is now `k - 3` and must be greater than 0. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is now `max(mx, cur + k * a[s])`. `cur` is now `cur + a[s]`. `vis` is a list of `n` integers where `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are 1, and all other elements are 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = p[s]` updates the list `s` to contain the integers at the indices `s[0]` and `s[1]` in the list `p`.
- The initial state specifies that `s` contains indices that have not been visited yet, and `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` are 1.
- After the code execution, `s` will contain the values at those indices in `p`, but the other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
