Output State: **The program returns the maximum value `mx` calculated during the loop, which is the greatest value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered.** Here, `mx` is the maximum value that was determined by adding the cumulative sum `cur` of the elements in `a` that were visited during the loop to the product of `k` (the number of remaining turns not executed because the position `s` was already visited) and the value of `a` at position `s`.
