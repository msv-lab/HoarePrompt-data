The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It determines the minimum length of consecutive identical elements in the list `a` for each test case. If the list `a` is entirely composed of the same element or if no such consecutive identical elements are found, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of consecutive identical elements found in the list. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it prints the result for each test case.
