Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^4, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `i` is 2, `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous `num` (which was `ar[0]`), `minn` is 1.**

The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Since `same` is 1, `minn` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
