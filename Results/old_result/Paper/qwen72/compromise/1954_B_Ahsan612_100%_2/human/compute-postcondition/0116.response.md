Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **_ is 2**: This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
2. **`n` is an input integer**: This variable is also not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
3. **`ar` is a list of integers input by the user**: This list is used to determine the value of `num` and `i`.
4. **`same` is 1**: This variable is not used in the code snippet, so it does not affect the output.
5. **`num` is the last element of `ar`**: This means `num` is the last integer in the list `ar`.
6. **`i` is equal to the length of `ar`**: This means `i` is the number of elements in the list `ar`.
7. **`minn` is the minimum of the original `minn` and 1**: This means `minn` is either `inf` (infinity) or the length of `ar`, and it is updated to be the minimum of its original value and 1. Since `inf` is greater than 1, `minn` will be 1.
8. **`minn` is either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`**: Given the previous point, `minn` will be 1.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(-1)
```

This code snippet simply prints the integer `-1`. The values of the variables and objects described in the initial state do not influence the output of this specific `print` statement.

Output: **-1**
