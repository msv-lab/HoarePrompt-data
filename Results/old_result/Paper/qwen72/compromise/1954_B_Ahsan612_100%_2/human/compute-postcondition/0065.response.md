The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len(ar)`. If `i` is less than `len(ar)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 or 4, and `len(ar)` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`.

Since `len(ar)` is already greater than `i`, and `i` is 3 or 4, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute one more time. The loop condition is already satisfied.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, `len(ar)` is greater than `i`, if `ar[i-1]` is equal to `num`, `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is the integer at index `i-1` in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is set to 1.**
