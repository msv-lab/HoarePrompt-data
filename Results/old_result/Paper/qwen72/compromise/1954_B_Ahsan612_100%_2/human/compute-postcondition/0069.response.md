Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 4 or 5, `len(ar)` is greater than `i`, `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is set to 1.** 

The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. The value of `same` is then set to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
