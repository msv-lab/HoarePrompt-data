Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 4 or 5, `len(ar)` is greater than `i`, if `ar[i-2]` is equal to `num`, `same` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `num` is the integer at index `i-2` in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is set to 1.**
