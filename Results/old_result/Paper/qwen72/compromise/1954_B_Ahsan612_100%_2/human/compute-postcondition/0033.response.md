Output State: **_ is 0, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, ar is a list of integers input by the user, same is 1, num is the last element of ar, i is len(ar), minn is the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in ar.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `_` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The list `ar` remains unchanged, as it is only read and not modified within the loop.
- The variable `same` is reset to 1 at the end of the loop, as the loop will always end with a check for a new number, and `same` is set to 1 when a new number is found.
- The variable `num` will be the last element of the list `ar`, because the loop iterates through the list and updates `num` to the current element whenever a different element is found.
- The variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `ar`, because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.
- The variable `minn` will be the minimum value of the lengths of consecutive sequences of the same number in the list `ar`. This is because `minn` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value of `same` whenever a different number is found in the list.
