Postcondition: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 3 or 4, `len(ar)` is greater than `i`. If `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, `same` is increased by 1, and `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. Otherwise, `num` is set to the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`, and `same` is set to 1.**
