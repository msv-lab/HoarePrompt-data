Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the third element of `ar`, `i` is 2, `minn` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**

The value of `minn` is updated to 1, as `min(minn, same)` evaluates to 1 (since `same` is 1 and `minn` was initially `inf`). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
