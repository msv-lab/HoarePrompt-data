Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `ar` is a list of integers input by the user.
   - `same` is 1.
   - `num` is the last element of `ar`.
   - `i` is equal to the length of `ar`.
   - `minn` is the minimum value between the previous `minn` and `same`. Additionally, `minn` is either infinity (`inf`) or equal to the length of `ar`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```
   print(-1)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the integer `-1`.
   - The values of the variables `_`, `n`, `ar`, `same`, `num`, `i`, and `minn` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the constant value `-1`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output `-1`.

Output: **-1**
