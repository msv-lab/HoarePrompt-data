Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 2 elements. If `ar[1]` is equal to `num` (the first element of `ar`), `same` is 2, `num` remains the first element of `ar`, `i` is 1, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, `same` is 1, `num` is updated to the third element of `ar`, `i` is 2, and `minn` is 1.***
