Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 4 elements, `same` is 1, `num` is the fifth element of `ar`, `i` is 4, `minn` is 1, and the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`.**

The code snippet `same = 1` does not change the value of `same` because it is already 1 in the initial state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
