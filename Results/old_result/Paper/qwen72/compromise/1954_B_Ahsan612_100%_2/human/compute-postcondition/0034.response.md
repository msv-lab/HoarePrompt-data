Output State: **_ is 0, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, ar is a list of integers input by the user, same is 1, num is the last element of ar, i is len(ar), minn is the minimum value between the original minn and 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `minn = min(minn, same)` updates the value of `minn` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `same`. Since `same` is 1, `minn` is now the minimum value between the original `minn` and 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
