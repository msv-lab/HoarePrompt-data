Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user and must have at least 6 elements, `minn` is 1, the second element of `ar` is not equal to the third element of `ar`, `same` is 1, `num` is the sixth element of `ar`, `i` is 6.**

The code snippet `same = 1` sets the variable `same` to 1. Since this is the only change in the code, the other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this update to `same` while keeping all other conditions and values unchanged.
