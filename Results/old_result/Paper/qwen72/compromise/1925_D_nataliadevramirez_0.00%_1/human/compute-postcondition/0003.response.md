The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Since there are no parameter constraints or relationships provided, and no specific output described, we cannot determine a specific return value or output behavior from the given information. However, a function without parameters can return any type of value or perform any operation that does not depend on external inputs.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and can return any value or perform any operation.**
