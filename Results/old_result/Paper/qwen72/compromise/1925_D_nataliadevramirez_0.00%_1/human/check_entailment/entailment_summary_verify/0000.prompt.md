You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship data. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `m`, `k`, and the friendship data, and prints the result of `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged, but the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are not retained between iterations.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the friendship values for all pairs, multiplied by the sum of the first k natural numbers, and then takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, this approach does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion, which is essential for calculating the expected value.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
Here, there are 3 children, 1 pair of friends (1 and 2) with an initial friendship value of 1, and 2 excursions.

**Expected Output:**
The expected value of the sum of friendship values of the chosen pairs over the 2 excursions should be calculated as follows:
- There are 3 children, so there are \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) possible pairs: (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3).
- The pair (1, 2) has an initial friendship value of 1.
- The probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) in each excursion is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

For the first excursion:
- If (1, 2) is chosen, the friendship value becomes 2.
- If (1, 3) or (2, 3) is chosen, the friendship value remains 1.

For the second excursion:
- If (1, 2) is chosen again, the friendship value becomes 3.
- If (1, 3) or (2, 3) is chosen, the friendship value remains 2.

The expected value of the sum of friendship values over the 2 excursions is:
\[ E = \left( \frac{1}{3} \times (1 + 2) \right) + \left( \frac{2}{3} \times (1 + 1) \right) = \frac{1}{3} \times 3 + \frac{2}{3} \times 2 = 1 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \]

However, the program calculates:
\[ \text{result} = 1 \times \left( \frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2} \right) = 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

This is incorrect, as the expected value should be \( \frac{7}{3} \), which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 233333336.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation and fails for this case.
