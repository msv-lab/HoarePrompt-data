### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - Each chosen pair of friends increases their friendship value by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The final answer should be in the form \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function calculates the sum of the product of each friendship value `f` and the triangular number of `k` (which is \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \)), modulo `MOD`.
     - The triangular number \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the total increase in friendship value over `k` excursions if a pair is chosen.
     - The function sums this product for all `m` pairs of friends and returns the result modulo `MOD`.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.
     - It calls `func_1` with the read parameters and prints the result.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **`func_1`**:
     - The function correctly calculates the sum of the product of each friendship value `f` and the triangular number of `k`.
     - However, it does not account for the probability of choosing a pair of friends, which is crucial for calculating the expected value.
     - The expected value of the sum of friendship values should consider the probability of each pair being chosen, which is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) for each pair.
   - **`func_2`**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair chosen should be \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \times \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
   - The function `func_1` does not include the probability \( \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \), which is necessary for the expected value calculation.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the excursions because it lacks the probability component in the calculation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
