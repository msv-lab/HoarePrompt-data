### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the program's approach to calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The program's logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion. Instead, it simply multiplies the initial friendship value by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is incorrect.

To correctly calculate the expected value, we need to consider the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion. The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in any given excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` children. This is equal to \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).

For each friendship pair, the expected increase in the friendship value over `k` excursions can be calculated as follows:
- The initial friendship value is `f`.
- The expected increase in the friendship value per excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
- Over `k` excursions, the expected increase in the friendship value is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

Thus, the expected value of the sum of friendship values for a specific pair over `k` excursions is:
\[ f + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Summing this over all `m` pairs of friends gives the total expected value:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

The program, however, calculates:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i \times \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \right) \]

This is clearly incorrect because it does not consider the probability of each pair being chosen.

### Example Case Revisited:
For the input:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
- There are 3 children, so \( \binom{3}{2} = 3 \) possible pairs.
- The probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) in each excursion is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The expected value of the sum of friendship values over the 2 excursions is:
\[ E = \left( \frac{1}{3} \times (1 + 2) \right) + \left( \frac{2}{3} \times (1 + 1) \right) = \frac{1}{3} \times 3 + \frac{2}{3} \times 2 = 1 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{7}{3} \]

The correct result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is:
\[ \left( \frac{7}{3} \right) \times 3 \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 7 \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 7 \]

However, the program calculates:
\[ 1 \times \left( \frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2} \right) = 1 \times 3 = 3 \]

This is indeed incorrect, as the expected value should be \( \frac{7}{3} \), which modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 7.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values.

Final: **False**
