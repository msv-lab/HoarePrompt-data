### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Structure**:
   - The program initializes `pergunta` to `float('inf')`, which is a good starting point for finding the minimum value.
   - The loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` in reverse order, which is appropriate because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - Inside the loop, the program checks if the current index `i` is less than `m`. If it is, it updates `pergunta` to the minimum of its current value and `x + a[i]`. This is correct because it ensures that Kirill only considers positions `j` such that `j < i` and `j < m`, which aligns with the problem's requirement that Kirill should be among the first `m` people.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program updates `x` by adding the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to it. This is correct because:
     - If Kirill moves to position `i`, he will pay `a[i]` to the person at position `i`.
     - For each position `k` between `i` and the current position, he will pay `b[k]` coins.
     - By taking the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]`, the program ensures that Kirill is paying the least possible amount to move to position `i`.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints `pergunta`, which is the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `n == m`, Kirill doesn't need to move, and the program will correctly output the minimum cost.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. The loop structure, condition checks, and cost calculations are all aligned with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
