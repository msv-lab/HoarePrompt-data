The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list `test_cases` of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and two strings of length `n` with characters '<' and '>'. The function returns a list `results` with 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row in the grid. The initial variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
