Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The amount received back for the i-th winning outcome is `x_i * k_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the i-th outcome and `k_i` is the multiplier for that outcome.
   - We need to ensure that for all `i`, `sum(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) < x_i * k_i`.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The multipliers `k_i` are integers between 2 and 20.
   - The number of outcomes `n` is between 1 and 50.
   - The number of test cases `t` can be up to 10^4.

3. **Solution Strategy**:
   - The strategy is to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` to find a common base for the bets.
   - Each bet `x_i` is set to `LCM // k_i`.
   - The total sum of bets should be less than the LCM to ensure the condition is met.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(a, b)**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `LCM(a, b) = abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)`.
   - **func_2(numbers)**: This function correctly calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to the list.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, calculate the LCM of the multipliers `k_i` using `func_2`.
   - Compute the bets `x_i` as `LCM // k_i` for each outcome.
   - Check if the total sum of bets `sum(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` is less than the LCM.
   - If the sum is less than the LCM, print the bets. Otherwise, print `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same, the LCM will be that number, and the total sum of bets will be `n * (LCM // k_i)`. If `n * (LCM // k_i) >= LCM`, it is impossible to satisfy the condition, and we return `-1`.
   - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be larger, and we can always find a distribution that satisfies the condition.

7. **Code Implementation**:
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the LCM of the multipliers.
   - The main logic to distribute the coins and check the condition is implemented correctly:
     - The LCM is calculated using `func_2(k)`.
     - The bets are computed as `m // k[i]` for each outcome.
     - The sum of bets is checked against the LCM.
     - If the sum is less than the LCM, the bets are printed; otherwise, `-1` is printed.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution strategy and handles all edge cases as described. Therefore, the program as a whole is correct.

Final: **True**
