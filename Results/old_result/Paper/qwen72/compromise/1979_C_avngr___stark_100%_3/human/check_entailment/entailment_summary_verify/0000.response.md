### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct. The provided program does not solve the problem as described. The problem requires a function that determines how to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. However, the provided program only contains two helper functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which compute the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers. The program lacks the main function that would use these helpers to solve the problem.

Let's break down the requirements and the provided code:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - For each test case, you need to determine how to distribute coins such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - If no such distribution exists, output `-1`.

2. **Provided Code**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - `func_2(numbers)`: Computes the LCM of a list of integers by sequentially applying `func_1`.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - `func_2` returns the LCM of the list `numbers`.

The LCM of the multipliers `k_i` is not directly relevant to the problem of distributing coins. The problem requires a strategy to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome. The provided functions do not address this requirement.

### Example Analysis

Consider the example input:
```
1
3
3 2 7
```

The expected output should be:
```
27 41 12
```

However, the provided program does not produce any output for this input because it lacks the main function to process the input and generate the required output. The LCM of the multipliers `[3, 2, 7]` is `42`, but this value alone does not help in determining the bets.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem, you would need to:
1. Determine the total amount of coins bet.
2. Ensure that for each outcome, the return is strictly greater than the total amount of coins bet.

A possible approach is to:
1. Calculate the total amount of coins bet as the sum of the bets.
2. For each outcome, ensure that the bet on that outcome multiplied by its multiplier is greater than the total amount of coins bet.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem. It lacks the main function to process the input and generate the required output. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **False**
