### Reasoning:

The problem requires us to distribute coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This means that for each outcome \(i\), the bet \(x_i\) should satisfy the condition:

\[ \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \]

for all \(i\).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It is used to find the LCM of all the multipliers \(k_i\) in the list `numbers`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of integers `numbers` by sequentially applying `func_1`.
   - The result is the LCM of all the multipliers \(k_i\).

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.
   - It calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as \( \text{LCM} // k_i \).
   - If the sum of all bets is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets for each outcome.

### Verification:

- **LCM Calculation**:
  - The LCM of the multipliers is calculated to ensure that the bets are consistent across all outcomes.
  - This is a good approach because the LCM will be a common multiple of all \(k_i\), making it easier to distribute the bets.

- **Bet Calculation**:
  - The bet for each outcome is calculated as \( \text{LCM} // k_i \).
  - This ensures that the bet is an integer and is proportional to the multiplier \(k_i\).

- **Sum Check**:
  - The program checks if the sum of all bets is strictly less than the LCM.
  - If the sum is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1` because it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - \( n = 3 \)
  - \( k = [3, 2, 7] \)
  - LCM of 3, 2, 7 is 42.
  - Bets are \( 42 // 3 = 14 \), \( 42 // 2 = 21 \), \( 42 // 7 = 6 \).
  - Sum of bets is \( 14 + 21 + 6 = 41 \), which is less than 42.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - \( n = 2 \)
  - \( k = [3, 3] \)
  - LCM of 3, 3 is 3.
  - Bets are \( 3 // 3 = 1 \), \( 3 // 3 = 1 \).
  - Sum of bets is \( 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is less than 3.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - \( n = 5 \)
  - \( k = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5] \)
  - LCM of 5, 5, 5, 5, 5 is 5.
  - Bets are \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \), \( 5 // 5 = 1 \).
  - Sum of bets is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 \), which is equal to 5.
  - This is incorrect, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - \( n = 6 \)
  - \( k = [7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13] \)
  - LCM of 7, 9, 3, 17, 9, 13 is 4641.
  - Bets are \( 4641 // 7 = 663 \), \( 4641 // 9 = 515 \), \( 4641 // 3 = 1547 \), \( 4641 // 17 = 273 \), \( 4641 // 9 = 515 \), \( 4641 // 13 = 357 \).
  - Sum of bets is \( 663 + 515 + 1547 + 273 + 515 + 357 = 4470 \), which is less than 4641.
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 5**:
  - \( n = 3 \)
  - \( k = [6, 3, 2] \)
  - LCM of 6, 3, 2 is 6.
  - Bets are \( 6 // 6 = 1 \), \( 6 // 3 = 2 \), \( 6 // 2 = 3 \).
  - Sum of bets is \( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \), which is equal to 6.
  - This is incorrect, and the program correctly prints `-1`.

- **Test Case 6**:
  - \( n = 5 \)
  - \( k = [9, 4, 6, 8, 3] \)
  - LCM of 9, 4, 6, 8, 3 is 72.
  - Bets are \( 72 // 9 = 8 \), \( 72 // 4 = 18 \), \( 72 // 6 = 12 \), \( 72 // 8 = 9 \), \( 72 // 3 = 24 \).
  - Sum of bets is \( 8 + 18 + 12 + 9 + 24 = 71 \), which is less than 72.
  - This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. It handles all edge cases, including when no valid distribution is possible.
