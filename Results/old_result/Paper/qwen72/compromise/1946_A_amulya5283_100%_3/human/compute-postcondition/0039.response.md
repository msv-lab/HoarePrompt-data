To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

1. **Current State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `n` is an input integer such that `mdx` is less than `n`.
   - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input.
   - `i` is `mdx + 1`.
   - If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

2. **Loop Head:**
   ```python
   for i in range(mdx, n):
   ```

3. **Adjustments:**
   - The loop head specifies that `i` should start from `mdx` and go up to `n - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `mdx + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `mdx + 2`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **New State:**
   - `i` is `mdx + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2` for the loop to execute one more time.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that `mdx` is less than `n`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 1 or 2. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
