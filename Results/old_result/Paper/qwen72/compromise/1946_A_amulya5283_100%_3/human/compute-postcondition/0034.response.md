Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that `mdx` is less than `n`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, the element at index `mdx` in the list `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in the list `a`, `res` is 1.** 

The value of `res` is incremented by 1, so `res` is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
