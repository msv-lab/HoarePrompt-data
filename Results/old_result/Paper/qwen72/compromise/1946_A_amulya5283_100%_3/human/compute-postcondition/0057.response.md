The only objects in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop increments `i` and the conditions under which the loop continues to execute.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is 3
- `n` is greater than 0
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input
- `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
- `i` is `mdx`
- If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration.
- The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given that `i` is `mdx` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be `mdx + 1`
- `n` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 1. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.**
