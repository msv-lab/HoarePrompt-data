To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head and the conditions required for the loop to start and run at least once.

The loop head is:
```
for i in range(mdx, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `mdx`
- `n`

For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(mdx, n)` must contain at least one element. This means that `n` must be greater than `mdx`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is 3 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input (not relevant to the loop head)
- `res` is 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`

Let's break down the condition for the loop to execute:
1. `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `mdx`.

Let's analyze the value of `mdx`:
- If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx = n // 2 - 1`.
- If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx = n // 2`.

To ensure the loop executes at least once:
- If `n` is even, `n > n // 2 - 1` must be true.
- If `n` is odd, `n > n // 2` must be true.

Both conditions are always true for any positive integer `n`. However, if `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute because `range(mdx, n)` will be empty.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. The variable `i` will start at `mdx` and `mdx` is derived from `n`.

State: **`t` is 3, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is 0, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`**
