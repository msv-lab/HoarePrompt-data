The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial state specifies that `res` is 1 if the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, otherwise `res` is 0. After the code execution, `res` will be 2 if the elements at the specified indices are equal, and 1 if they are not.

Output State: **`t` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`. If the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**
