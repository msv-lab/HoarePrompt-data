Output State: **`t` is an input integer - 2 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `a` to a list of integers obtained from the input.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, so after the code execution, `a` is still a sorted list of integers, but now it is explicitly defined by the new input.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, so they retain their initial conditions.
- The output state reflects these changes and maintains the conditions that were true in the initial state.
