Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer such that `mdx` is less than `n`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, and `res` is 0 unless the element at index `mdx` in the list `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in the list `a`, in which case `res` is 1.***
