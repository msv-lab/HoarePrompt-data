Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer - 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided in the input, `res` is 0 or 1, or if `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is 1 or 2 or 3, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, and `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is updated to 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `res` remains 0 or 1.***
