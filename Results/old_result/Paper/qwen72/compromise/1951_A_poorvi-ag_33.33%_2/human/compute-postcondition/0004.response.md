The only object in the loop head is the variable `r` and the list `results`. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. The variable `r` will take the value of the first element in `results` at the start of the loop.

State: **`results` is a list containing 'yes' or 'no' strings based on the input conditions for each iteration, and the length of `results` must be at least 1, `r` is the first element in `results`**
