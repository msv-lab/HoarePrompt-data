The function reads an integer `t` from the user, then for each of the `t` iterations, it reads another integer `n` and a string `arr`. It checks if the string `arr` contains exactly two '1's and if '11' is a substring, appending 'no' to the `results` list. If the string `arr` contains an even number of '1's but does not contain '11' as a substring, it appends 'yes' to the `results` list. Otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all iterations, it prints each element in the `results` list. The function does not modify the values of `start`, `end`, or the current directory contents.
