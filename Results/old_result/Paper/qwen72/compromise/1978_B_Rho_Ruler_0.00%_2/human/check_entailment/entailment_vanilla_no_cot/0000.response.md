Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is used in a binary search to find the maximum profit, but the binary search and the function itself are not correctly formulated for this problem.

Here's a detailed explanation of the issues:

1. **Binary Search Misapplication**: The binary search is being used to find a value of `k` that satisfies a condition, but the condition being checked (`ans <= n * max(a, b)`) is not relevant to finding the maximum profit. The goal is to maximize the profit, not to find a `k` that makes the profit less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.

2. **Profit Calculation in `func_1`**: The profit calculation in `func_1` is incorrect. It should calculate the profit for a given `k` and return the maximum profit, not a boolean value.

3. **Output of the Program**: The program prints the value of `ans`, which is the last `k` that satisfies the condition in `func_1`. However, `ans` should be the maximum profit, not the value of `k`.

A correct approach would be to calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` and choose the maximum profit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This program iterates over all possible values of `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and calculates the profit for each value. It then prints the maximum profit found.

For large values of `n` and `b`, this approach can be optimized to avoid the sum calculation in each iteration, but the basic logic is correct. Here is an optimized version:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(n, b)
            profit = (b * (b + 1) // 2) - ((b - k) * (b - k + 1) // 2) + (n - k) * a
            print(profit)
```

This optimized version directly calculates the profit for the optimal `k` without iterating over all possible values, making it more efficient.
