### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Bob can sell `n` buns.
   - The usual price of a bun is `a` coins.
   - Bob can choose to sell the first `k` buns at a modified price, where the price of the `i`-th bun (1 ≤ i ≤ k) is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The remaining `(n - k)` buns are sold at `a` coins each.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The program uses a binary search to determine the optimal value of `k`.
   - The binary search is performed on the range `[0, n]`.
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if a given `k` is valid.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the total profit if `k` buns are sold at the modified price and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` is:
     ```python
     def func_1(k, a, b, n):
         ans = 0
         ans += k * b
         ans += (n - k) * a
         return ans <= n * max(a, b)
     ```
   - This implementation is incorrect because:
     - It calculates the profit from the first `k` buns as `k * b`, which is not the correct formula for the modified price.
     - The correct formula for the profit from the first `k` buns should be the sum of the series `(b + (b-1) + ... + (b-k+1))`, which is `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - It should return `True` if the total profit is greater than or equal to the profit obtained by selling all buns at the usual price, not less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`.

4. **Correct Implementation of `func_1`**:
   - The correct implementation should be:
     ```python
     def func_1(k, a, b, n):
         profit_modified = k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2
         profit_usual = (n - k) * a
         total_profit = profit_modified + profit_usual
         return total_profit >= n * a
     ```

5. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search updates `low` and `high` based on the result of `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it means the current `k` is valid, and we try to increase `k` by setting `low = mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `False`, it means the current `k` is too large, and we try to decrease `k` by setting `high = mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum valid `k` found by the binary search.
   - However, the program is designed to print `ans`, which is the maximum valid `k` that satisfies the condition in `func_1`. This is not the correct output. The output should be the maximum profit, not the value of `k`.

7. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implemented, as explained above.
   - The program prints `ans`, which is the maximum valid `k`, instead of the maximum profit.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect, which will lead to incorrect results in the binary search.
   - The program outputs the wrong value (`k` instead of the maximum profit).
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
