Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` is used in a binary search, but it does not correctly calculate the profit for a given `k`. The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not the correct way to determine if a given `k` is optimal. The correct approach should be to calculate the profit for each possible `k` and choose the maximum profit.

A correct implementation would involve calculating the profit for each `k` from 0 to `min(n, b)` and selecting the maximum profit. The current implementation does not handle this correctly and may return an incorrect result for certain inputs.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 4 5
```
The program should output `17` (as explained in the problem description), but the current implementation may not return this value due to the incorrect logic in `func_1` and the binary search.
