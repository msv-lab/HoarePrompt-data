The only variables in the loop head are `ii` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `ii` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Since the state before the loop starts includes `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`, we need to ensure that the input value is consistent with `t`, which is the number of test cases. The input value should be equal to `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, and `int(input())` must be equal to `t`**
