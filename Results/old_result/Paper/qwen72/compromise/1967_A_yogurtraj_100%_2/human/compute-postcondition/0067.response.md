Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `y` is updated accordingly.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its previous value.
- `i` is `n - 2`, so the expression `(i + 1)` simplifies to `n - 1`.
- The value of `a[i + 1] - a[i]` is the difference between the `i + 1`-th element and the `i`-th element in the sorted list `a`.
- Therefore, `k` is updated to `k - (n - 1) * (a[n - 1] - a[n - 2])`.
- The states of `t`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- `y` is mentioned as being updated, but the specific update rule is not provided, so it is included in the output state as "updated accordingly."
