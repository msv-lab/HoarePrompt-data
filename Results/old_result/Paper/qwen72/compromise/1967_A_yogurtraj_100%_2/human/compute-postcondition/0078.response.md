Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % n`, `y` is 0, and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.***
