Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is `a[i + 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `y` is 0, and ((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) is less than or equal to the new value of `k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `a[i + 1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `ii`, `i`, `rem`, `a`, `n`, `k`, `y`) remain unchanged.
- The condition `((i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])) is less than or equal to the new value of `k`` still holds true.
