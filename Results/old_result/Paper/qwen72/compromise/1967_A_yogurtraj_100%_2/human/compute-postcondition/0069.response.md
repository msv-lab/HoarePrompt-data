Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 2. If `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`, then `k` is 0, `y` is 1, `r` is `a[n - 2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `y` is updated accordingly, and `r` is `a[i + 1]`.***
