Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is `a[i] + k // (i + 1)`, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `y` is 0, and the current value of `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` is greater than `k`.**

The value of `rem` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`, which is the remainder when `k` is divided by `i + 1`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
