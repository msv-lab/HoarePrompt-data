Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `y` is the number of elements in the list `a` that were not processed in the loop, `rem` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[0]`.**

The code snippet `rem = 0` sets the variable `rem` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
