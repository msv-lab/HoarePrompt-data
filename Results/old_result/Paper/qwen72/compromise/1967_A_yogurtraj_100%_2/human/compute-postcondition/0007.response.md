To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(0, n - 1):
```

The variables in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `n`

The loop will execute if the range `0` to `n - 1` is non-empty, which means `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than `1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `ii` is 0
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user
- `r` is the first element of the list `a`
- `rem` is 0
- `y` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is initialized to 0 (which is already the case).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0**
