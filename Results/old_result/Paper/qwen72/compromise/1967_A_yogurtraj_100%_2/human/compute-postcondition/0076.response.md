Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is now `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated by subtracting `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])` from its current value.
- `i` is `n - 1`, so `i + 1` is `n`.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers, and the expression `a[i + 1] - a[i]` calculates the difference between the `i + 1`-th element and the `i`-th element of the list `a`.
- The new value of `k` is `k - n * (a[n] - a[n - 1])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
