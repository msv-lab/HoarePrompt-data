Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 0, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer input by the user, `y` is 0, `rem` is `k % 1`, `r` is `a[0] + k // 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `rem` is updated to `k % (i + 1)`. Since `i` is 0, `i + 1` is 1, and `k % 1` is always 0 for any integer `k`.
- The value of `r` remains `a[0] + k // 1`, which is `a[0] + k` since integer division by 1 does not change the value of `k`.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `ii`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `y`) remain unchanged.
