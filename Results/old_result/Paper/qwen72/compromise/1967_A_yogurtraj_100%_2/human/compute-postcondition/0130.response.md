The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts multiple inputs. It likely accepts `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts `n` and `k`, which are integers, and `a`, which is a list of integers. The constraints are as follows: `1 <= t <= 100`, `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `0 <= k <= 10^12`, and `1 <= a_i <= 10^12` for each element `a_i` in the list `a`.

The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints. Given the context, it is reasonable to infer that the function returns some value or values based on the inputs `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k`, and a list of integers `a`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
