Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is `k % 2`, and `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`. Given that `i` is 1, `i + 1` is 2, so `rem` is `k % 2`.
- All other variables (`a`, `t`, `ii`, `i`, `n`, `y`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial values.
