Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `y` is 0, `rem` is 0, and `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `a[1] + k // 2`.
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers input by the user.
- `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- `ii` remains 2.
- `i` remains 1.
- `n` remains the first integer input by the user and must be greater than 1.
- `y` remains 0.
- `rem` remains 0.
