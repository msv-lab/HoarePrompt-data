Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the third element of the list `a`, `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to the third element of the list `a` (since `i` is 2, `a[i + 1]` is `a[3]`).
- The value of `k` is updated to `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, which simplifies to `k - 3 * (a[3] - a[2])`.
- All other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `i`, `rem`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
