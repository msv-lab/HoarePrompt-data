Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `rem` is `k % 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is `a[1] + k // 2`, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 2`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is set to 0.
- `rem` is now `0 % 2`, which is 0.
- `r` is now `a[1] + 0 // 2`, which simplifies to `a[1]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `ii`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `y`) remain unchanged.
