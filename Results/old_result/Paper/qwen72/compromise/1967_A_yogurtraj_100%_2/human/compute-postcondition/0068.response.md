Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is `k - (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])`, `y` is updated accordingly, `r` is `a[i + 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `r = a[i + 1]` assigns the value of `a[i + 1]` to the variable `r`.
- Since `i` is `n - 2`, `i + 1` is `n - 1`.
- Therefore, `r` is assigned the value of `a[n - 1]`, which is the second-to-last element in the list `a`.
- All other variables (`t`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `n`, `k`, and `y`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
