Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `r` is the first element of the list `a`, `rem` is 0, `y` is 0, `i` is 0, and the difference between the (i + 1)-th element and the i-th element of the list `a` multiplied by (i + 1) is less than or equal to `k`.**
