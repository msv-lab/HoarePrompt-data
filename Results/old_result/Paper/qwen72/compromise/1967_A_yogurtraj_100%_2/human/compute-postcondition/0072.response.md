Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than 2, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`, `rem` is `k % n`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `rem` is assigned the value of `k % (i + 1)`.
- Since `i` is `n - 1`, `i + 1` is `n`.
- Therefore, `rem` is `k % n`.
- The values of the other variables (`t`, `ii`, `i`, `a`, `n`, `r`) remain unchanged.
