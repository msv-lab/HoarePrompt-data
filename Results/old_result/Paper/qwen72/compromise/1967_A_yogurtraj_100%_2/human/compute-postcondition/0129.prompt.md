Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n and k are integers for each test case where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^12.
Code of the loop:
for ii in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    r = a[0]
    rem = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(0, n - 1):
        if (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k:
            r = a[i] + k // (i + 1)
            rem = k % (i + 1)
            y = n - 1 - i
            k = 0
            break
        else:
            k -= (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i])
            r = a[i + 1]
    if k != 0:
        r = a[n - 1] + k // n
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + k % n)
    else:
        print((r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n - 2`, `rem` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, and `r` is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks or completes. If `k` is not 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a` plus the integer division of `k` by `n`. If the loop breaks, `k` is 0, `y` is `n - 1 - i` (the number of elements remaining in the list after the break), and `rem` is `k % (i + 1)`. If the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the remaining value after all subtractions, and `r` is the last element of the list `a`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last element of the list `a` before the loop breaks or completes, and `k` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 1, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is the number of elements in the list `a` that were not processed in the loop, and `rem` is the remainder of `k` when the loop broke or 0 if the loop completed without breaking. If `k` is not 0, `r` is the value of `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the value of `a[i + 1]` at the last iteration where the loop did not break.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `n` is the first integer input by the user, `y` is the number of elements in `a` that were not processed due to the loop breaking, `rem` is the remainder of `k` when divided by the last processed index + 1. If `k` is not 0, `r` is `a[n - 1] + k // n`. If `k` is 0, `r` is the last processed element in `a` or the result of `a[last_processed_index] + (k - (last_processed_index + 1) * (a[last_processed_index + 1] - a[last_processed_index])) // (last_processed_index + 1)` if the loop broke due to the condition `(i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
