Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user.** 

The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `ii` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, and the first integer in the input is equal to `t`. The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into multiple parts based on spaces, converts each part to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `ii`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, but `a` now holds the list of integers provided by the user.
