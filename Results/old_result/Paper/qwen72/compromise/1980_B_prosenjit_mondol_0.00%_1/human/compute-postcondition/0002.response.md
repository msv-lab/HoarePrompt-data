The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `f`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `n` is the number of cubes, `f` is the index of Dmitry's favorite cube, `k` is the number of cubes to be removed, and `a` is a list of integers representing the values shown on the cubes. The constraints are: 1 <= t <= 1000, 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and 1 <= a_i <= 100.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function determines whether it is possible to remove exactly `k` cubes such that Dmitry's favorite cube remains. If it is possible, the function returns "Yes" for that test case; otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains four elements: `n` (number of cubes), `f` (index of Dmitry's favorite cube), `k` (number of cubes to be removed), and `a` (list of integers representing the values on the cubes). The function returns a list of strings, where each string is "Yes" if it is possible to remove exactly `k` cubes while keeping Dmitry's favorite cube, or "No" otherwise.**
