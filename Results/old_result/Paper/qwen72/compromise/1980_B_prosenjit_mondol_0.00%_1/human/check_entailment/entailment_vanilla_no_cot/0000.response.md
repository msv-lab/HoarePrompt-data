Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in the condition where it checks if the favorite cube will be removed. Specifically, the condition `if a[k] > x:` and `elif a[k] < x:` are not sufficient to determine the outcome correctly in all cases. The program incorrectly assumes that if the value of the favorite cube is equal to the value of the k-th cube after sorting, it should check the previous element to decide whether the favorite cube will be removed. However, this does not account for all possible scenarios where the favorite cube could be in the removed section or not.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, f, k) = map(int, input().split())
        f -= 1
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = a[f]
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        
        # Check if the favorite cube's value is among the first k cubes after sorting
        if a[k-1] > x:
            print('NO')
        elif a[k-1] < x:
            print('YES')
        else:
            # If the value is the same, check if the favorite cube could be in the first k cubes
            count = a.count(x)
            if a.index(x) < k or (a.index(x) == k and count > 1):
                print('YES')
            elif a.index(x) >= k and count == 1:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('MAYBE')
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup**: The program reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k`, and the list of cube values `a`.
2. **Favorite Cube Value**: It stores the value of the favorite cube in `x`.
3. **Sorting**: It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
4. **Check Conditions**:
   - If the value of the k-th cube (after sorting) is greater than `x`, the favorite cube will not be removed.
   - If the value of the k-th cube is less than `x`, the favorite cube will be removed.
   - If the value of the k-th cube is equal to `x`, it needs to determine if the favorite cube is among the first `k` cubes:
     - It counts the number of cubes with the value `x`.
     - If the index of the first occurrence of `x` is less than `k`, or if the index is exactly `k` and there are multiple cubes with the value `x`, the favorite cube will be removed.
     - If the index of the first occurrence of `x` is greater than or equal to `k` and there is only one cube with the value `x`, the favorite cube will not be removed.
     - Otherwise, it prints "MAYBE".

This corrected version should handle all the cases correctly as described in the problem statement.
