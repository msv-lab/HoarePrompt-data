The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list `cases` which contains `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `t` is such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. The string `s` has a length of `n` and contains only the characters "U" and "D".

Functionality: **The function returns a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters "U" and "D".**
