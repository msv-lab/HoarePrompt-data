You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the number of models `m`, and the number of functions `k`.
   - It then reads the complexities of the prepared problems `A`, the models `D`, and the functions `F`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` to keep track of the largest and second-largest differences between consecutive elements in `A`.

3. **Finding the Largest Difference:**
   - The program iterates through the array `A` to find the largest difference `max_diff` and the index `index` where this difference occurs.
   - It also keeps track of the second-largest difference `next_max_diff`.

4. **Binary Search for Optimal Insertion:**
   - The program uses binary search to find the optimal position to insert a new problem complexity `D[mid] + f` between `left` and `right` (where `left = A[index - 1]` and `right = A[index]`).
   - It calculates the potential new differences and updates `ans` to the minimum possible imbalance.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum imbalance, which is the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the largest and second-largest differences in the array `A`.
- It uses binary search to efficiently find the optimal position to insert a new problem complexity, ensuring that the new problem minimizes the imbalance.
- The logic for updating `ans` and handling the binary search is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

### Potential Issues:
- The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. This is unnecessary and can be removed.
- The function `wrapper` is defined but not used in the program. This is also unnecessary and can be removed.
- The function `func_5` is defined but not used in the program. This is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and follows the problem's requirements. However, it contains unused functions that can be removed for clarity and efficiency.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
