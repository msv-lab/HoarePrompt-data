Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is less than `h`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet assigns the values `D[mid] + f` to `mid_sum` and `D[mid + 1] + f` to `mid_next_sum`.
- `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`.
- `mid` is calculated as `l + (h - l) // 2`, where `l` is less than `h`.
- `f` is an element from the list `F` returned by `func_4()`.
- All other variables (`A`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `i`, `diff`, `left`, `right`, `ans`, `l`, `h`, `mid`) remain unchanged.
- `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` are updated based on the values in `D` and `f`.
