Output State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `func_6()` has been called `testcases` times.**

This means that after the loop has completed all its iterations, the variable `testcases` must still be greater than 0, and the function `func_6()` will have been called a total number of times equal to the initial value of `testcases`.
