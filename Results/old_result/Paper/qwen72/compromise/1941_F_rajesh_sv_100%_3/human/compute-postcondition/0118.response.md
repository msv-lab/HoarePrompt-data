The function `func_6` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are integers, and lists `A`, `D`, and `F`. The constraints are as follows: `2 <= n <= 10^5`, `1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5`, and `1 <= k <= 2 * 10^5`. `A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, where `1 <= A[i] <= 2 * 10^9`. `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from a list of `m` integers, where `1 <= D[i] <= 10^9`. `F` is a list of `k` integers, where `1 <= F[i] <= 10^9`.

The function returns a result based on the processing of these parameters and lists, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_6` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and the lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with the specified constraints, and return a result based on the processing of these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with the specified constraints and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
