Output State: **`mid_sum` is `D[l] + F[1]`, `mid_next_sum` is undefined because `mid + 1` is not within the bounds of `D`, `l` is the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - F[2]`, `h` is the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` or -1 if no such element exists, `mid` is equal to `l`, `ans` is the minimum of the previous `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + F[1] - left` and `right - D[l] - F[1]`, and `f` is `F[2]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to the index of the last element in `D` that is less than or equal to `right - F[2]` or -1 if no such element exists. This is achieved by using the `bisect_left` function, which finds the insertion point for `right - F[2]` in the sorted list `D` and subtracting 1 from it.
- All other variables (`mid_sum`, `mid_next_sum`, `l`, `mid`, `ans`, and `f`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values.
