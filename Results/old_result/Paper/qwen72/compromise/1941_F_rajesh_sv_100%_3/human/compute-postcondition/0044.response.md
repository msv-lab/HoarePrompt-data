Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, `n` is the length of `A` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers returned by `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between any two consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` that follows the largest difference, `i` is `n - 1`, `diff` is the difference between the last two elements in `A`, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `l` is the index in `D` where the value `left - F[0]` should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of `D`, `h` is now `mid`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + F[0]`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + F[0]`, and `(mid_sum - left >= right - mid_next_sum)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `h` is updated to `mid`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
