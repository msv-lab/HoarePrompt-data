Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 1000. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements). `pos` is a list with one element, which is the value `s - 2 * s2`. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements`.**
