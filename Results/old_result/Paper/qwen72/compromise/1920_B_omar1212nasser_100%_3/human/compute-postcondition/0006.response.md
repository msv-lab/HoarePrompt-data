Output State: **The program returns the maximum value from the list `pos`, which has `removals + 1` elements. The last element of `pos` is calculated as `s - 2 * s2`, where `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements` except the last `removals` integers, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` integers in `elements` after the first `removals` integers have been removed. The other elements in `pos` are not specified but are part of the list.**
