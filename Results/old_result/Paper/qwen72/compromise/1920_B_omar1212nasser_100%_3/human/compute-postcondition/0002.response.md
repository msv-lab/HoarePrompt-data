Output State: **`elements` is a list of integers where 1 <= len(elements) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 1000. `removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= removals, negatives <= len(elements). `pos` is a list with one element, which is the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`. `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a single value to the list `pos`.
- The value appended is `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`.
- `s` is the sum of all integers in `elements`.
- `elements[-negatives:]` is the sublist of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.
- `sum(elements[-negatives:])` is the sum of these last `negatives` elements.
- The value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` is calculated and appended to `pos`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
