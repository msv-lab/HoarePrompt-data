Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is an empty list, `d` is an empty dictionary, `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, for all integers in `palka` whose count is greater than or equal to 3.
Code of the loop:
for i in palka:
    if d.get(i) == None:
        d[i] = 1
    else:
        d[i] += 1
    if i not in pl:
        pl.append(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `i` is not in `pl`, `i` is added to `pl`, and `d[i]` is incremented by 1 (set to 1 if it was initially `None`). `shapes` is the sum of the integer division of the count of each unique integer in `palka` by 3, for all integers in `palka` whose count is greater than or equal to 3. If `i` is already in `pl`, the state remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `i` is not in `pl`, `d[i]` is set to 1 and `i` is added to `pl`. If `d[i]` was already in `d`, `d[i]` is incremented by 1 and `shapes` remains unchanged. `pl` now includes `i` as an additional element if `i` was not already in `pl`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with `i` as a key. If `d.get(i) == None`, `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. In both cases, `pl` now includes the third element in `palka` as an additional element if it was not already in `pl`, and `shapes` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
