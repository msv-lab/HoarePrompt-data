Output State: **The loop has completed all `w` iterations, and for each iteration, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3. The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed `w` times, the following conditions hold true:
- The loop has run the exact number of times specified by `w`.
- For each iteration, `ln` is an integer input by the user, and `palka` is a list of integers of length `ln` also input by the user.
- `d` is a dictionary that keeps track of the count of each unique integer in `palka` for each iteration.
- `pl` is a list that contains all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared in each iteration.
- `shapes` is calculated for each iteration as the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `w` remain unchanged from their initial values.
