Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element, `shapes` is 0, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`, `j` is the first element of `pl` and the count of `j` in `palka` (i.e., `d[j]`) is at least 3, the variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.**
