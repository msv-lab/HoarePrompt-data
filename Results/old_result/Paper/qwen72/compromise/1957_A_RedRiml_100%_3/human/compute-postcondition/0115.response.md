Postcondition: **`d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 2 elements, `shapes` is 0 if `d[j]` is less than 3, otherwise `shapes` is the original value of `shapes` plus `d[j] // 3`, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`, `j` is the second element of `pl`, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `w`, and `ln` remain unchanged.**
