Output State: **`d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and value 1, `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer and must be at least 1, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `pl` is an empty list, `shapes` is the sum of the integer divisions of the counts of all unique integers in `palka` that appear 3 or more times by 3, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than `w`, `i` is the first element of `palka`.**
