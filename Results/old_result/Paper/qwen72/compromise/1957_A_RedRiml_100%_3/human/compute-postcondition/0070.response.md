Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have `ln` elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and each value is the count of that integer in `palka`, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `pl`, `shapes` is 0, and the count of `j` in `palka` (i.e., `d[j]`) is 3 or more.**
