Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100, w is an input integer.** 

The value of `w` is assigned the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
