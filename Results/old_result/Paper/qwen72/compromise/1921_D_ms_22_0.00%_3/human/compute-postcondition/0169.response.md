Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is the final index of the first element in `b` that was considered, `tp2` is the final index of the last element in `b` that was considered, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code `b.sort()` sorts the list `b` in ascending order.
- The values of `max_heap`, `ans`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged.
- The list `b` is now sorted, which means its elements are in non-decreasing order.
