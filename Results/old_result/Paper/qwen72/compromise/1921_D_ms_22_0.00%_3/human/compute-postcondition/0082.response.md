To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- `max_heap` is empty.
- `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop.
- `tp1` and `tp2` have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop.

### Analysis:
1. **`max_heap` is empty**: This indicates that no elements have been added to the max heap.
2. **`ans` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop**: This suggests that `ans` is a variable that accumulates the sum of absolute differences. However, since `max_heap` is empty, it implies that the loop has not run, or no elements have been processed to contribute to `ans`.
3. **`tp1` and `tp2` have been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop**: This indicates that `tp1` and `tp2` are variables that are modified during the loop. However, since the loop has not run (due to `max_heap` being empty), `tp1` and `tp2` have not been adjusted.

### Conclusion:
Since `max_heap` is empty, the loop that would have processed elements and calculated the absolute differences has not run. Therefore, `ans` remains at its initial value, which is typically 0 (assuming it was initialized to 0).

### Output:
Output: **0 (where ans is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop, and since the loop did not run due to max_heap being empty, ans remains 0)**
