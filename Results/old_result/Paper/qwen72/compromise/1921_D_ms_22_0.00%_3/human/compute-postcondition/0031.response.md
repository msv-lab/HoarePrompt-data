Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between the third element of `a` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`. If `diff1` > `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, `max_heap` contains the tuple `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. In both cases, `diff1` and `diff2` retain their relationships as described.***
