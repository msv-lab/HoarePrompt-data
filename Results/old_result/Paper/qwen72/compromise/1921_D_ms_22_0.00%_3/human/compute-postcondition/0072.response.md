Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, `max_heap` now contains `n-2` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. `item` is the tuple with the largest absolute difference that was previously in `max_heap`. `diff1` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp1 + 1` in `b`. `diff2` is the absolute difference between the second element of `item` and the element at index `tp2` in `b`. `tp1` is incremented by 1. `ans` is increased by `diff1`.**
