To determine what will be printed by the `print(ans)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `max_heap` is empty.
   - `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - `tp1` is the final index of the first element in `b` that was considered.
   - `tp2` is the final index of the last element in `b` that was considered.
   - `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `n` and `m` remain the integers provided by the user.
   - `a` remains the list of integers provided by the user with `n` elements.
   - `b` remains the sorted list of integers provided by the user.

2. **Understanding `ans`**:
   - `ans` is calculated as the sum of the maximum absolute differences between each element in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - The closest element in `b` to an element in `a` is determined by the indices `tp1` and `tp2`.

3. **Context**:
   - The exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, but we know that `b` is sorted.
   - The range `[tp1, tp2]` is used to find the closest elements in `b` for each element in `a`.
   - The `max_heap` being empty suggests that it was used in the process of finding the closest elements, but it does not affect the final value of `ans`.

Given this information, the `print(ans)` statement will output the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the specified range `[tp1, tp2]`.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `tp1`, and `tp2` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`)**
