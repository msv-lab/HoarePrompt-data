Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least `n` elements, where `n` is the length of `a`. `max_heap` now contains `n-1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `tp1`, and `item` remain unchanged. `ans` is increased by `diff2`. `tp2` is decreased by 1.** 

In natural language: The list `a` and the heap `max_heap` remain unchanged. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `tp1`, and `item` also remain unchanged. The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `diff2`, and `tp2` is decreased by 1.
