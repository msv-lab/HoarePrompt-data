The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `a` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element of `a`, and `a` must have at least one element for the loop to have executed at all. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must have at least two elements, and `i` will be the second element of `a`.

State: **`max_heap` contains a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1` > `diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`. `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least two elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**
