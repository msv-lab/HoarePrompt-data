Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet sets `ans` to 0, overriding its previous value.
- The values of `max_heap`, `tp1`, `tp2`, `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
- `max_heap` is still an empty list.
- `tp1` is still 0.
- `tp2` is still `m - 1`.
- `t` is still `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0.
- `n` and `m` are still the integers provided by the user.
- `a` is still a list of integers provided by the user.
- `b` is still a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
