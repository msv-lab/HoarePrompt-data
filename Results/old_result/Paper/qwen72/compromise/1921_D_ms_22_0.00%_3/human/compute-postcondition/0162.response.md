Output State: **`max_heap` is empty, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is the final index of the first element in `b` that was considered, `tp2` is the final index of the last element in `b` that was considered, `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` remain the integers provided by the user, `a` remains the list of integers provided by the user with `n` elements, and `b` remains the sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `max_heap` is empty, indicating that all tuples have been processed. The variable `ans` contains the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`. The variables `tp1` and `tp2` represent the final indices in `b` that were considered during the loop's execution, and they have been updated accordingly. The variable `t` is `t - n` and must still be greater than or equal to 0, as specified in the initial state. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, as they are provided by the user. The lists `a` and `b` also remain unchanged, with `a` being a list of `n` integers and `b` being a sorted list of integers.
