Postcondition: ***`max_heap` is a list containing a single tuple, either `(-diff1, i, 0)` if `diff1 > diff2`, or `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` if `diff1 <= diff2`. `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have at least 1 element, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the first element in `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element in `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element in `b`.***
