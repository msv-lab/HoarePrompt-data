Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` has been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

In this state, `tp1` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain as they were before the code execution. The value of `t` is still `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0. The lists `a` and `b` and the integers `n` and `m` are unchanged. The value of `ans` remains the sum of the absolute differences calculated during the loop. The value of `tp2` has been adjusted based on the conditions within the loop, but its specific value is not provided. The `max_heap` remains an empty list.
