Output State: **`max_heap` is an empty list, `ans` is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements in `a` and the closest elements in `b` within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is the final index of the last element in `b` that was considered, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `tp1 = 0` sets the value of `tp1` to 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
