Output State: **`a` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`, `diff2` is now updated to `abs(i - b[m - 1])`, `max_heap` now contains the tuple `(-diff1, i, 0)`, and `diff1` is still greater than `diff2`.**
