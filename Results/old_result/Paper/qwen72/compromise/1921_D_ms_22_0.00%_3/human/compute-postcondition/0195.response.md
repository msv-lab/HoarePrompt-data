The only object in the loop head is `max_heap`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `max_heap` is not empty. Right before the loop, `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`. This means that `max_heap` is not empty as long as `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user**
