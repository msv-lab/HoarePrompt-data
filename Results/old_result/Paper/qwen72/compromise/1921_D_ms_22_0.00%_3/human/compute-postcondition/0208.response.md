Output State: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, and `item[2]` is between `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding the negative of the first element of `item` (i.e., `-item[0]`).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
