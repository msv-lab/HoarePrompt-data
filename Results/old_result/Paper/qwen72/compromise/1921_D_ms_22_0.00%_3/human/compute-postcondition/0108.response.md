Output State: **`max_heap` contains two tuples: if `diff1` > `diff2`, the tuples are `(-diff1, i, 0)` and `(-diff1, i, 0)`. If `diff1` â‰¤ `diff2`, the tuples are `(-diff2, i, m - 1)` and `(-diff2, i, m - 1)`. `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least three elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `i` is the third element of `a`, `diff1` is the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`, and `diff2` is the absolute difference between `i` and the last element of `b`.**

Explanation:
- `diff1` is updated to the absolute difference between `i` and the first element of `b`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
