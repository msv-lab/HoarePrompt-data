Postcondition: ***`max_heap` contains `n - 1` tuples, each representing the maximum absolute difference between an element `i` in `a` and either the first or last element in `b`, along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (0 or `m - 1`). `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the negative of the first element of `item`. `tp1` is updated to 1 if `item[2]` is `tp1` (0); otherwise, `tp1` remains 0 and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2`. `t` is `t - n` and must be greater than or equal to 0. `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have `n` elements, `b` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user. `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap`, and the index of the element in `b` within `item` (i.e., `item[2]`) is between the updated `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, but `item[2]` is not equal to the original `tp1` if the else part executed.***
