Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `max_heap` is a list containing `n` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)` where `diff` is the absolute difference between the element `i` from `a` and either the first or last element of `b` (depending on which difference is larger), `index` is either 0 or `m - 1` (again depending on which difference is larger). `ans` is 0, `tp1` is 0, `tp2` is `m - 1`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
Code of the loop:
while max_heap:
    item = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    if item[2] < tp1 or item[2] > tp2:
        diff1 = abs(item[1] - b[tp1])
        diff2 = abs(item[1] - b[tp2])
        if diff1 > diff2:
            tp1 += 1
            ans += diff1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1
            ans += diff2
    else:
        ans += -item[0]
        if item[2] == tp1:
            tp1 += 1
        else:
            tp2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value. If `item[2]` is less than `tp1` or greater than `tp2`, then if `diff1` > `diff2`, `ans` is `diff1`, `tp1` is 1, and `tp2` is `m - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `ans + diff2`, `tp1` is 0, and `tp2` is `m - 2`. If `item[2]` is between the updated `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive, `ans` is `-item[0]`, `tp1` is updated to 1 if `item[2]` is equal to 0, otherwise `tp1` remains 0, and `tp2` is updated to `m - 2` if `item[2]` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains `m - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`max_heap` is a list containing `n-2` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and either `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]`. If `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` or `tp2` is adjusted based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2`. If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `max_heap` is a list containing `n-3` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]` or the absolute value of the difference between `item[1]` and either `b[tp1]` or `b[tp2]` based on the condition. If `item[2]` is outside the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `tp1` or `tp2` is adjusted based on the comparison of `diff1` and `diff2` (if `diff1 > diff2`, `tp1` is incremented by 1; if `diff1 <= diff2`, `tp2` is decremented by 1). If `item[2]` is within the range `[tp1, tp2]`, `ans` is increased by the absolute value of `item[0]`, and `tp1` is incremented by 1 if `item[2]` equals `tp1`, otherwise `tp2` is decremented by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
