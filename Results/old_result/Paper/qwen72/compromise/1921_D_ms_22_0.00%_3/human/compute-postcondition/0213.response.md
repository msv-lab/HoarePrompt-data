Postcondition: **`max_heap` is a list containing `n-1` tuples, each of the form `(-diff, i, index)`, `ans` is `-item[0]`, `tp1` is updated to 1 if `item[2]` is equal to 0, otherwise `tp1` remains 0. `tp2` is updated to `m - 2` if `item[2]` is not equal to 0, otherwise it remains `m - 1`. `t` is `t - n - 1` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user and must have `n` elements, `b` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `max_heap` which had the smallest negative `diff` value, and `item[2]` is between the updated `tp1` and `tp2` inclusive.**
