Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. It efficiently calculates the maximum total difference \(D\) between Petya's array \(a_i\) and Vasya's array \(c_i\) by using a max heap to prioritize the largest differences. Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integers \(n\) and \(m\), followed by the arrays \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Sorting Array \(b\)**: The array \(b\) is sorted to facilitate the selection of the largest possible differences.

3. **Max Heap Construction**: A max heap is used to store tuples of the form \((-difference, a_i, index)\). The negative difference is used to simulate a max heap using Python's `heapq` which is a min heap by default. The differences are calculated between each element in \(a\) and the smallest and largest elements in \(b\).

4. **Heap Processing**: The program processes the heap to construct the array \(c\) by always selecting the element from \(b\) that maximizes the difference. It keeps track of the indices \(tp1\) and \(tp2\) to ensure that the elements from \(b\) are used exactly once.

5. **Output**: The total difference \(D\) is calculated and printed for each test case.

The logic and implementation are sound and should handle the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
