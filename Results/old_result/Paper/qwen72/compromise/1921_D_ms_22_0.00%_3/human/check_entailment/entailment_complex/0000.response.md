### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads the arrays `a` and `b` and processes them to find the maximum total difference `D`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**:
   - The array `b` is sorted, which is a necessary step to efficiently find the maximum difference.
   - A max heap is initialized to store the differences and the corresponding indices.

3. **Heap Population**:
   - For each element `i` in `a`, the program calculates the absolute differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b` (i.e., `b[0]` and `b[m-1]`).
   - It pushes the negative of the larger difference (to simulate a max heap using Python's min heap) along with the element `i` and the index of the element in `b` (either `0` or `m-1`) into the heap.

4. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the heap to ensure that the elements in `b` are used optimally to maximize the difference.
   - It checks if the index stored in the heap is within the current range `[tp1, tp2]`. If not, it recalculates the differences with the current smallest and largest elements in the range.
   - It then updates the answer `ans` with the maximum difference and adjusts the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` accordingly.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum total difference `D` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The sorting of `b` ensures that the smallest and largest elements are always available for comparison.
- The use of a max heap allows the program to always choose the element in `b` that maximizes the difference for the current element in `a`.
- The pointers `tp1` and `tp2` are used to keep track of the available elements in `b` and ensure that each element in `b` is used at most once.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` by always choosing the largest possible difference for each element in `a`.
- The use of the heap and the pointers ensures that the elements in `b` are used optimally.
- The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

**Correctness: **True**
