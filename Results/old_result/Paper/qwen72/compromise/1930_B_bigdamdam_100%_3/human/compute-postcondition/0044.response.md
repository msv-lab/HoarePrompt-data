The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates with `i` starting from 1, incrementing by 2, and continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 2 (as specified in the loop's step), so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `p[1]` is `ind + 2`**
