The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is automatically initialized by the `range` function, starting from 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
