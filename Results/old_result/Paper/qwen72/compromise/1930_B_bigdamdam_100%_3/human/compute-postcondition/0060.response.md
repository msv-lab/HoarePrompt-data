The code snippet `p[i] = ind` modifies the list `p` by setting the element at index `i` to the value of `ind`. Given that `i` is `n` and `ind` is `n - 2`, this means `p[n]` is set to `n - 2`. However, since `p` is a list of `n` elements, the valid indices for `p` are from `0` to `n - 1`. Therefore, setting `p[n]` would result in an `IndexError` because `n` is out of bounds for the list `p`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n`, `p` is a list of `n` zeros except `p[n - 2]` is `n`, `ind` is equal to `n - 2`, and an `IndexError` occurs.**
