Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `p` is a list where the first element is `n`, the second element is `n - 2`, and the rest are zeros, `ind` is equal to `n - 4`**

The value of `ind` is decremented by 2, so it is now equal to `n - 4`. The values of `i`, `n`, and the list `p` remain unchanged.
