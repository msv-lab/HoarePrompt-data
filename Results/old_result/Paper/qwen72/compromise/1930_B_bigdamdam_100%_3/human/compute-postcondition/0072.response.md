Output State: **`n` is an even number greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `p` is a list of `n` integers where `p[0]` is `n`, `p[1]` is 1, `p[2]` is `n - 2`, `p[3]` is 3, `p[4]` is `n - 4`, and so on, with the rest of the elements being zero, `ind` is 5.**

Explanation: The value of `ind` is incremented by 2, changing its value from 3 to 5. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
