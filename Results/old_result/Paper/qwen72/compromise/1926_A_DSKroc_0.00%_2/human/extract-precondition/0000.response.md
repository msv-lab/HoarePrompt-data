Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop or context where it processes multiple test cases. Each test case provides a string `s` of length 5 consisting of letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B}. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, and all `t` strings are distinct.**
