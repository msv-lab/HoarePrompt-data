Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop, but `0` is not included in `ans` anymore, `m` is 0, `temp` is an empty set, and `n` is added to `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is added to the set `ans`.
- The other variables (`m`, `x`, and `temp`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `0` is not included in `ans` still holds.
- The values of `n`, `m`, and `x` are still the values returned by `func_3()`.
- The set `ans` now includes the value `n` in addition to the values it previously contained.
