The code snippet `temp.add((q - r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. This element is the result of the expression `(q - r) % n`.

- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `m` is `m - 1`.
- `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` must be a non-empty set.
- `q` is the next value in `ans`.
- If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`.
- If `c` is not '0' or '?', `temp` remains an empty set.

Given the initial state, the code snippet adds the value `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. Since `temp` is initially a set containing `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?', or an empty set otherwise, after the code execution, `temp` will contain the value `(q - r) % n` in addition to any existing values.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a non-empty set, `q` is the next value in `ans`, and `temp` is a set containing the value `(q - r) % n` and possibly `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0' or '?'.**
