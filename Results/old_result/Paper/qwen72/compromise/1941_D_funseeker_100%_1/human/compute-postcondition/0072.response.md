Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()` in each iteration. `m` is 0, and `temp` is an empty set. The set `ans` contains the value 0.**
