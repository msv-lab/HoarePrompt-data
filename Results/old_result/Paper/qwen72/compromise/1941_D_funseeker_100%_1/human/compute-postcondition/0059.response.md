The loop head contains the variable `q` and the list `ans`. Therefore, only these can be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `n` is unchanged.
- `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`.
- `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` must contain at least one element.
- `temp` is an empty set unless `c` is '0' or '?', in which case `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The list `ans` must still contain at least one element.
- The variable `q` will be set to the next element in `ans`.

Since `q` is updated to the next element in `ans` and `ans` must still contain at least one element for the loop to continue, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must contain at least one element, `q` is the next element in `ans`, and `temp` is an empty set unless `c` is '0' or '?', in which case `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` also contains the element `(q - r) % n`.**
