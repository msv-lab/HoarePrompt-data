Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the value of `x`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m):
    r, c = func_1().split()
    r = int(r)
    temp = set()
    for q in ans:
        if c == '0' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q + r) % n)
        if c == '1' or c == '?':
            temp.add((q - r) % n)
    ans = temp


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is a set containing the values `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '?', or containing the values `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1', or remains the same as the original `ans` if `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?'. `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace. `temp` is now an empty set.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans)`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is now equal to `temp`, `temp` is a set containing all possible values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '?', or containing all possible values of `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '1', or remains an empty set if `c` is '0' or neither '0', '1', nor '?'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` is now equal to `temp`, and `temp` contains all the unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` if `c` is '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is not '0', '1', or '?', `temp` remains an empty set.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
