To determine what will be printed by the `print(*sorted(ans))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n`, `m`, and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
   - `ans` is a set containing all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in the original `ans` for each iteration of the loop.
   - `m` is 0.
   - `temp` is an empty set.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, `0` is removed from `ans` and `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding the Operations:**
   - The set `ans` is initially populated with values derived from some operations involving `q` and `r` modulo `n`.
   - The condition checks if `0` is in `ans`. If it is, `0` is removed and `n` is added to `ans`.

3. **Final State:**
   - The set `ans` will contain all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` after the loop.
   - If `0` was in `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(*sorted(ans))` statement will print the sorted elements of the set `ans`.

Since the exact values of `q` and `r` are not provided, and the function `func_3()` is not defined, we can't determine the exact numerical values in `ans`. However, we can describe the output based on the operations and conditions given:

- If `0` was in `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added.
- The final set `ans` will be sorted and printed.

Output: **sorted(ans) (where ans is the set of unique values of (q + r) % n and (q - r) % n, with 0 removed and n added if 0 was present)**
