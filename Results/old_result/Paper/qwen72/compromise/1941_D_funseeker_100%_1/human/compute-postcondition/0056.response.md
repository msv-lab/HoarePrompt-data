Postcondition: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must contain at least one element, and `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n` because `c` is either '0' or '?'. Additionally, `c` is either '1' or '?'.**
