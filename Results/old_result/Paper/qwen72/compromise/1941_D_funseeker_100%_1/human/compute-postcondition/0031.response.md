Output State: **`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must be a non-empty set, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`, and `c` is either '0' or '?'.**

Explanation:
- The value `(q + r) % n` is computed and added to the set `temp`.
- `r` remains the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace.
- `c` remains the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, and it is either '0' or '?'.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `m` is still `m - 1`.
- `x` remains the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `ans` remains a non-empty set.
- `temp` is no longer an empty set; it now contains the value `(q + r) % n`.
