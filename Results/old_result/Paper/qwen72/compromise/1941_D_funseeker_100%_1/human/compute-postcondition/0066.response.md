Postcondition: ***`r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1()` split by whitespace, `n` is unchanged, `m` is `m - len(ans) - 1`, `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, `ans` must contain at least two elements, `q` is the second element in `ans`, and `temp` is an empty set unless `c` is '0', '1', or '?'. If `c` is '0' or '?', `temp` contains the element `(q + r) % n`. If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` contains the elements `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`.***
