### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `map(int, func_1().split())` to parse integers from the input. This is a common and efficient way to handle input in Python, especially for competitive programming. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read and parse the input, which is correct.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This correctly handles the clockwise direction.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This correctly handles the counterclockwise direction.

4. **Handling Zero Position:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`, and a position of `0` should be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is the correct format for the output as specified in the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Reading:**
  - `func_1()` reads a line of input and strips any trailing whitespace.
  - `func_2()` converts the input to an integer.
  - `func_3()` splits the input line by spaces and converts each part to an integer.
  - `func_4()` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The set `ans` is used to keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.
  - For each throw, the program considers both possible directions if the direction is unknown (`?`).
  - The use of set operations ensures that duplicate positions are not added, and the set remains efficient.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation `q % n` is used to handle the circular nature of the game. This ensures that the position wraps around correctly when it exceeds `n` or goes below `1`.

- **Adjusting Zero Position:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the position is `0` by converting it to `n`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the number of possible players and then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Potential Issues:

- **Modulo Operation with Negative Values:**
  - The expression `(q - r) % n` can result in a negative value, which when taken modulo `n` can still be negative. For example, if `q = 1` and `r = 2`, `(1 - 2) % 10` results in `-1 % 10`, which is `-1`. This should be adjusted to ensure it is a positive value within the range `[1, n]`.
  - To fix this, the expression should be `(q - r) % n` followed by `if result == 0: result = n` or `result = (q - r + n) % n + 1` to handle the negative case correctly.

### Corrected Code:

```python
import sys
from functools import lru_cache

# Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

# Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

# Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r - 1) % n + 1)  # Adjust for 1-based indexing
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r + n - 1) % n + 1)  # Adjust for 1-based indexing and handle negative values
        ans = temp
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
t = func_2()
for _ in range(t):
    func_4()
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original assessment was mostly accurate, but it missed a critical detail regarding the handling of negative values in the modulo operation.
- The corrected code ensures that the positions are correctly adjusted to be within the range `[1, n]` for both clockwise and counterclockwise throws.

Final: **False** (The original program has a potential issue with negative values in the modulo operation, which can lead to incorrect results.)
