You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf and Bernard decided to play a game with their friends. n people stand
in a circle and start throwing a ball to each other. They are numbered from 1
to n in the clockwise order.

Let's call a transition a movement of the ball from one player to his
neighbor. The transition can be made clockwise or counterclockwise.

Let's call the clockwise (counterclockwise) distance from player y_1 to player
y_2 the number of transitions clockwise (counterclockwise) that need to be
made to move from player y_1 to player y_2 . For example, if n=7 then the
clockwise distance from 2 to 5 is 3 , and the counterclockwise distance from 2
to 5 is 4 .

Initially, the ball is with the player number x (players are numbered
clockwise). On the i -th move the person with the ball throws it at a distance
of r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) clockwise or counterclockwise. For example, if
there are 7 players, and the 2 nd player, after receiving the ball, throws it
a distance of 5 , then the ball will be caught by either the 7 th player
(throwing clockwise) or the 4 th player (throwing counterclockwise). An
illustration of this example is shown below.

The game was interrupted after m throws due to unexpected rain. When the rain
stopped, the guys gathered again to continue. However, no one could remember
who had the ball. As it turned out, Bernard remembered the distances for each
of the throws and the direction for some of the throws (clockwise or
counterclockwise).

Rudolf asks you to help him and based on the information from Bernard,
calculate the numbers of the players who could have the ball after m throws.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m, x (2 \le n \le
1000 , 1 \le m \le 1000 , 1 \le x \le n ) — the number of players, the number
of throws made, and the number of the player who threw the ball first,
respectively.

The next m lines contain information about each throw in order. Each of them
contains an integer r_i (1 \le r_i \le n - 1 ) — the distance at which the i
-th throw was made, and a symbol c_i , equal to '0', '1', or '?':

  * if c_i ='0', then the i -th throw was made clockwise, 
  * if c_i ='1', then the i -th throw was made counterclockwise, 
  * if c_i ='?', then Bernard does not remember the direction and the i -th throw could have been made either clockwise or counterclockwise. 

It is guaranteed that the sum n \cdot m (n multiplied by m ) over all test
cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

In the first line, output the number of players k (1 \le k \le n ) who could
have the ball at the end of the game.

In the next line, output k numbers b_i (1 \le b_i \le n ) — the numbers of the
players in increasing order. All numbers must be different.

- Program:
import sys
from functools import lru_cache
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return sys.stdin.readline().strip()

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return int(func_1())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, func_1().split()))

#Function 4:
def func_4():
    (n, m, x) = func_3()
    ans = {x}
    for _ in range(m):
        (r, c) = func_1().split()
        r = int(r)
        temp = set()
        for q in ans:
            if c == '0' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q + r) % n)
            if c == '1' or c == '?':
                temp.add((q - r) % n)
        ans = temp
    if 0 in ans:
        ans.discard(0)
        ans.add(n)
    print(len(ans))
    print(*sorted(ans))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It initializes `n`, `m`, and `x` by calling `func_3()`. It then performs a series of operations based on the values returned by `func_1()` in a loop that runs `m` times. The function maintains a set `ans` which initially contains the value `x`. For each iteration, it updates `ans` to include all unique values of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` for each `q` in `ans`, where `r` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1()`. After the loop, if `0` is in `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to `ans`. Finally, the function prints the length of `ans` and the sorted elements of `ans`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses `sys.stdin.readline().strip()` to read input lines and `map(int, func_1().split())` to parse integers from the input. This is a common and efficient way to handle input in Python, especially for competitive programming.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`. This is correct because the ball starts with player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws:**
   - For each throw, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
   - If the direction `c` is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`. This correctly handles the clockwise direction.
   - If the direction `c` is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`. This correctly handles the counterclockwise direction.

4. **Handling Zero Position:**
   - After processing all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set. This is necessary because the players are numbered from `1` to `n`, and a position of `0` should be adjusted to `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball and then prints the sorted list of these players. This is the correct format for the output as specified in the problem statement.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Reading:**
  - `func_1()` reads a line of input and strips any trailing whitespace.
  - `func_2()` converts the input to an integer.
  - `func_3()` splits the input line by spaces and converts each part to an integer.
  - `func_4()` reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`.

- **Set Operations:**
  - The set `ans` is used to keep track of all possible positions of the ball after each throw.
  - For each throw, the program considers both possible directions if the direction is unknown (`?`).
  - The use of set operations ensures that duplicate positions are not added, and the set remains efficient.

- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The modulo operation `q % n` is used to handle the circular nature of the game. This ensures that the position wraps around correctly when it exceeds `n` or goes below `1`.

- **Adjusting Zero Position:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the position is `0` by converting it to `n`.

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the number of possible players and then prints the sorted list of these players.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible positions of the ball after a series of throws, considering both known and unknown directions. It handles the circular nature of the game and the input/output format as specified in the problem statement.
