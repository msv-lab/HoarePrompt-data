Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_1` to read lines from standard input and strip any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases.
   - `func_3` reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is used to initialize `n`, `m`, and `x` for each test case.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - It then updates the set `ans` to include all possible positions the ball could be in after the throw, considering both clockwise and counterclockwise directions if `c` is `?`.
   - The use of a set ensures that all positions are unique.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - After all throws, the program checks if `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set, which is correct because in a circular arrangement, position `0` is equivalent to position `n`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of players who could have the ball.
   - It then prints the sorted list of these players.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that `n` and `m` are within the specified limits.
   - The use of `lru_cache` is not necessary in this program, but it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

6. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations to update the set `ans` are correct. The program correctly calculates the new positions using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the game.
   - The final step of replacing `0` with `n` is also correctly implemented.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
