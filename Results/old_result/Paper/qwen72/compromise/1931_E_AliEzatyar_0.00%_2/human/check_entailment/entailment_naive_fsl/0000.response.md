Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has several issues that prevent it from working correctly for every potential case:

1. **Typo in the Output**: The program outputs "Sashah" instead of "Sasha". This is a clear typo and will result in incorrect output.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Total Digits**: The program calculates the total number of digits by summing the lengths of the strings in the array. However, it does not account for the fact that reversing a number might change the number of digits (e.g., reversing 100 results in 1, which has fewer digits).

3. **Incorrect Handling of Zeros**: The function `func_1` counts the trailing zeros in a number, but the program incorrectly uses this count to determine the outcome of the game. The logic for subtracting the number of zeros is flawed and does not correctly simulate the game's rules.

4. **Optimal Play Not Considered**: The program does not consider the optimal play for both players. It simply calculates the total number of digits and subtracts some zeros, which does not reflect the game's strategy.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Program Output:**
```
Sashah
```

The typo in the output "Sashah" is the primary issue here, but the logic for determining the winner is also flawed. The program should correctly simulate the game's rules and consider the optimal play for both players.
