To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for i in range(k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` in the range `range(k - 1)`.
   - Therefore, the variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the range `range(k - 1)` must contain at least one element.
   - This means `k - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1, i.e., `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - `i` should start at 0 (the first value in the range).
   - `k` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is 0 (the initial value of `i` when the loop starts).
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is the maximum subarray sum of non-negative contiguous subarrays of `a`, `tmp` is the sum of the current subarray being considered, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `ans` is now equal to `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**.
