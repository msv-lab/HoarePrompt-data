Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers where `k` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is now `(4 * t) % MOD`, `tmp` is the current running sum that does not drop below zero, `ans` is `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD + (4 * t) % MOD` modulo `MOD`, `i` is 1.** 

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to `2 * t`, which means `t` is now `(4 * t) % MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged, but the expression for `ans` is updated to reflect the new value of `t`.
