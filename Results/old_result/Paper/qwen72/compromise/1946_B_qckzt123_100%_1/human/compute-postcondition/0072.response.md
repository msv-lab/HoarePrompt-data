Output State: **`t` is now `(t % MOD) * 2`, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is now equal to `((s + (t % MOD) * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `t` is updated to be twice its current value, which is `(t % MOD) * 2`.
- All other variables (`tmp`, `s`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
