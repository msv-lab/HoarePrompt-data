The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` relative to `k-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k-1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must still be less than `k-1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is now `t % MOD`, `tmp` is the last cumulative sum of the subarray being considered, which may be zero if it dropped below zero, `s` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` must be greater than 1, `ans` is now equal to `((s + (t % MOD) * 2) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`, `i` is 1**
