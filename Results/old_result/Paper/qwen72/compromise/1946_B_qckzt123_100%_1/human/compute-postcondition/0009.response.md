Postcondition: **`T` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 1 element, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is 0, `tmp` is now `x`, `x` is the first element in the list `a`, and the current value of `tmp` is less than 0.**
