To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement:

### Given Information:
- `T` is an integer read from the standard input, with the constraint 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers with the constraint -10^9 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of the values of `n` and `k` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
- `MOD` is 1000000007.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for _ in range(T):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and `T`.
- The loop will execute if `T` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range of `T`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- To ensure the loop executes, `T` must be greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is not relevant to the initial state since it is just a placeholder for the loop counter.

### Final State:
Since the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop execution is `T`, we need to ensure that `T` is greater than 0. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `MOD`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`T` must be greater than 0**
