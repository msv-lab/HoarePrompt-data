Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `s` is the sum of the elements in `a`, `t` is the maximum of `tmp` and the maximum of `x` and 0, `x` is the second element in the list `a`. If `tmp + x` is less than 0, then `tmp` is set to 0. Otherwise, `tmp` remains as `tmp + x`.**
