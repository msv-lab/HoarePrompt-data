Postcondition: ***`t` is the maximum of the original `t` and `tmp`, `s` is the sum of the elements in the list `a`, `n` and `k` are updated to the new input values, `i` is `k-2`, `a` is a list of integers read from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in the list `a`, and `tmp` is updated to `tmp + x`. If `tmp` is less than 0, `t` remains 0, and `ans` is `((s + 0 * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. Otherwise, `t` is the maximum of the original `t` and `tmp`, and `ans` is `((s + t * (2^(k-1))) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`.***
