Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is `(t * 2) % MOD`, `ans` is `(ans + t) % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` remains 1.
- The value of `k` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- The value of `t` is updated to `(t * 2) % MOD`.
- The value of `ans` is updated to `(ans + t) % MOD`. This means that the new value of `ans` is the sum of the previous value of `ans` and the current value of `t`, modulo `MOD`.
