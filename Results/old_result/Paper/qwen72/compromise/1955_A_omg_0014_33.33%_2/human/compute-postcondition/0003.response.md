The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems that the function is designed to work with multiple test cases, each involving parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function likely processes these parameters internally or through external means (e.g., user input, predefined data).

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. Since the specific output conditions are not provided, we can only infer that the function processes these parameters and returns some form of output for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30), and returns a result for each test case.**
