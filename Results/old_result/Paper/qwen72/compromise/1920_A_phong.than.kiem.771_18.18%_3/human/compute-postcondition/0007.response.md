Output State: **The program returns a list of integers converted from the items in `items`. If `space` is true, `items` contains strings split from `line` by spaces. If `space` is false, `items` contains individual characters from `line`. Since `to_int` is true, each item in `items` is converted to an integer before being returned.**
