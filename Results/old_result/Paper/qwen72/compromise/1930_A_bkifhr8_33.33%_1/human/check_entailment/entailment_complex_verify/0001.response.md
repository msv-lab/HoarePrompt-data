### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers.

2. **List Splitting and Conversion**: The program reads the list of integers as a single string and splits it into a list of strings. However, it does not convert these strings to integers until it starts processing the list, which is a bit inefficient but not incorrect.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program aims to calculate the maximum score by repeatedly selecting the minimum of two integers and adding it to the score. However, the way it selects and removes elements from the list is flawed.

4. **Element Removal**: The program uses `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` and `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` to remove elements. This is incorrect because:
   - `0 * 2` and `1 * 2` are always 0 and 2, respectively, regardless of the iteration.
   - This means the program will always remove the first and third elements, which is not the intended behavior. The correct approach should be to remove the first two elements in each iteration.

5. **Correct Approach**: To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to sort the list of integers and then pair the smallest elements together. This ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible.

6. **Sorting and Pairing**: The program should sort the list and then iterate over the sorted list, adding the minimum of each pair to the score. Since the list is sorted, the minimum of each pair will always be the first element in the pair.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State Before Function Call**: `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 50\), and `a` is a list of 2n integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- **State After Reading Input**: `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of pairs for the current test case, and `lst` is a list of 2n integers as strings.
- **State During Loop**: The program iterates over the list, but the element removal logic is incorrect. It should remove the first two elements in each iteration.
- **State After Loop**: `ans` is the calculated score for the current test case, and `ans_f` is a list of scores for all test cases.
- **State After All Test Cases**: `ans_f` is a list of `t` integers, each representing the score for a test case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    ans_f = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = input()
        lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
        lst.sort()
        ans = sum(lst[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        ans_f.append(ans)
    for ans in ans_f:
        print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting**: The list `lst` is sorted in ascending order.
- **Pairing**: The program iterates over the sorted list, taking every second element (which is the minimum of each pair in the sorted list) and adds it to the score.
- **Output**: The final score for each test case is appended to `ans_f` and printed at the end.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the reasoning above, the original program is incorrect due to the flawed element removal logic. The corrected program, however, is correct and will produce the desired output.

Final: **False**
