The function reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 5000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads another integer `n` (where `1 <= n <= 50`) and a list of `2n` integers (each between `1` and `10^7`). The function then processes each list by repeatedly removing the two smallest elements and adding the smaller of the two to a running sum until the list has 2 or fewer elements remaining. The final sum for each test case is appended to a list `ans_f`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function prints each element of `ans_f`. The final state of the program is that `ans_f` is a list of `t` integers, and the input has been fully consumed.
