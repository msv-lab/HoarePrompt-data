The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`. 

Given the initial state:
- `i` is 1
- `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50
- `ans` is increased by the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`
- `lst` has its first element removed

The impact of the code is:
- The element at index 2 of `lst` is removed.
- The values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is increased by the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `lst` has its first and third elements removed.**
