Output State: **`i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `l` is the new input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the new input string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list of substrings to `lst`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `t`, `ans`, and `ans_f` remain unchanged.
- The new value of `lst` is a list of substrings obtained from the new input string `l` by splitting it at spaces.
- The new input string `l` is still `l` after the code execution.
