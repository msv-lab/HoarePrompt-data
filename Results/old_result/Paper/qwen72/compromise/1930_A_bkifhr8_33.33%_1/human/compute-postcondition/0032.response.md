The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` being less than `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n * 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it `n * 2`.

The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` must be less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`.

State: **`i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of pairs of integers from `lst` until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, `lst` has 2 or fewer elements remaining, `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`**
