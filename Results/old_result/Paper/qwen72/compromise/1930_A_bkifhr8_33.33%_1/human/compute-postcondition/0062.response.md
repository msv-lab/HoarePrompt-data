The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, and `t` must be greater than `n * 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be `n * 2 + 1`. The condition for `t` to allow the loop to execute again is that `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`.

State: **`i` is `n * 2 + 1`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is the sum of the minimum values of the first two integers in `lst` for each iteration until `lst` has 2 or fewer elements, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, with elements removed in pairs until 2 or fewer elements remain, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `l` is an input string.**
