Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (converted to integers) added to the initial `ans` value (which was 0), `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string `l` by spaces, but the first element of `lst` has been removed, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, and the length of `lst` is not 2.**
