The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` removes the first element of the list `lst` because `0 * 2` evaluates to 0, and `lst[0]` refers to the first element of the list.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (after converting them to integers), and the first element of `lst` has been removed.**
