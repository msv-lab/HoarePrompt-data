The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`. The initial state indicates that the first element of `lst` has already been removed, so the list has at least two elements remaining. The value of `i` and `n` are not affected by this code, and `ans` is still increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (after converting them to integers).

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is increased by the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` (after converting them to integers), the first element of `lst` has been removed, and the third element of `lst` has been removed.**
