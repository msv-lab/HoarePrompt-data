Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n * 2`, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is 0, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the previous `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, `l` is an input string.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n * 2):
    if len(lst) != 2:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
        lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
    else:
        ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the minimum of the first two integers in `lst`, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements (index 2) of `lst` are removed, and `ans` is the minimum of the remaining first two integers. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the integers obtained from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the previous `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, and `l` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two integers in `lst` and the previous `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements (index 2) of `lst` are removed, and `ans` is the minimum of the remaining first two integers. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the integers obtained from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the previous `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, and `l` is an input string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 2, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `ans` is the sum of the minimum of the first two integers in `lst` and the previous `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first and third elements (index 2) of `lst` are removed, and `ans` is the minimum of the remaining first two integers. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is the minimum of the integers obtained from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `ans_f` is a list that now includes the value of the updated `ans`, `t` must be greater than `n * 2`, and `l` is an input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
