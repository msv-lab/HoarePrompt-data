Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer where 1 <= n <= 50, `t` must be greater than `n * 2 + 1`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `lst` is a list of substrings obtained by splitting the new input string `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list that includes the final value of `ans`, `l` is the new input string, and the length of `lst` is exactly 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
