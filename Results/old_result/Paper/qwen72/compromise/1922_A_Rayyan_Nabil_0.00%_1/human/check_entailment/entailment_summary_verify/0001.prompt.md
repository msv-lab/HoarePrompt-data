You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        print(l)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n`. It checks if for each character position `i` in the strings, at least one of the characters in `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches the character in `c[i]`. If this condition is met for all positions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that the value of `l` will be 'NO' if any test case failed the condition, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the same as their final values after the last iteration of the loop.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - It checks if the characters at position `i` in strings `a` and `b` are different from the character at position `i` in string `c`.
   - If for any position `i`, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, it sets the variable `l` to 'YES'.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such position, it sets `l` to 'NO'.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `l` after processing each test case.

4. **Logical Flaw**:
   - The program has a logical flaw in the way it handles the template matching. Specifically, it sets `l` to 'YES' if it finds any position where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`, but it does not reset `l` to 'NO' if it finds a position where either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]` and the previous positions were valid.
   - This means that if the first position is valid, but a later position is invalid, the program will still print 'YES', which is incorrect.

5. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct approach should be to set `l` to 'YES' initially and then iterate through each position. If at any position `i`, either `a[i]` or `b[i]` matches `c[i]`, set `l` to 'NO' and break out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `l` to 'NO', then print 'YES'. Otherwise, print 'NO'.

Given this reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case where a valid position is followed by an invalid position.
