Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the strings `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not. Instead, it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]` for each position `i`. This check is insufficient because it does not verify that `a` and `b` match the template as required.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3
abc
def
ghi
```
The program will output "YES" for this input, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, there should be no template that allows both `a` and `b` to match while `c` does not. For each position `i`:
- `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, so they can match a template where `t[i]` is any uppercase letter.
- However, `c[i]` is also different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, so it can also match the same template.

Thus, there is no template that satisfies the condition where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. The program should output "NO" for this case, but it incorrectly outputs "YES".
