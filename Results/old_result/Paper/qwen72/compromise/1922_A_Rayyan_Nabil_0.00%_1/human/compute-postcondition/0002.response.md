The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, and `t` should be an integer value provided by the user that is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `l` is 'YES'**
