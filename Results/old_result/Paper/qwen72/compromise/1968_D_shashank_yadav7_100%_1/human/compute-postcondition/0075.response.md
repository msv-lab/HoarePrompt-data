Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 1)` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + sp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
