Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * (input integer - 2) + 2 * a[b]`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sp` is updated by adding `a[s]` to its current value.
- Initially, `sp` was `a[s] + a[s]`.
- After the code execution, `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `bm`, `sm`, `bp`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `k` and the loop or if statement breaking remain the same.
