The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`, `bp` is `a[b] + a[b]` (or `2 * a[b]`).**
