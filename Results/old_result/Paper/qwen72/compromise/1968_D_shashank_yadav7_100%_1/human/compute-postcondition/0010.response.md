Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n`, `k`, and `b` are input integers, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is an input integer minus 1, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is `a[b] * k`, `sm` is `a[s] * k`.** 

The value of `sm` is now `a[s] * k`, where `s` is an input integer minus 1, and `a[s]` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
