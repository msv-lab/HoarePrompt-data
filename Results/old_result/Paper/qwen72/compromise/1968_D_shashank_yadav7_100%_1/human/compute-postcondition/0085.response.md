Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 2)`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, and `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 2)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`, and `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
