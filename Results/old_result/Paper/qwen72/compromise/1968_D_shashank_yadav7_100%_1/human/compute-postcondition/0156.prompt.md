You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined method, not as parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases. For each test case, the first line contains four integers n, k, P_B, P_S where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The second line contains n integers p_1, ..., p_n representing the permutation, where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n. The third line contains n integers a_1, ..., a_n representing the array, where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b -= 1
        
        s -= 1
        
        sp = a[s]
        
        bp = a[b]
        
        bm = a[b] * k
        
        sm = a[s] * k
        
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0 or the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations that were executed, `b` is the final value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (where the number of nested `p[b] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `s` is the final value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (where the number of nested `p[s] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in `a` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in `a` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` holds. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the condition `bm < sm` holds. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the condition `bm == sm` holds.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each consisting of four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, followed by a permutation of `n` integers and an array of `n` integers. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
