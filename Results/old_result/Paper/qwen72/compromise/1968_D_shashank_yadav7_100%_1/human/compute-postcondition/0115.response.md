Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, and `k` is currently 0, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `sp` is `a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `sm` is `a[s] * (k + 1)`, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
