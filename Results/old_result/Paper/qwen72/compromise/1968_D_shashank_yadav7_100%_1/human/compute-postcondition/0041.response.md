Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is `k - 1`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp` plus the integer at index `s` in the list `a`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp` plus the integer at index `b` in the list `a`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * (k - 3), a[b] * (k - 2) + bp, a[b] * (k - 1) + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k - 3) + sp, a[s] * (k - 2) + sp, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation:
- The value of `bp` is incremented by the integer at index `b` in the list `a`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
