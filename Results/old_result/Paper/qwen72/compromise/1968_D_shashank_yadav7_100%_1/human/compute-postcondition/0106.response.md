Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is the value of `n` when `k` first becomes 0 or `n` if the loop completes without `k` becoming 0 + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer, `s` is the input integer, `sp` is the sum of `a[s]` and `a[p[s] - 1]` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of `a[b]` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * (k + i) + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * (k + i) + sp` for each iteration, and `bm` is greater than `sm` if the if condition is true. If the if condition is false, `bm` is less than or equal to `sm`. `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
