Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is `n` if `k` is greater than 0 or `i` is the next value after `k` becomes 0, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `b` is the input integer - 1, `s` is the input integer - 1, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is now equal to `a[s]`, `bp` is now equal to `a[b]`, `bm` is now equal to `a[b] * k`, `sm` is now equal to `a[s] * k`. If `k` is 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks. After the if-else block, if `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` holds. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the condition `bm < sm` holds. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the condition `bm == sm` holds.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    k -= 1
    if k == 0:
        break
    b = p[b] - 1
    s = p[s] - 1
    bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
    sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
    sp += a[s]
    bp += a[b]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 1)` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + sp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is the input integer - 2, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `2 * a[b] + a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 1)`, `a[b] * k + bp`, and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)`, `a[s] * k + sp`, and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `k` is the input integer - 3, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1] + a[s] + a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `3 * a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 2)`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, `a[b] * (k + 1) + bp`, and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 2)`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`, `a[s] * (k + 1) + sp`, and `a[s] * k + sp`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
