Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is `a[s] + a[s]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of the previous `bm` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of the previous `sm` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `sp += a[s]` increments the value of `sp` by `a[s]`. Since `sp` was initially `a[s]`, after the increment, `sp` becomes `a[s] + a[s]`. The other variables remain unchanged, so their initial states are still valid.
