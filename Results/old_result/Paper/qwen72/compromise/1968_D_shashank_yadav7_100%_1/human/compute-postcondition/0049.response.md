Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is `n - 1` if `k` is greater than 0, or `i` is the last value before `k` becomes 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations that were executed.
- `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[b] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed).
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[s] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed).
- `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in `a` for each iteration.
- `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in `a` for each iteration.
- `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
- `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
- If `k` is 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks.
- Additionally, `bm` is greater than or equal to `sm`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Draw')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet is a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'Draw'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and their relationships, but none of this information affects the `print` statement directly.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the string `'Draw'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will always print the string `'Draw'` regardless of the values of the variables and objects described in the initial state.

Output: **Draw**
