To determine what will be printed by the `print('Bodya')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n - 1` if `k` is greater than 0, or `i` is the last value before `k` becomes 0.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `k` is the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations that were executed.
   - `b` is the value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[b] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed).
   - `p` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `s` is the value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1` (where the number of nested `p[s] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed).
   - `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in `a` for each iteration.
   - `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in `a` for each iteration.
   - `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration.
   - `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration.
   - `bm` is greater than `sm`.
   - If `k` is 0 at any point, `bm` and `sm` are both 0, and the loop breaks.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print('Bodya')` is a simple print statement that prints the string 'Bodya'.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The initial state and the conditions provided do not affect the print statement directly. The print statement is independent of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.
   - The string 'Bodya' is a constant and will be printed as is.

Therefore, the output of the `print('Bodya')` statement is:

Output: **Bodya**
