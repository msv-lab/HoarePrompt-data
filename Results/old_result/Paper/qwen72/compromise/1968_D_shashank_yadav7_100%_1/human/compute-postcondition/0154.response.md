Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is `t - 1`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0 or the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations that were executed, `b` is the final value of `p[p[...p[b] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (where the number of nested `p[b] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `s` is the final value of `p[p[...p[s] - 1... - 1] - 1]` (where the number of nested `p[s] - 1` operations is equal to the number of iterations executed), `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in `a` for each iteration, `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in `a` for each iteration, `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` for each iteration, `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` for each iteration. If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` holds. If `bm` is less than `sm`, the condition `bm < sm` holds. If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the condition `bm == sm` holds.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: The number of test cases is greater than 0, indicating that the loop has run at least once.
- **`i`**: The loop index `i` is `t - 1`, meaning the loop has completed all `t` iterations.
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer for each test case.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` is either 0 (if it was decremented to 0 during the loop) or the initial value of `k` minus the number of iterations that were executed.
- **`b`**: The value of `b` is the final result after applying the permutation `p` and decrementing by 1 for each iteration. This means `b` has been updated to the last valid index in the permutation sequence before `k` became 0 or the loop completed.
- **`s`**: The value of `s` is the final result after applying the permutation `p` and decrementing by 1 for each iteration. This means `s` has been updated to the last valid index in the permutation sequence before `k` became 0 or the loop completed.
- **`sp`**: The value of `sp` is the sum of the initial value of `sp` and the values at the indices `s` in the array `a` for each iteration.
- **`bp`**: The value of `bp` is the sum of the initial value of `bp` and the values at the indices `b` in the array `a` for each iteration.
- **`bm`**: The value of `bm` is the maximum value of `a[b] * k + bp` calculated during each iteration.
- **`sm`**: The value of `sm` is the maximum value of `a[s] * k + sp` calculated during each iteration.
- **Comparison**:
  - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, the condition `bm > sm` holds, and "Bodya" is printed.
  - If `bm` is less than `sm`, the condition `bm < sm` holds, and "Sasha" is printed.
  - If `bm` is equal to `sm`, the condition `bm == sm` holds, and "Draw" is printed.
