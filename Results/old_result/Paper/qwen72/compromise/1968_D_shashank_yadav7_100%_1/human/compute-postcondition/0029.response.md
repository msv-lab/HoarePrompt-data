Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2`, `b` is `p[p[b] - 1] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `sp` is the integer at index `s` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `sp`, `bp` is the integer at index `b` in the list `a` plus the previous value of `bp`, `bm` is `max(bm, a[b] * (k - 2), a[b] * (k - 1) + bp, a[b] * k + bp)`, `sm` is `max(sm, a[s] * (k - 2) + sp, a[s] * (k - 1) + sp, a[s] * k + sp)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `a[s] * k + sp`.
- The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `p`, `a`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, and `bm` remain unchanged, but the value of `sm` is now the maximum of its previous value and the new calculated value `a[s] * k + sp`.
