Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is the input integer - 1, `b` is `p[b] - 1`, `s` is `p[s] - 1`, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `sp` is `a[p[s] - 1]`, `bp` is `a[b]`, `bm` is the maximum of `a[b] * (k + 1)` and `a[b] * k + bp`, `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + sp`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[s] * k + sp`.
- The current value of `sm` is `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)`.
- The new value of `sm` is the maximum of `a[p[s] - 1] * (k + 1)` and `a[s] * k + sp`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
