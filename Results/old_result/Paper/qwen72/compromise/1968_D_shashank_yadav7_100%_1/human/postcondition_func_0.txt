The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, followed by a permutation of `n` integers and an array of `n` integers. It processes these inputs to determine the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, or if the game ends in a draw. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that for each test case, it prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' to the standard output. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are modified during the execution, but their final values are not returned or used outside the function.
