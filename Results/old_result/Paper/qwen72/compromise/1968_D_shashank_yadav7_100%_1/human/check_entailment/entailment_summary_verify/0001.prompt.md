You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        sp = a[s]
        bp = a[b]
        bm = a[b] * k
        sm = a[s] * k
        for i in range(n):
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of four integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, followed by a permutation of `n` integers and an array of `n` integers. It processes these inputs to determine the winner of a game between two players, Bodya and Sasha, or if the game ends in a draw. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that for each test case, it prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' to the standard output. The variables `t`, `i`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `sp`, `bp`, `bm`, and `sm` are modified during the execution, but their final values are not returned or used outside the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted to 0-based indexing by subtracting 1 from each.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The scores for Bodya and Sasha are initialized to the values at their starting positions in the array `a`.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - In each turn, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It also updates the scores for both players by adding the value at their current position in the array `a`.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha by considering the remaining turns and the current scores.
   - The `max` function is used to ensure that the scores are updated correctly based on the remaining turns.

5. **Output:**
   - After simulating the game, the program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints "Bodya" if Bodya's score is higher, "Sasha" if Sasha's score is higher, and "Draw" if the scores are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
  - The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores using the formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp`. This formula is not correct because it assumes that the player will stay at the same position for the remaining turns, which is not necessarily true.
  - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for exactly `k` turns and keep track of the scores without trying to calculate the maximum possible scores.

- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop terminates after `k` turns, but the loop variable `k` is decremented inside the loop, which is not necessary. The loop should simply run `k` times.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that simulates the game correctly:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        bodya_score = a[b]
        sasha_score = a[s]
        
        for _ in range(k - 1):
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bodya_score += a[b]
            sasha_score += a[s]
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the original program is used without correction.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned in the reasoning.)
