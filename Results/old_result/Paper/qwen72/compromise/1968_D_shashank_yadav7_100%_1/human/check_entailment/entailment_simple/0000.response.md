### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and the arrays `p` and `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert from 1-based to 0-based indexing, which is appropriate for Python lists.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively, which is a reasonable starting point since the maximum score a player can achieve is by staying in the same position for all `k` turns.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - The function simulates the game for `k` turns using a loop.
   - In each turn, the current positions `b` and `s` are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively, which correctly simulates the move to the next position in the permutation.
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are updated by adding the value at the current position in the array `a`.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are updated to ensure that the players are always trying to maximize their scores.

5. **Output:**
   - After simulating the game, the function compares the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` and prints the result accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Loop Iteration:**
  - The loop iterates `n` times, but it should iterate `k` times. The loop condition should be `for i in range(k)` instead of `for i in range(n)`.
  - The decrement of `k` inside the loop is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect behavior if `k` is not exactly `n`.

- **Score Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `bm` and `sm` inside the loop is incorrect. The current implementation updates `bm` and `sm` with the maximum possible score for the remaining turns, but it does not correctly account for the cumulative score over all turns.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not properly simulate the game for `k` turns and the score calculation is flawed.

### Correctness: **False**
