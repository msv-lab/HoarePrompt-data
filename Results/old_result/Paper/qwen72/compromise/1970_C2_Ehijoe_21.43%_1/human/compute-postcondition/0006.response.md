Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged. `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory, where each key from 1 to n (inclusive) has a list of integers representing the nodes it is connected to. `start` remains unchanged. `edges` is an empty list. `empty` is False. `leaves` is an empty deque.**

The code initializes `leaves` as an empty deque. All other variables (`n`, `t`, `nodes`, `start`, `edges`, and `empty`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
