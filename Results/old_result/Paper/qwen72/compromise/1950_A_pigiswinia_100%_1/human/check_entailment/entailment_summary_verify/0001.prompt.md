You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After executing `t` test cases, the function completes, and the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be those read in the last test case, while the value of `t` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input.

2. **Conditions for Stair and Peak:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair.
   - It then checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should correctly output "NONE".
   - The program also handles cases where the digits are not in a strict increasing or decreasing order, which should correctly output "NONE".

5. **Constraints:**
   - The constraints are `1 <= t <= 1000` and `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`, which are respected by the program's input handling.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
