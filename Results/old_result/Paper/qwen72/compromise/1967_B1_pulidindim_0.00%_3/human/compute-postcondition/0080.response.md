Postcondition: ***`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `m` must be greater than or equal to 4, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is now equal to `n / 4`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
