Output State: **`t` is a specific positive integer provided by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, `m` must be greater than or equal to 2, `count` is 2, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 1, `g` is equal to `n / 2 - 1`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.**

Explanation:
- `ans` is updated by adding `g / count + 1` to its current value.
- `g` is `n / 2 - 1`.
- `count` is 2.
- Therefore, `ans` becomes `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`.
- The other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `countmins`, and `g`) remain unchanged.
