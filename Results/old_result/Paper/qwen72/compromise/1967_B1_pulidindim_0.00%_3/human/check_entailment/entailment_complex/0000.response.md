Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the implementation has some issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Initialization of `count`**: The variable `count` is initialized to 2, which is incorrect. The problem requires \(1 \le b \le m\), so `count` should start from 1.
2. **Calculation of `g`**: The variable `g` is calculated as \(g = \frac{n}{\text{count}}\). This is not the correct way to compute the number of valid pairs. The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition `while count <= m:` is correct in terms of the range of \(b\), but the logic inside the loop is flawed.
4. **Adjustments to `ans`**: The adjustments made to `ans` inside the loop are not based on a correct mathematical or logical derivation. The formula `ans += g / count + 1` does not correctly count the valid pairs.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
- Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of valid pairs and print the result for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        ans = 0
        
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
