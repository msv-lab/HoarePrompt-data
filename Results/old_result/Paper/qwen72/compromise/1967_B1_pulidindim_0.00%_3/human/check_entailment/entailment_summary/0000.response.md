Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Let's break down the provided program and see if it meets these requirements.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `count` is initialized to 2.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to \(n\).

3. **Loop for Each \(b\)**:
   - The loop iterates over each possible value of \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
   - For each \(b\), it calculates the number of valid \(a\) values:
     - `countmins` is set to \(b - 1\).
     - `g` is calculated as \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{b} \right\rfloor\).
     - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, it updates `ans` by adding \(\left\lfloor \frac{g - (b - 1)}{b} \right\rfloor + 1\).

4. **Output**:
   - The result `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Base Case**:
  - For \(b = 1\), the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) simplifies to \(a + 1\) being a multiple of 1, which is always true. Therefore, there are \(n\) valid pairs \((a, 1)\).

- **General Case**:
  - For \(b > 1\), the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
    \[
    a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
    \]
    This implies:
    \[
    a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
    \]
    Since \(\gcd(a, b)\) divides \(a\), \(a\) must be a multiple of \(\gcd(a, b)\). Let \(a = d \cdot a'\) and \(b = d \cdot b'\) where \(d = \gcd(a, b)\). Then:
    \[
    d \cdot a' + d \cdot b' = k \cdot d \cdot b' \cdot d \implies a' + b' = k \cdot d \cdot b'
    \]
    This simplifies to:
    \[
    a' = (k \cdot d - 1) \cdot b'
    \]
    For \(a\) to be valid, \(a' \le \frac{n}{d}\). The number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(b\) is the number of multiples of \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(n\).

- **Loop Logic**:
  - The loop iterates over each \(b\) from 2 to \(m\).
  - `countmins` is \(b - 1\), which is used to ensure that \(a\) is at least \(b - 1\).
  - `g` is the number of multiples of \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(n\).
  - The condition `if g < countmins` ensures that there are enough multiples of \(b\) to form valid pairs.
  - The update `ans += g / count + 1` adds the number of valid pairs for the current \(b\).

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Calculation**:
  - The calculation `ans += g / count + 1` is incorrect. It should be `ans += (g - (b - 1)) // b + 1` to correctly count the number of valid pairs.
  - The division `g / count` should be integer division `g // count`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = n  # Initialize with the number of pairs (a, 1)
        for count in range(2, m + 1):
            countmins = count - 1
            g = n // count
            if g < countmins:
                break
            ans += (g - countmins) // count + 1
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the number of valid pairs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
