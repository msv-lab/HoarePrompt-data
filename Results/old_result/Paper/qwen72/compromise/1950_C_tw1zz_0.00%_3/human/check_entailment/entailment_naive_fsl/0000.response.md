Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is "12" correctly for PM times. According to the problem description, "12:00" in 24-hour format should be "12:00 PM" in 12-hour format, but the program incorrectly sets the time to "12:00 AM" for "12:00". This is a clear violation of the problem description. 

To illustrate:
- Input: "12:00"
- Expected Output: "12:00 PM"
- Actual Output: "12:00 AM"
