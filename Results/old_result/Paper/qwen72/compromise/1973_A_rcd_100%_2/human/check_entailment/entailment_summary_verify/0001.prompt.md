You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and, for each test case, three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30. For each test case, it performs the following actions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the score of the third player (`p3`) is greater than or equal to the sum of the scores of the first two players (`p1 + p2`), it prints `p1 + p2`. Otherwise, it iterates through a loop to find a point where `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y` and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If no such point is found, it prints `p3`. The function does not return any values, but it prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Total Score Check**:
   - The program checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is correct because the total score must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (for a win/loss) or 2 points (for a draw), so the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Score Consistency Check**:
   - The program then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`.
   - This check is correct because if the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, the maximum number of draws is `p1 + p2`. This is because the highest score can be achieved by winning all non-draw games, and the other two players can only get points from draws.

4. **Finding Maximum Draws**:
   - If the above condition is not met, the program initializes `x` to 0 and `y` to `p3`.
   - It then enters a while loop where it checks if `p1 - x` is less than or equal to `p2 - y`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 - x + p3` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The loop increments `x` and decrements `y` until `y` is no longer greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a valid solution, it prints `p3`.

5. **Validation of the Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic is designed to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the scores of `p1` and `p3` while ensuring that the scores remain consistent.
   - The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the remaining score of `p1` after `x` draws is less than or equal to the remaining score of `p2` after `y` draws. This is necessary to ensure that the scores can be achieved with the given number of draws.
   - If the loop finds a valid solution, it prints the maximum number of draws. If not, it prints `p3`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the total score check and the score consistency check.
- The loop logic is designed to find the maximum number of draws, and it appears to be correctly implemented to ensure that the scores remain consistent.
- The program prints the correct output for the given test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
