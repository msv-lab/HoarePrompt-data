Output State: **After all iterations, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input, with `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30, and the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. `t` is the total number of test cases, and `_` is `t - 1`. If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` at any point, the loop breaks and prints `p1 - x + p3`. If this condition is never met, the loop continues until `y < x`, and then prints `p3`. The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is the number of iterations the loop has run, and `y` is `p3 - x`. The other variables (`p1`, `p2`, `p3`, `t`) remain unchanged.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variables `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will still be the integers provided by the user input, and they will still satisfy the condition `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30. The variable `t` will still represent the total number of test cases. The loop counter `_` will be equal to `t - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. For each test case, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, the loop will print `-1` and move to the next iteration. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the loop will print `p1 + p2` and move to the next iteration. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the loop will adjust `x` and `y` until either `p1 - x` ≤ `p2 - y` is true, in which case it will print `p1 - x + p3`, or `y < x` is true, in which case it will print `p3`. The values of `x` and `y` will be such that `x` is the number of iterations the loop has run, and `y` is `p3 - x`. The original values of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` for each test case will not be altered by the loop.
