Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
   - `t` must be greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `_` is 0 (though `_` is not used in the code snippet).
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(p1 + p2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - Since `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` and `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, we know that `p3` is at least as large as `p1 + p2`.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This means that the sum of `p1` and `p2` must be even (since adding an odd number to an even number results in an odd number).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The value of `p1 + p2` is an even number.
   - The exact value of `p1 + p2` depends on the specific values of `p1` and `p2` provided by the user, but it will always be an even number.

Output: **p1 + p2 (where p1 + p2 is an even number and p1 and p2 are integers such that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30 and p3 ≥ p1 + p2)**
