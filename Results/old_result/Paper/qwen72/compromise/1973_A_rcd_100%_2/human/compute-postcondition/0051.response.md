Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are integers provided by user input.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `p1` ≤ `p2` ≤ `p3` ≤ 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd.
   - `x` is 1.
   - `y` is `p3 - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(p1 - x + p3)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `x` is explicitly given as 1.
   - `p1` and `p3` are integers such that `p1` ≤ `p3` and both are between 1 and 30.
   - The sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd. This means that the sum of `p1` and `p3` (since `p2` is between them) must also contribute to making the total sum odd.

4. **Expression Calculation:**
   - The expression inside the print statement is `p1 - x + p3`.
   - Substituting the value of `x` (which is 1), the expression becomes `p1 - 1 + p3`.
   - Simplifying the expression, we get `p1 + p3 - 1`.

5. **Output Description:**
   - The output will be the result of the expression `p1 + p3 - 1`.
   - Since `p1` and `p3` are integers between 1 and 30, and `p1` ≤ `p3`, the value of `p1 + p3 - 1` will be an integer between 1 and 59 (inclusive).

Given the initial state and the expression, the output will be the value of `p1 + p3 - 1`.

Output: **p1 + p3 - 1 (where p1 and p3 are integers such that 1 ≤ p1 ≤ p3 ≤ 30 and the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd)**
