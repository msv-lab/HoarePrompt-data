Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `n` is 0.
2. `k` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a constant).
3. `costs` remains the same (its value is not specified, but it is a list).
4. `h` is the sum of the initial values of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
5. `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Calculate `n // (n - k + 1)`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n - k + 1` is `0 - k + 1` which simplifies to `1 - k`.
   - `n // (n - k + 1)` is `0 // (1 - k)`.
   - Since `1 - k` is not zero (as `k` is a constant and `n` is 0), the result of `0 // (1 - k)` is 0 (integer division of 0 by any non-zero integer is 0).

2. **Calculate `n // 1`**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `n // 1` is `0 // 1` which is 0 (integer division of 0 by 1 is 0).

3. **Calculate `h`**:
   - `h` is the sum of `0 // (1 - k)` and `0 // 1`.
   - Both `0 // (1 - k)` and `0 // 1` are 0.
   - Therefore, `h` is `0 + 0` which is 0.

4. **Check the condition `h >= k`**:
   - `h` is 0.
   - `k` is a constant, but its value is not specified.
   - The condition `h >= k` implies that `0 >= k`, which means `k` must be 0 or a negative integer for this condition to hold true.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(*costs)
```

### Explanation:
- The `print(*costs)` statement unpacks the list `costs` and prints its elements separated by spaces.
- Since the initial state does not provide the explicit values of `costs`, we can only describe the output based on the fact that `costs` is a list of some values.

### Final Output:
Output: **[elements of the list `costs` separated by spaces]** (where `costs` is a list of some values, and the exact values are not specified in the initial state).
