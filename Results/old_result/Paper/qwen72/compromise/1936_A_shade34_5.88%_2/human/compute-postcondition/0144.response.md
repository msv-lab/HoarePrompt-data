Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, which means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `pans`.
   - `_` is 1 (though this variable is not used in the print statement).
   - `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<'.
   - `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was ever input.
   - `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<'.
   - The output buffer has been flushed (this is not relevant to the print statement).

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('!', mak2, mak)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mak2` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<'.
   - `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was ever input.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The print statement will output a string that starts with '!', followed by the value of `mak2`, and then the value of `mak`.
   - `mak2` is the largest index `i` where the input `s` was '<'.
   - `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` where the input `s` was '>', or 0 if no such element exists.

Given the initial state, the output will be:
Output: **! [mak2] [mak] (where mak2 is the largest index i for which the input s was '<', and mak is the index of the last element in pans for which the input was '>', or 0 if no '>' was ever input)**
