Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and `pans` must have at least 4 elements, `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', the output buffer has been flushed.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, all the initial state information remains valid.
