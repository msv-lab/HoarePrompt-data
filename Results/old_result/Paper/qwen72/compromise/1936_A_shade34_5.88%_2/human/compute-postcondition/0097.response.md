Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 1, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.** 

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. No other variables are affected by this code, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
