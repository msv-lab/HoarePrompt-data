The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `pans`. The loop will execute if `i` is within the range from 1 to `len(pans) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, and `pans` must have at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `pans` must have at least 4 elements to ensure that `i` is still within the valid range.

However, the loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration. Since `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to `n + 1` at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to continue, `n + 1` must be less than `len(pans)`, meaning `len(pans)` must be at least `n + 2`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 4 elements, `mak` is `n` if the input was '>', otherwise `mak` is 0 or `n-1` depending on whether the input was '>' or not, `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**
