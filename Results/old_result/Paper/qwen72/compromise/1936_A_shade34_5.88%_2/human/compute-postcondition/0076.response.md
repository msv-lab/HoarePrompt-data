The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1` (not including `n`). The variable `i` is initialized to `n-1` before the loop starts, but this value is not used in the loop head; instead, `i` is reinitialized by the `range` function to start from 1. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, _ is 1, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
