Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '>', `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
