Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `mak` is 0 or 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the input string is '<', `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
