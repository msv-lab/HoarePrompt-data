Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mak` is the largest index `i` for which the input was '>', `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: The loop iterates over `range(1, len(pans))`, so after the loop finishes, `i` will be `len(pans) - 1`. Since `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `i` will be `n-1` (as `pans` is derived from `n` and contains at least 2 elements).
- **`_`**: Remains 2 as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`pans`**: The list `pans` remains unchanged as it is only used for indexing and not modified within the loop.
- **`mak`**: After the loop finishes, `mak` will be the largest index `i` for which the input was '>'. If no input was '>', `mak` will remain 0.
- **`mak2`**: Remains the largest index `i` for which the input was '<' as it is not modified within the loop.
- **Output Buffer**: The output buffer is flushed after each iteration, so it remains flushed after the loop finishes.
