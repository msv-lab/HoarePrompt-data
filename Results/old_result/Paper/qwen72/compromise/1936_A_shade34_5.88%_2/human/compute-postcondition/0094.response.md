Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**

The code snippet `pans = []` reassigns the variable `pans` to an empty list, overriding its previous value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
