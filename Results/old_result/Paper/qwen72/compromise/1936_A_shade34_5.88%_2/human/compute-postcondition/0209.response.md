Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 3 elements, `mak` is `n`, `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<', and the output buffer has been flushed.**

The value of `mak` is updated to be equal to `n`, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
