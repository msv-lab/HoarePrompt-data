Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list with at least `n` elements, and the output buffer has been flushed. `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution, and `mak2` is 0.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `n` remains the input integer, `i` is `n-1` (the last value it was set to in the loop), `_` is still 1, `pans` is still a list with at least `n` elements, and the output buffer has been flushed. The variable `mak` will hold the largest value of `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution, and `mak2` remains 0 as it is not modified within the loop.
