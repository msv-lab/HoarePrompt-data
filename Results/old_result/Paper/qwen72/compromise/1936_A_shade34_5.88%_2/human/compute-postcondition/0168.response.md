The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial state of `i` is `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head, which initializes `i` to 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
