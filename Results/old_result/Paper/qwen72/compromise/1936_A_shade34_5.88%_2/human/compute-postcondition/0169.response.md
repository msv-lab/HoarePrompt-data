To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the variables involved:

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.

The `print` statement is:
```python
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

From the initial state, we know:
- `i` is explicitly defined as 0.
- `n` is greater than 0, but its exact value is not provided.

However, the variables `mak` and `mak2` are not defined in the initial state. Since their values are not provided, we cannot determine their exact values. Therefore, we will describe them as undefined.

Given this information, the `print` statement will output:
- The string `?`
- The value of `mak` (which is undefined)
- The value of `mak2` (which is undefined)
- The value of `i` which is 0
- The value of `mak2` (which is undefined)

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 0 [mak2] (where mak and mak2 are undefined variables)**
