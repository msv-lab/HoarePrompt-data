The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.**
