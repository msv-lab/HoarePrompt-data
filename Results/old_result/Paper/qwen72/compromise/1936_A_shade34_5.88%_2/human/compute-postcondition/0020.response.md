Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n-1`, `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.** 

The value of `mak2` is now the same as `mak`, which is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided. The other variables remain unchanged.
