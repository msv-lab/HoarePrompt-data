The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. `n` must still be greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s` is the input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 0, and `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0]`. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` remains unchanged.**
