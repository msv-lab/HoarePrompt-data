Output State: **`n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is '<' or '=', otherwise `pans` remains an empty list. The output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0 if `s` is '<', otherwise `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the user input was '<' during the loop execution. `mak2` is equal to `mak`, and `s` is the input string.**

The code snippet `sys.stdout.flush()` only affects the output buffer, which is already mentioned as being flushed in the initial state. Therefore, the values of all other variables remain unchanged.
