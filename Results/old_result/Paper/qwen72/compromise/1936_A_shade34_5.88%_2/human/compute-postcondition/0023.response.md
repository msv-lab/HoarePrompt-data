Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is greater than 3.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `mak` is the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.
   - `pans` is an empty list.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Variable Values:**
   - `mak` is described as the largest integer `i` for which the input was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such input was provided. Since the initial state does not specify any loop execution or input, we assume `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so `mak2` is also 0.
   - `i` is explicitly given as 0.
   - The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The print statement will print the string `'?'`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2`.
   - Since `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` are all 0, the output will be:
     ```
     ?, 0, 0, 0, 0
     ```

Output: **?, 0, 0, 0, 0**
