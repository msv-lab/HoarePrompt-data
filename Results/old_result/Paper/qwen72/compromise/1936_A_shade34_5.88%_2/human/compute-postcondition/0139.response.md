Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `_` is 1 (though it's not used in the print statement).
- `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<'. It is guaranteed to have at least 4 elements.
- `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the input. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.
- `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<'.
- The output buffer has been flushed (this is not relevant to the print statement).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `i`:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the value of `mak`:**
   - `mak` is 0 if the input is not '>'.
   - `mak` is `n` if the input is '>'.
   - Since the exact input is not provided, we need to consider both cases:
     - If the input is '>', `mak` is `n`.
     - If the input is not '>', `mak` is 0.

3. **Determine the value of `pans[mak]`:**
   - `pans` is a list with at least 4 elements.
   - If `mak` is 0, `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
   - If `mak` is `n`, `pans[mak]` is `pans[n]`.

4. **Determine the value of `pans[i]`:**
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - Since `pans` has at least 4 elements, `pans[i]` is `pans[n + 1]`.

### Output Calculation:
- The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `pans[mak]`, `pans[mak]`, `pans[i]`, and `pans[i]`.

### Case 1: Input is '>'
- `mak` is `n`.
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[n]`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[n + 1]`.

Output: **? [pans[n]] [pans[n]] [pans[n + 1]] [pans[n + 1]] (where pans[n] is the element at index n of the list pans and pans[n + 1] is the element at index n + 1 of the list pans)**

### Case 2: Input is not '>'
- `mak` is 0.
- `pans[mak]` is `pans[0]`.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `pans[i]` is `pans[n + 1]`.

Output: **? [pans[0]] [pans[0]] [pans[n + 1]] [pans[n + 1]] (where pans[0] is the first element of the list pans and pans[n + 1] is the element at index n + 1 of the list pans)**

### Final Output:
Since the exact input is not provided, we need to cover both cases. However, the format of the output is the same in both cases, just with different values for `pans[mak]`.

Output: **? [pans[mak]] [pans[mak]] [pans[n + 1]] [pans[n + 1]] (where pans[mak] is the element at index mak of the list pans, and pans[n + 1] is the element at index n + 1 of the list pans, with mak being 0 if the input is not '>' and n if the input is '>')**
