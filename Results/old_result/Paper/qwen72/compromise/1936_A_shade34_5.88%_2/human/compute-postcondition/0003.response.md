The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range starts at 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`. Before the loop starts, `_` is 0 and `mak` is 0, but these variables are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted. The variable `i` will be set to 1 by the loop itself on the first iteration.

State: **`_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1, `mak` is 0, `i` is 1**
