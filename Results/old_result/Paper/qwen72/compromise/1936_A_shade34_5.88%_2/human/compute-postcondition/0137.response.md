Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n`, `_` is 1, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the input `s` was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input `s` was '<', and `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `mak` is 0 or `n` depending on the input, `mak2` is equal to the largest integer `i` for which the input `s` was '<', the output buffer has been flushed. If the input is '>', `mak` is set to `n`. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.***
