Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `_` is 2, `pans` is a list containing the indices `i` for which the input was '=' or the last index `i` for which the input was '<' and must have at least 4 elements. If the input is '>', `mak` is `n + 1` and `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'. Otherwise, `mak` is 0 or `n - 1` depending on whether the input was '>' or not, and `mak2` is equal to the largest index `i` for which the input was '<'. The output buffer has been flushed.***
