Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `s` is '<', `mak` is 2 and `pans` is a list containing `[2]`. If `s` is '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1, 2]`. If `s` is neither '<' nor '=', `pans` is a list containing `[0, 1, 2]`.***
