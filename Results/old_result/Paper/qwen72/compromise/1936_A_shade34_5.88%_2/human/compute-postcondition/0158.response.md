Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `mak` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that is equal to `<`, then `mak` is set to 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `mak`. The other conditions in the initial state remain unchanged, so `n` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. The condition about user input setting `mak` to 1 is also still valid, but `mak` is now 2 due to the assignment.
