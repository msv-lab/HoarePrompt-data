Precondition: **n is an integer representing the size of the n x n chessboard, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should take additional parameters to account for the number of moves `k` and the positions of the moves `r_i` and `c_i`. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of moves `(r_i, c_i)`.

Given the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case is a tuple containing n (the size of the n x n chessboard, 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), k (the number of moves already played, 0 ≤ k ≤ n), and a list of k tuples (r_i, c_i) representing the positions of the moves, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n.**
