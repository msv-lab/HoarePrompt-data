Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to determine the remaining available positions on the board.

2. **Processing Moves**:
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a != b`, it reduces the available positions by 2 (one for the white rook and one for the black rook).
   - If `a == b`, it reduces the available positions by 1 (since the computer skips its turn).

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` uses a dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with base cases `[1, 1]` (1 configuration for 0 and 1 rook).
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the DP array based on the formula:
     \[
     \text{dp}[i] = (\text{dp}[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot \text{dp}[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - This formula accounts for placing a rook in a new row and column, and the different ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, ensuring that the number of configurations is computed efficiently and accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
