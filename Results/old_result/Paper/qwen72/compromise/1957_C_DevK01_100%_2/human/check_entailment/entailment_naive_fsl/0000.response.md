Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the chessboard size `n` is 1. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the only possible configuration is the initial one, as no more moves can be made. However, the program decreases `n` by 1 or 2 based on the initial moves, which can lead to incorrect results. For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 0`, the program will call `func_1(1)`, but the function `func_1` is designed to handle cases where `n` is at least 2, leading to an incorrect result.
