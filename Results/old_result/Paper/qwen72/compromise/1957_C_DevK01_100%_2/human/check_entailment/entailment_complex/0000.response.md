### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and processes them to update the size of the remaining board `n`.

2. **Move Processing:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`. If they are not equal, it reduces `n` by 2 (since both the player and the computer place rooks on the board, and these rooks occupy one row and one column each).
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, it reduces `n` by 1 (since the player places a rook on the board, and the computer skips its turn, leaving only one row and one column occupied).

3. **Dynamic Programming Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations of the board.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` with the first two values `[1, 1]`, which represent the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list using the formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (10^9 + 7)`. This formula is derived from the combinatorial problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard.
   - The list `dp` is maintained to have only the last two values, which are sufficient for the next iteration.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing the moves and updating `n`, the program calls `func_1(n)` to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - The result is printed modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the input and updates the size of the remaining board based on the moves.
- The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is appropriate for the problem and correctly computes the number of possible final configurations.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
