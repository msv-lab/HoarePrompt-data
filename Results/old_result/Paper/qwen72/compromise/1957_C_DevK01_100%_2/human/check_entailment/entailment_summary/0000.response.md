### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already made.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Move Validation and Board Update**:
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a != b`, it reduces `n` by 2, indicating that both the player's move and the computer's mirrored move occupy unique rows and columns.
   - If `a == b`, it reduces `n` by 1, indicating that the player's move and the computer's mirrored move are the same, thus only one row and one column are occupied.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` with the first two values `[1, 1]`.
   - It then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list using the formula:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \cdot (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2]) \mod (10^9 + 7)
     \]
   - The list `dp` is maintained with only the last two elements to save space.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the result of `func_1(n)`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and updates the board size `n` based on the moves made.
- The dynamic programming approach in `func_1` is designed to compute the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining board such that no two rooks attack each other. This approach is based on the recurrence relation for the number of derangements (permutations where no element appears in its original position), which is appropriate for this problem.
- The modulo operation ensures that the result does not overflow and is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for the given problem. It handles the input, updates the board size, and uses a dynamic programming approach to compute the number of possible final configurations. The execution summary confirms that the function `func_1` behaves as expected.
