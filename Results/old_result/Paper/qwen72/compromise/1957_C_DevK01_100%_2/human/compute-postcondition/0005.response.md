The value of `dp` is updated by appending a new element to the list. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`. Given the initial state, `dp` is `[1, 3]` and `i` is `3`.

- `dp[-1]` is `3`
- `dp[-2]` is `1`
- `i - 1` is `2`
- `2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` is `2 * 2 * 1` which is `4`
- `dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]` is `3 + 4` which is `7`
- `(7 + 10 ** 9)` is `1000000007`
- `7 % 1000000007` is `7`

Therefore, the new element appended to `dp` is `7`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `i` is 3, `dp` is `[1, 3, 7]`**
