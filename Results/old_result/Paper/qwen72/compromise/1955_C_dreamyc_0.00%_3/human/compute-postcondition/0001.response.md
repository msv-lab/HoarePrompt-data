Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= k <= 10^15. `nums` is a deque containing the same elements as the original list `nums`, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9. `ans` is 0.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `ans`, which is now set to 0.
