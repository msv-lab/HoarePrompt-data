Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least 2 elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `sz` is the second element of the list `a`. If `sz` is 1, then `mexsize` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `mexsize` remains 1.***
