The code snippet `mexsize = mexsize + 1` increments the value of `mexsize` by 1. Initially, `mexsize` is 1, so after the increment, `mexsize` becomes 2. The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, `sz`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least two elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `mexsize` is 2, `sz` is the second element of `a`. If `sz` (the second element of `a`) is equal to 1, then `mexsize` was previously updated to 2.**
