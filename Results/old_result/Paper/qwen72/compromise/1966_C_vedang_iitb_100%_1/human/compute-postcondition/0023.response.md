The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `tc` and `t`. If `tc` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tc` is 0 and `t` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `tc` is incremented by 1, so `tc` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `tc` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `mexsize` is the smallest integer greater than 0 that is not present in the list `a`. If `mexsize` is greater than `maxsize`, then `mexsize` is greater than the maximum value in the list `a`. Otherwise, `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.**
