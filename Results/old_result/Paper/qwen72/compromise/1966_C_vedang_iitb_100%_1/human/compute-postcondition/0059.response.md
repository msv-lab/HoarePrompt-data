The value of `mexsize` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `mexsize` could be 1 or 2 depending on whether `sz` (the third element of `a`) is equal to 1 or not. If `sz` is 1, `mexsize` was initially 2 and now becomes 3. If `sz` is not 1, `mexsize` was initially 1 and now becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `tc` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input that must have at least three elements, `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`, `sz` is the third element of `a`, `mexsize` is 2 if `sz` is not 1, otherwise `mexsize` is 3.**
