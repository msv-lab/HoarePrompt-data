To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `tc` is 1.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`).
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

4. **Determine the Value of `mexsize`:**
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, the smallest positive integer not present in `a` can be determined by checking the sequence of numbers in `a`.

5. **Possible Values of `mexsize`:**
   - If `a` contains all integers from 1 to some number, then `mexsize` would be the next integer after the last element in `a`.
   - If `a` is missing some integers, `mexsize` would be the smallest missing positive integer.

6. **Parity of `mexsize`:**
   - The parity (odd or even) of `mexsize` depends on the specific values in the list `a`.
   - However, since `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a`, it can be either odd or even.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Without the exact values of the list `a`, we cannot definitively determine whether `mexsize` is odd or even.
   - However, the print statement will output either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the parity of `mexsize`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be:

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
