To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 2.
   - `tc` is 2.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the input.
   - `maxsize` is the maximum value in the sorted list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - `mexsize` is less than or equal to `maxsize`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print('Alice' if mexsize % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement checks if `mexsize` is odd (`mexsize % 2 == 1`).
   - If `mexsize` is odd, it prints 'Alice'.
   - If `mexsize` is even, it prints 'Bob'.

4. **Determine the Value of `mexsize`:**
   - `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, `mexsize` will be the smallest positive integer that is missing from this list.
   - The value of `mexsize` can be either odd or even, depending on the specific values in the list `a`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Without the exact values of the list `a`, we cannot determine the exact value of `mexsize`.
   - However, we know that `mexsize` is a positive integer and it can be either odd or even.
   - The `print` statement will output 'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, and 'Bob' if `mexsize` is even.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print` statement depends on whether `mexsize` is odd or even. Therefore, the precise output is:

Output: **'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, otherwise 'Bob' (where `mexsize` is the smallest positive integer not present in the list `a`)**
