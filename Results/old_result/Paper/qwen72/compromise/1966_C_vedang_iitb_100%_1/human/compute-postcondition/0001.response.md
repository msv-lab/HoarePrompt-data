To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `tc` and `t`.

- `t` is the number of test cases, and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- `tc` is the loop variable that will iterate from 0 to `t-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer input by the user, representing the number of test cases.

For the loop to execute:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `tc` should start at 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
