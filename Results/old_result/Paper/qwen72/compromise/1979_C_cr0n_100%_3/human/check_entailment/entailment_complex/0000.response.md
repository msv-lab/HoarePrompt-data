Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_2` for each one. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `a * b // gcd(a, b)`. This is mathematically correct and is used to find the LCM of all elements in `vals`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads the number of outcomes `N` and the list of multipliers `vals` correctly.
   - **Calculating LCM**: It initializes `den` with the first element of `vals` and then iterates through the list, updating `den` to the LCM of `den` and the current element. This ensures that `den` is the LCM of all elements in `vals`.
   - **Calculating Bets**: It calculates the list `vprod` where each element is `den // vals[i]`. This is intended to be the bet for each outcome.
   - **Checking Feasibility**: It updates `den` to `den - sum(vprod)`. The condition `if den <= 0` checks if the total bet is greater than or equal to the LCM, which would mean that the total amount of coins bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. If this condition is met, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - **Outputting Bets**: If the condition is not met, it prints the elements of `vprod` separated by spaces, which are the bets for each outcome.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The LCM of the multipliers `vals` ensures that the bets are distributed in a way that the total amount of coins bet is a multiple of the LCM.
   - The list `vprod` is calculated as `den // vals[i]`, which means the bet for each outcome is the LCM divided by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the amount received back for the winning outcome is `vals[i] * (den // vals[i]) = den`, which is the LCM.
   - The check `if den <= 0` ensures that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the LCM, which is necessary to meet the problem's requirement that the total bet must be strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all multipliers are the same, the LCM will be that value, and the total bet will be `N * (den // vals[0])`. This will be equal to `N * (den // vals[0]) = N * (den // den) = N`, which is not strictly less than `den` if `N > 1`. Therefore, the program correctly handles this case by printing `-1`.
   - If the multipliers are different, the LCM will be a larger value, and the total bet will be the sum of the individual bets, which should be less than the LCM. This is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
