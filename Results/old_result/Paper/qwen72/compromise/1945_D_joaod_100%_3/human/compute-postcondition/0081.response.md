Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, and `total` is updated. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[-1]`. Otherwise, `total` is increased by the value of `custo_pra_passar_b[-1]`.***
