Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1 and must be at least 0, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is updated to either the cost to change at position -1 in `custo_pra_trocar_a` or `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `best` is the maximum float value (`sys.float_info.max`), and `v` is greater than `pos_final`. If `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is less than `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, `total` is set to the cost to change at position -1 in `custo_pra_trocar_a`. Otherwise, `total` is set to `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]` and `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` is greater than or equal to `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.***
