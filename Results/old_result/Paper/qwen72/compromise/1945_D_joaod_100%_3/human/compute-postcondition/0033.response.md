Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 0, `na_frente` is at least 0, `pos_final` is an input integer minus 1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `best` is the maximum float value, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `total` is incremented by the value at the index `v` in the list `custo_pra_passar_b`.
- Since `v` is `na_frente - 1`, the value of `total` is increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[na_frente - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
