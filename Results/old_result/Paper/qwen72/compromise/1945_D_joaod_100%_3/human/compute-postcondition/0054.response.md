Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer input by the user minus 1, `pos_final` is the second integer input by the user minus 2, `v` is -1, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers input by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers input by the user, `total` is 0, and `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` for each `v` from `na_frente` down to 0 where `v` ≤ `pos_final`.**
