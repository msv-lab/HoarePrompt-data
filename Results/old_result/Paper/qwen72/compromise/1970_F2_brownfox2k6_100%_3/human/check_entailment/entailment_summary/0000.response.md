### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of the Field:**
   - The program correctly initializes the field by reading the dimensions `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads the initial state of the field and populates the lists and dictionaries for goals, players, the Quaffle, and the Bludger. This is done correctly based on the input format.

2. **Game Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of steps `T` and processes each step.
   - For each step, it reads the entity performing the action and the action itself.
   - If the action is 'C' (catch), it updates the `carry` variable to indicate which player is carrying the Quaffle.
   - If the action is 'T' (throw), it updates the `carry` variable to `None` and checks if the Quaffle is in a goal. If so, it updates the score and prints the appropriate goal message, then resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field.
   - If the action is a movement ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'):
     - If the entity is the Quaffle or the Bludger, it calls `func_1` to update their position.
     - If the entity is a player, it calls `func_1` to update the player's position and then calls `func_2` to check for player eliminations.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly updates the position of the entity (Quaffle, Bludger, or player) based on the direction given.
   - It modifies the coordinates in place, which is appropriate for the problem.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function correctly identifies and eliminates players who are in the same position as the Bludger.
   - It prints the elimination message for each player and updates their position to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.
   - The players are printed in alphabetical order, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

5. **Final Score:**
   - After processing all the steps, the program prints the final score in the required format.

### Issues to Consider:
- **Bludger Elimination:**
  - The program correctly handles the elimination of players by the Bludger.
  - However, it should ensure that the Quaffle is not moved to a cell containing a goal if a player is eliminated while carrying it. The problem statement guarantees that this will not happen, so the program is safe in this regard.

- **Scoring Logic:**
  - The scoring logic is correctly implemented. The program checks if the Quaffle is in a goal and updates the score accordingly.
  - It also handles the case where a player scores in the wrong goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.

- **Quaffle Reset:**
  - The Quaffle is correctly reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the rules and requirements of the problem. It handles player movements, ball movements, scoring, and player eliminations as described. There are no apparent logical errors or issues that would cause the program to fail to meet the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
