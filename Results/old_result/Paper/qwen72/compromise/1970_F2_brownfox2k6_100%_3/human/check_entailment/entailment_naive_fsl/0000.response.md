Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not fully implement the logic required by the problem description. Specifically, it only contains two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which handle the movement of an object and the elimination of players by the Bludger, respectively. However, the program is missing several critical components:

1. **Scoring Logic**: The program does not handle the scoring logic, which involves checking if a player has placed the Quaffle in the opponent's goal and updating the score accordingly.
2. **Quaffle Movement**: The program does not handle the movement of the Quaffle when it is thrown or when it is reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
3. **Catching the Quaffle**: The program does not handle the logic for a player catching the Quaffle.
4. **Game Initialization and State Management**: The program does not initialize the game state or manage the state of the game (e.g., positions of players, balls, and goals) throughout the steps.
5. **Final Score Output**: The program does not output the final score at the end of the game.

Given these missing components, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
