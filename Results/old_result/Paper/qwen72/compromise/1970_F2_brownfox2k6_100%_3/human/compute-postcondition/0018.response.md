Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a non-negative integer.
   - `out` is a list containing all the keys from `player` whose values were equal to `blud` before the loop started.
   - The values of these keys in `player` are now `[-1, -1]`.
   - The values of other keys in `player` that were not equal to `blud` remain unchanged.
   - `out` must have at least two elements.
   - `p` is the second element in the sorted `out`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(t, p, 'ELIMINATED')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `t` is a non-negative integer, so it could be any integer \( t \geq 0 \).
   - `out` is a list of keys from `player` whose values were equal to `blud` before the loop started. Since `out` must have at least two elements, we know it contains at least two keys.
   - `p` is the second element in the sorted `out`. This means `p` is the second smallest key in the list `out`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output the value of `t`, followed by the value of `p`, and the string 'ELIMINATED'.
   - Since `t` is a non-negative integer, it will be printed as is.
   - `p` is the second smallest key in the sorted `out` list, so it will be printed as the second smallest key from the list of keys whose values were `blud`.

Output: **t, p, ELIMINATED (where t is a non-negative integer and p is the second smallest key in the sorted list of keys whose values were equal to `blud`)**
