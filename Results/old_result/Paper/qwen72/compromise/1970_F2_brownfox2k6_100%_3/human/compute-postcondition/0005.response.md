Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer, `out` is a list, `player` is an iterable with at least one element, and `p` is the first element of `player`. If the element at the index `p` in `player` is `blud`, `out` contains the first element of `player`, and the element at the index `p` in `player` is now `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, `out` remains an empty list.***
