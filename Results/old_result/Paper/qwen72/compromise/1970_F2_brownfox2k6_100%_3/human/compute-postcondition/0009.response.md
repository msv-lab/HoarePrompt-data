Postcondition: ***`t` is a non-negative integer, `out` is a list, `player` is an iterable with at least two elements, and `p` is the second element of `player`. If the second element of `player` is equal to `blud`, `out` contains the second element of `player`, and the second element of `player` is updated to `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
