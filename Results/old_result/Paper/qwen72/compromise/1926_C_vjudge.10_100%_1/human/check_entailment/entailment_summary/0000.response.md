Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of calculating the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for multiple test cases. The approach taken is to precompute the cumulative sum of the digits for all numbers up to the maximum possible value (200,000) and store these sums in a list `values`. This allows for quick lookups for each test case, which is crucial given the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

1. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes a list `values` of size `inf` (200,001) with zeros.
   - It iterates through each integer from 1 to 200,000, calculates the sum of its digits, and adds this sum to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i-1]`.
   - This ensures that `values[i]` contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and prints `values[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(200,000) time, which is feasible.
   - Each test case is handled in O(1) time due to the precomputation, making it efficient enough to meet the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The precomputation correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output for multiple test cases.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
