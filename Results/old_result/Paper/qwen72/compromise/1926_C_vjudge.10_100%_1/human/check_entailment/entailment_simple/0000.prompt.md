Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of integers n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case, where n is the largest number written on the board.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `n` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 200000.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200001, `values` remains a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `n` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 200000. The loop prints the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to the value provided by the user for each iteration of the loop.
