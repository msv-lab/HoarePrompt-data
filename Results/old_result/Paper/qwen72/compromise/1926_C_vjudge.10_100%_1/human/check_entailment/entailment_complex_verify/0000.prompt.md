You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of integers n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5) for each test case, where n is the largest number written on the board.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200001, `values` is a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `n` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 200000.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `inf` remains 200001, `values` remains a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `n` remains a list of integers where each integer is between 1 and 200000. The loop prints the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to the value provided by the user for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `t` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer from the user input, calculates the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to that number, and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` remaining unchanged, and `values` being a list where each element at index `i` (for `i` from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and stores these sums in a list. For each test case, it retrieves the precomputed sum for the given number and prints it. This approach ensures that the program runs efficiently within the given time limit, as the precomputation is done once and each test case is handled in constant time. The logic for summing the digits of each number and updating the cumulative sum is also correct. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential inputs.
