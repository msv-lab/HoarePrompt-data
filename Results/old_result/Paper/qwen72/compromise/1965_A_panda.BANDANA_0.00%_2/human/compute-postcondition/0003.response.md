Functionality: **The function `func` does not accept any parameters but reads input from standard input. It processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function then outputs the result for each test case to standard output.**
