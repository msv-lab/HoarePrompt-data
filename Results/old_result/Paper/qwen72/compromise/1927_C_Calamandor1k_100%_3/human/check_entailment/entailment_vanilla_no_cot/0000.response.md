Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes each test case by identifying the unique elements in arrays `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`. It then checks if the number of unique elements that are only in `a`, only in `b`, and in both arrays together can form a set that includes all integers from 1 to `k` when exactly `k/2` elements are chosen from each array. The logic in the function `func_1` ensures that the conditions specified in the problem are met, and it correctly appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on these conditions. The program also handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
