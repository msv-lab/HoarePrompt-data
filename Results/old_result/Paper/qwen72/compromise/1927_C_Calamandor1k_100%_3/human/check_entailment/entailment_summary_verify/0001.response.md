### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` (`n` and `m`), and the even number `k`.
   - It then reads the elements of arrays `a` and `b` and stores them in a list of tuples `cases`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to store the unique elements of arrays `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - The program calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both arrays (`both`).

4. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - **Condition 1:** If the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` that are not in `b`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 2:** Similarly, if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `b` that are not in `a`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 3:** If the total number of distinct elements in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` (i.e., `total_distinct`) is less than `k`, it means there are not enough unique elements to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`, so the program appends 'NO' to the results.
   - **Condition 4:** If none of the above conditions are met, it means it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array such that all numbers from 1 to `k` are included, so the program appends 'YES' to the results.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1 and Condition 2:** These conditions are necessary to ensure that there are enough unique elements in each array to form the required subset of size `k // 2`. If either condition is violated, it is impossible to form the required subset, and the program correctly appends 'NO'.
- **Condition 3:** This condition ensures that the total number of distinct elements from both arrays is at least `k`, which is necessary to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`. If this condition is violated, it means there are not enough unique elements to cover the range, and the program correctly appends 'NO'.
- **Condition 4:** If none of the above conditions are violated, the program correctly concludes that it is possible to choose the required elements and appends 'YES'.

### Edge Cases:
- **Test Case with All Elements in Range:** If all elements in both arrays are within the range [1, k], the program should correctly determine if it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
- **Test Case with Fewer Unique Elements:** If the total number of unique elements in both arrays is less than `k`, the program should correctly output 'NO'.
- **Test Case with More Unique Elements:** If there are more unique elements in both arrays than `k`, but the conditions are met, the program should correctly output 'YES'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem constraints and logic, ensuring that it can determine whether it is possible to choose the required elements for each test case. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
