You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, m, and k. For each tuple, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), and k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)). Each test case is followed by two lists of integers, a and b, with lengths n and m, respectively, and each element in a and b is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6).
def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        
        unique_b = set(b)
        
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        results.append('YES')
        
    #State: The `results` list is populated with 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases` based on the conditions checked in the loop. The `cases` list remains unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns the `results` list, which is populated with 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in the `cases` list based on the conditions checked in the loop. The `cases` list remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k`, and is followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked for each tuple in `cases`. The `cases` list remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the `results` list, which is populated with 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in the `cases` list based on the conditions checked in the loop. The `cases` list remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
