The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each tuple, `n` and `m` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), and `k` is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)). Each test case is followed by two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, with lengths `n` and `m`, respectively, and each element in `a` and `b` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6).

The function returns a list `results` populated with 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in the `cases` list based on the conditions checked in the loop. The `cases` list remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains three elements: `n`, `m`, and `k`, and is followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function returns a list `results` where each element is 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked for each tuple in `cases`. The `cases` list remains unchanged.**
