Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is responsible for making a query to the interactor. It takes four indices `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` and prints a query string in the format `? a b c d`. It then reads the response from the interactor, which is one of `<`, `=`, or `>`, and returns it.
   - The function correctly formats and prints the query, and it correctly reads and returns the response from the interactor.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is responsible for providing the final answer to the interactor. It takes two indices `a` and `b` and prints the answer in the format `! a b`.
   - The function correctly formats and prints the answer, and it does not return any value, which is expected as it is the final output.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function handles the main logic of the problem. It reads the integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the permutation.
   - If `n` is 2, it directly prints the answer `! 0 1` because the maximum XOR for a permutation of length 2 is always `p_0 \oplus p_1`.
   - For `n > 2`, it first finds the index `max_index` such that `p_max_index` is the largest value in the permutation. This is done by comparing `p_0 \mid p_max_index` with `p_0 \mid p_i` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`.
   - After finding `max_index`, it then finds the indices `min_indices` where `p_i` is the smallest value such that `p_max_index \mid p_min_indices[0]` is equal to `p_max_index \mid p_i`. This is done by comparing `p_max_index \mid p_min_indices[0]` with `p_max_index \mid p_i` for all `i` in the range `[0, n)`.
   - Finally, it selects the smallest index `min_index` from `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index` and prints the answer `! max_index min_index`.

**Issues and Analysis**:
- **Finding `max_index`**:
  - The function correctly identifies `max_index` by comparing `p_0 \mid p_max_index` with `p_0 \mid p_i` for all `i`. Since `p_0 \mid p_i` will be maximized when `p_i` is the largest value, this step is correct.
- **Finding `min_indices`**:
  - The function correctly identifies the indices where `p_i` is the smallest value such that `p_max_index \mid p_min_indices[0]` is equal to `p_max_index \mid p_i`. This step is also correct.
- **Selecting `min_index`**:
  - The function correctly selects the smallest index from `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index`. If all indices in `min_indices` are equal to `max_index`, it will still select the first index, which is `max_index` itself. This is a valid selection because the problem allows any pair of indices that maximizes the XOR.

**Query Count**:
- The function makes at most `2n` queries in the worst case:
  - `n` queries to find `max_index`.
  - `n` queries to find `min_indices`.
- Since the problem allows up to `3n` queries, the query count is within the limit.

**Conclusion**:
- The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It uses the interactor to find the indices that maximize the XOR value and does so within the allowed number of queries.

Correctness: **True**
