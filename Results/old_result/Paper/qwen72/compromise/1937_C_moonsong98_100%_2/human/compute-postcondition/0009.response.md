The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. The state of `max_index` and `min_indices` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`max_index` is `n-1`, `min_indices` is a list containing `[n-1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
