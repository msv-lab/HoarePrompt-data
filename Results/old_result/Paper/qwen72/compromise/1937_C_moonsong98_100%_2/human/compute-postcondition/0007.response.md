To determine the output state after the loop executes all iterations, let's analyze the loop and the function `func_1`:

1. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`.
2. In each iteration, the function `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` is called, and its result is stored in `res`.
3. If `res` is equal to `'< '`, then `max_index` is updated to `i`.

The key here is understanding what `func_1` does. Since the problem does not specify the implementation of `func_1`, we need to make an assumption based on the typical behavior of such functions. A common interpretation is that `func_1` compares the values of its third and fourth arguments (0 and `i` in this case) and returns `'< '` if the third argument is less than the fourth argument.

Given this assumption:
- `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` will return `'< '` if `0 < i`, which is true for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

Therefore, in each iteration where `i` is greater than 0, `max_index` will be updated to `i`. Since `i` starts from 0 and increases to `n-1`, the last value of `i` that will update `max_index` is `n-1`.

Thus, after the loop finishes, `max_index` will be `n-1`.

Output State: **`max_index` is `n-1`.**
