The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the string representation of `i`. The loop iterates over each character in the string representation of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` was the second digit of `i`, and `i` was `t + 2`.

To execute the loop one more time, `x` needs to be the next character in the string representation of `i`. Since `i` is `t + 2` and the loop is iterating over the digits of `i`, the next character in the string representation of `i` will be the third digit (if it exists).

However, since `i` is an integer and we are iterating over its string representation, the loop will continue to the next digit if `i` has more than two digits. If `i` has only two digits, the loop will terminate after the second iteration.

Given that `i` is `t + 2` and `t` can be as large as \(10^4\), `i` can have up to 5 digits. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the third digit of `i` (if it exists).

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[t + 1]` now equal to `values[t] + the sum of the digits of t + 1`, `i` is `t + 2`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the first and second digits of `i`, `values[i]` is now equal to `values[i - 1] + the sum of the digits of t + 1`, `x` is the third digit of `i` (if it exists)**
