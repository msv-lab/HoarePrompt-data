Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[t + 1]` now equal to `values[t] + sum_value_digits`, `i` is `t + 1`, `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `t + 1`, `x` is the last digit of `t + 1`.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`inf`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`values`**: After the loop completes, `values[t + 1]` is updated to `values[t] + sum_value_digits`, where `sum_value_digits` is the sum of the digits of `t + 1`.
- **`i`**: Remains `t + 1` as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`sum_value_digits`**: This variable accumulates the sum of the digits of `t + 1` as the loop iterates through each digit of `str(i)`.
- **`x`**: After the loop completes, `x` is the last digit of `t + 1`, as the loop iterates through each character of `str(i)` from the first to the last.
