The function `func_1` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it can be inferred that the function is designed to work within the context of test cases where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case. The function returns a value or values that are dependent on these constraints, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle test cases where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 for each test case. It returns a value or values based on these constraints.**
