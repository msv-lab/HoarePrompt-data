Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list of 200001 zeros with `values[i]` now equal to `values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits`, `i` is `t + 1`, `x` is the second character of `str(i)`, `sum_value_digits` is the integer value of the first digit of `str(t + 1)` plus the integer value of the second character of `str(i)`**

Explanation:
- The code `sum_value_digits += int(x)` updates the value of `sum_value_digits` by adding the integer value of `x` to it.
- `x` is the second character of `str(i)`, and `i` is `t + 1`.
- Therefore, `sum_value_digits` is now the integer value of the first digit of `str(t + 1)` plus the integer value of the second character of `str(i)`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
