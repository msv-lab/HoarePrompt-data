You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has chosen `x` vertices.
   - We can choose up to `y` additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the `x` vertices chosen by Bessie and sorts them.

3. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles that can be formed is `x + y - 2`. This is because each vertex can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, and we need to account for the fact that we are forming non-intersecting triangles.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices and checks the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it means we can form one additional triangle by adding a diagonal.
   - If the gap is even, it means we can potentially form more triangles by adding diagonals. The number of additional triangles is `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.

5. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertex:**
   - The program also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it means we can form one additional triangle by adding a diagonal.
   - If the gap is even, it means we can potentially form more triangles by adding diagonals. The number of additional triangles is `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.

6. **Optimizing the Number of Triangles:**
   - The program stores the potential additional triangles in a list `tmp`.
   - It sorts this list to prioritize the smallest gaps first.
   - It then iterates through the list `tmp` and adds the number of triangles that can be formed by using the available `y` vertices.
   - If `y` is sufficient to form the additional triangles, it updates `ans` and decreases `y` accordingly.
   - If `y` is not sufficient, it breaks out of the loop.

7. **Final Adjustment:**
   - The program adds any remaining `y` vertices to `ans`.
   - It ensures that the final answer does not exceed `n - 2`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed in a polygon with `n` sides.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the initial setup and the gaps between chosen vertices.
- It optimizes the number of triangles by prioritizing the smallest gaps first.
- The final adjustment ensures that the answer does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
