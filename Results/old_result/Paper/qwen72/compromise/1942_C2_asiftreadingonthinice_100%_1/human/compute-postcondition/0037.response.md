Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus `i`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` must have at least one element, and `y` is 0 or 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is decremented by `i - 1`.
- Given that `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, after the decrement, `y` will be either 0 or 1.
- The states of `a`, `i`, `ans`, and `tmp` remain unchanged.
