Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ans` remains as defined in the previous iteration, `tmp` now contains the value `(a[3] - a[2]) // 2` appended to it.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of the expression `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Since `i` is 3, the expression calculates the difference between the 4th and 3rd elements of the list `a`, divides this difference by 2 using integer division, and appends the result to `tmp`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.
