Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains undefined.***
