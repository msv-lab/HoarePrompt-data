Postcondition: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `len(a)` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `y` is the remainder after subtracting the appropriate values from `y` as per the loop's condition, `tmp` is an empty list, `ii` is `len(a)`, `tt` must be greater than `len(a)`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is not equal to 2.**
