The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and `tt`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `tt`. If `tt` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `ii` is not relevant to the function parameters or the constraints mentioned, but it must be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`func` is not properly defined, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0**
