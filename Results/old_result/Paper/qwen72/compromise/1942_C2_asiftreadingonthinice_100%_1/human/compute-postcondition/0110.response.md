Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` has been updated by adding the values of `i` from `tmp` for which `y` was greater than or equal to `i - 1`, plus the final value of `y`. `y` has been decreased by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all such values of `i`. `a` and `x` are unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii` for the loop to execute one more time. `n`, `x`, and `y` are reassigned to the integer values provided by the user input.**
