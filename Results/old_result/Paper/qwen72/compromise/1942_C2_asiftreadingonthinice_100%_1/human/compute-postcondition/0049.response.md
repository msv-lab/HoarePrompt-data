Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the current `i`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `y` remains less than `i - 1`, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` must have at least 1 element. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
