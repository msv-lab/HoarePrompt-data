Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between the third element (`a[2]`) and the second element (`a[1]`) of the list `a` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1. If the difference is not 2 but is an even number, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` remains undefined.***
