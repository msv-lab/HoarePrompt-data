Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, plus the value of `i`, `y` is 0, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `tmp` must contain at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by the value of `i`.
- The initial state of `a` being sorted in ascending order remains unchanged.
- The initial value of `y` remains 0.
- The value of `i` is still the next element in `tmp`.
- The precondition that `tmp` must contain at least one element remains valid.
