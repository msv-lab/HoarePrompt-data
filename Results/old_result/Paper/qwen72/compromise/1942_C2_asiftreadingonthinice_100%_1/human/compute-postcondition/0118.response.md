Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number but not equal to 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer value of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code appends the result of the integer division `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` to the list `tmp`. Since `i` is 1, the difference between `a[1]` and `a[0]` is an even number but not equal to 2, the value appended to `tmp` is the integer division of this difference by 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
