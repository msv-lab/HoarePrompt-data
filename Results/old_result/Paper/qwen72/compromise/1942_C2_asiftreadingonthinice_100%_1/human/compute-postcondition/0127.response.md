Output State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order and must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `ans` is increased by 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `ans += 1` increases the value of `ans` by 1. The initial conditions that `a` is sorted in ascending order with at least 4 elements and `i` is 3 remain unchanged. The specific conditions regarding the difference between `a[3]` and `a[2]` do not affect the execution of the code snippet, so `ans` is simply incremented by 1.
