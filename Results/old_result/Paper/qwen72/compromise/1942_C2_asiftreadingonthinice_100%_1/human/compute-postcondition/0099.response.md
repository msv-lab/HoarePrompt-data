The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `tmp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `tmp` and the next value of `i` in `tmp`.

At the end of the last iteration, `tmp` is a non-empty list containing specific values based on the conditions given. The variable `i` is the next element in `tmp` that was processed in the last iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next element in `tmp` after the last processed element.

Since `tmp` is a list and `i` is the next element in this list, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

- `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the last processed element.
- `tmp` remains the same list as it was at the end of the previous iteration, assuming no modifications are made to `tmp` within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`tmp` is a non-empty list containing the values of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, and if `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1])` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` includes the value `((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)`. `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the last processed element.**
