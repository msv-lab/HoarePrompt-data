Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] != 2`, the current value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2`. If `y >= i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i` (which is `len(a) - 1`), and `y` is set to 0. If `y < i - 1`, `ans` remains the initial value plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2`. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, `ans` is incremented by 1. `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `(a[j] - a[j - 1]) // 2` for all `j` where the difference between `a[j]` and `a[j - 1]` is an even number but not 2. If `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0` and `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] != 2`, the current value of `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` is appended to `tmp`. `tmp` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i`, `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`, and `i` is the next element in `tmp`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `y` is set to 0, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `tmp` must contain at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value of `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1`, `ans` is incremented by `i`, `i` is updated to the next element in `tmp`, and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y` is less than `i - 1`, `y` is set to 0, `i` is updated to the next element in `tmp`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
