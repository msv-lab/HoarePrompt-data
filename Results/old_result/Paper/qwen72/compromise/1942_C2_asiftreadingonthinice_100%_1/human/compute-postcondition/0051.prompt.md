Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2. If the difference between the first element of `a` and `a[len(a) - 1]` plus `n` is exactly 2, `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negation of the last element of `a` is even, `tmp` now includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`. The difference between the first element of `a` and `n` minus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2.
Code of the loop:
for i in tmp:
    if y >= i - 1:
        ans += i
        y -= i - 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` >= `i - 1`, `ans` is further increased by `i`, and `y` is 0 or 1. If `y` < `i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `y` remains less than `i - 1`. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` must have at least one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `tmp`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` >= `i - 1`, `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`. If `y` < `i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `y` remains less than `i - 1`. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` must have at least 2 elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in `tmp` after the current `i`, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2. If `y` >= `i - 1`, `ans` is further increased by `i` and `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`, ensuring `y` is now less than `i - 1`. If `y` < `i - 1`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `y` remains less than `i - 1`. `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer values of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` that are even but not equal to 2, each divided by 2, and `tmp` must have at least 1 element.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
