### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - **Anna's Move:** Anna can reverse any number in the list. This operation does not change the number of digits in the number, but it may change the number of trailing zeros.
   - **Sasha's Move:** Sasha can concatenate any two numbers in the list, reducing the list size by one. The concatenated number will have the sum of the digits of the two numbers.
   - **Winning Condition:** Sasha wins if the final number in the list has at least \(10^m\) digits. Otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Function `zerocnts` Analysis:**
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a number. It is used to determine how many zeros can be removed when a number is reversed.
   - The function works correctly by iterating from the end of the string representation of the number and counting zeros until a non-zero digit is encountered.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Total Digits Calculation:** The function calculates the total number of digits in the list of numbers using `sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.
   - **Trailing Zeros Count:** It then calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number using the `zerocnts` function and sorts these counts in descending order.
   - **Subtracting Trailing Zeros:** The function subtracts the trailing zeros at even indices from the total number of digits. This is done to simulate the effect of Anna's optimal play, where she would reverse numbers to minimize the number of trailing zeros that Sasha can use to his advantage.
   - **Winning Condition Check:** Finally, it checks if the adjusted total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - **Anna's Strategy:** Anna should reverse numbers with the most trailing zeros to minimize the number of trailing zeros that Sasha can concatenate.
   - **Sasha's Strategy:** Sasha should concatenate numbers to maximize the number of digits in the final number.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the total number of digits and the number of trailing zeros.
   - By subtracting the trailing zeros at even indices, the algorithm simulates Anna's optimal play.
   - The final check to determine the winner based on the adjusted total number of digits is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the optimal play of both players. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
