Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the total number of digits and how it handles the removal of trailing zeros.

1. **Digit Count Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list by summing the lengths of the string representations of the numbers (`tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`).
   - This is correct in terms of counting the total number of digits, but it doesn't account for the fact that Anna can reverse the digits of any number, which might change the number of digits (e.g., reversing 100 to 001 results in 1).

2. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
   - The function `zerocnts` is supposed to count the number of trailing zeros in a number. However, it is not used correctly in the main function `func_1`.
   - The program subtracts the number of trailing zeros from the total digit count in pairs (`for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`). This is incorrect because:
     - Sasha can concatenate any two numbers, not just pairs of numbers with trailing zeros.
     - The subtraction of trailing zeros should be done in a way that reflects the optimal play of both players, not just in pairs.

3. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the optimal play of both players. It assumes that Sasha will always concatenate pairs of numbers with the highest number of trailing zeros, which is not necessarily the optimal strategy.
   - Anna's strategy of reversing numbers is not considered in the context of how it affects the final concatenated number and the game's outcome.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly determine the winner, the program should:
- Simulate Anna's optimal move of reversing the digits of the smallest number (or a number that minimizes the impact on the total digit count).
- Simulate Sasha's optimal move of concatenating the two largest numbers (or the two numbers that maximize the total digit count).
- Continue this process until the list is reduced to a single number and check if the final number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).

The given program does not correctly implement these steps, leading to incorrect results for some test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
