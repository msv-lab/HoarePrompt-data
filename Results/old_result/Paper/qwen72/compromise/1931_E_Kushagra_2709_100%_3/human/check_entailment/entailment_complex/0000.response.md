### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a chosen integer.
   - Sasha concatenates two chosen integers and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when there is exactly one integer left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final integer is greater than or equal to \(10^m\), otherwise Anna wins.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, m, nums)`**:
     - This function calculates the total number of digits in the list `nums`.
     - It then sorts the list of trailing zero counts for each number in `nums` in descending order.
     - It subtracts the trailing zero counts at even indices from the total digit count.
     - Finally, it returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), otherwise it returns 'Anna'.
   - **`zerocnts(num)`**:
     - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Total Digit Count Calculation:**
     - The total number of digits in the list `nums` is correctly calculated using `sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))`.
   - **Trailing Zero Count:**
     - The function `zerocnts(num)` correctly counts the trailing zeros in the string representation of `num`.
   - **Adjusting Total Digit Count:**
     - The function `func_1` sorts the trailing zero counts in descending order and subtracts the counts at even indices from the total digit count. This is based on the idea that trailing zeros can be removed when concatenating numbers, and the subtraction at even indices is a way to simulate the removal of these zeros.
   - **Winning Condition:**
     - The function returns 'Sasha' if the adjusted total digit count is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), which is the correct condition for Sasha to win.

4. **Optimal Play:**
   - The logic of the game assumes that both players play optimally. The strategy of subtracting trailing zero counts at even indices from the total digit count is a valid approach to determine the winner under optimal play conditions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as single-element lists and large values of `m` correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `zerocnts` work together to calculate the total number of digits and adjust it by removing trailing zeros, which is a valid strategy for determining the winner under optimal play conditions.
