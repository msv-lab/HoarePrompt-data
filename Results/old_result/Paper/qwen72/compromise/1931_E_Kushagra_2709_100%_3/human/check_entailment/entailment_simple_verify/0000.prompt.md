You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, nums):

    tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'

#Function 2:
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        tot += 1
    return tot



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, m, nums))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer, and nums is a list of positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all a_i in nums.
def func_1(n, m, nums):
    tot = sum(len(val) for val in map(str, nums))
    cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)
    for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2):
        tot -= cntvals[i]
        
    #State: `n` remains a positive integer, `m` remains a non-negative integer, `nums` remains a list of positive integers with the same constraints, `tot` is reduced by the sum of the elements in `cntvals` at even indices, and `cntvals` remains the same sorted list of results of `zerocnts(val)` for each `val` in `nums`.
    return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'
    #The program returns 'Sasha' if the value of `tot` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`, otherwise it returns 'Anna'. Here, `tot` is the original value of `tot` reduced by the sum of the elements in `cntvals` at even indices, and `m` is a non-negative integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def zerocnts(num):
    num = str(num)
    tot = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] != '0':
            break
        
        tot += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `num` remains the same string representation of the original integer `num`, `tot` is the number of trailing zeros in `num`.
    return tot
    #The program returns the number of trailing zeros in the string representation of the original integer `num`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to count the number of trailing zeros in each number and then use this information to determine the winner. However, this approach does not align with the game rules, which involve reversing digits and concatenating numbers.

Here's a potential case where the program does not work correctly:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2
14 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output "Anna" because it only considers the number of trailing zeros, which does not affect the outcome of the game in this case.

**Explanation of the Case:**
- Anna can reverse the integer 2, which remains 2.
- Sasha can then concatenate 2 and 14 to form 214, which is greater than \(10^2 = 100\).
- Therefore, Sasha wins, but the program incorrectly outputs "Anna".

The program needs to simulate the actual game moves, including reversing digits and concatenating numbers, to determine the winner correctly. The current approach of counting trailing zeros and subtracting them in pairs does not capture the game's dynamics and can lead to incorrect results.
