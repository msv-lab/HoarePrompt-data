The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `num`. The loop will execute if the length of `num` is at least 1. The loop iterates from the last index of `num` down to 0. For the loop to execute, `num` must have at least one character, and `i` should start at `len(num) - 1`.

State: **`num` is a string representation of the original integer `num` that must have at least 1 character, `i` is `len(num) - 1`, `tot` is 0**
