t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers n, x, and y (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9), where n is the size of the array and x and y are Polycarp's favorite integers; the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), which are the elements of the array. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
