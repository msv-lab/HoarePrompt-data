To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`freq`**: This dictionary is updated to include the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with its value incremented by 1. However, the exact contents of `freq` are not necessary for the `print` statement.

2. **`t`**: A positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. It is not directly used in the `print` statement.

3. **`test_cases`**: A list of test cases with at least 2 test cases. The specific content of `test_cases` is not provided, but we know that `case` is the second test case in this list.

4. **`case`**: The second test case in the `test_cases` list. It contains a dictionary with a key `'params'` which is a list of parameters.

5. **`results`**: A list containing one element, `beautiful_count`.

6. **`n`**: The first element of `case['params']`.

7. **`x`**: The second element of `case['params']`.

8. **`y`**: The third element of `case['params']`.

9. **`a`**: A non-empty list, but its specific content is not provided.

10. **`mod_x`**: The remainder of the new `num` divided by `x`.

11. **`mod_y`**: The remainder of the new `num` divided by `y`.

12. **`required_mod_x`**: Calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.

13. **`required_mod_y`**: Equal to `mod_y`.

14. **`beautiful_count`**: Remains unchanged unless explicitly updated by the condition mentioned in the initial state.

Given the `print` statement:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

We need to determine the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y`.

- **`num`**: The value of `num` is not explicitly provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, it is assumed to be a number that is being processed.

- **`mod_x`**: The remainder when `num` is divided by `x`.

- **`mod_y`**: The remainder when `num` is divided by `y`.

- **`required_mod_x`**: Calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.

- **`required_mod_y`**: Equal to `mod_y`.

Since the exact value of `num` is not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** (where `num` is the value of `num`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`)
