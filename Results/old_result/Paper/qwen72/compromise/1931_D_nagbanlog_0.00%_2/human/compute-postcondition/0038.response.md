The code updates the `beautiful_count` variable by adding the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` to it. Given that `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 1, and `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x` which simplifies to `mod_x` (since `mod_x` is already the remainder of `num` divided by `x`), and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, the key `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` is the same as `(mod_x, mod_y)`. Therefore, `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` is 1.

Thus, `beautiful_count` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is 1, `beautiful_count` is incremented by 1.**
