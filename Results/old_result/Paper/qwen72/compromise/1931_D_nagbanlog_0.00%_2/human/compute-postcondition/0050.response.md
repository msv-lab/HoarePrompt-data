Output State: **`freq` is an empty dictionary, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is now equal to `case['array']`, `beautiful_count` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `beautiful_count` to 0. This affects only the `beautiful_count` variable, setting it to 0. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
