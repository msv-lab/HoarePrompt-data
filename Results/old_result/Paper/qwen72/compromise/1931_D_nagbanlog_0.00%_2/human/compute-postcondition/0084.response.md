Output State: **`required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by `freq[(x - mod_x) % x, mod_y]`. `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is set to 0. The conditions and values for `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, and the potential increment of `beautiful_count` remain unchanged.
