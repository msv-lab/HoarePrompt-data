Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder when `num` is divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`, `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x` updates the value of `required_mod_x` to be the result of `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- All other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `case`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_y`, and `freq`) remain unchanged or are already defined in the initial state.
- The value of `freq[(mod_x, mod_y)]` is incremented by 1, which means the count for the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` is increased by 1.
