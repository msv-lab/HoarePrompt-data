Output State: **`freq` is updated to include the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` with its value set to 0, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `results` is a list containing one element which is `beautiful_count`, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a non-empty list, `mod_x` is the remainder of the new `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of the new `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, `beautiful_count` is incremented by the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]`. Otherwise, `beautiful_count` remains unchanged.** 

Explanation:
- The code `freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0` sets the value of the key `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the dictionary `freq` to 0.
- All other variables and their relationships remain unchanged from the initial state.
