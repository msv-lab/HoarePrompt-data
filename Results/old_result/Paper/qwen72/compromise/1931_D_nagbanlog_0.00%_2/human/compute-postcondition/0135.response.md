Output State: **The program returns the list `results` which contains `t` elements, where each element is the `beautiful_count` for the corresponding test case. Each `beautiful_count` represents the total count of numbers in the array `a` that can be paired with another number in `a` such that their sum is divisible by `x` and has a remainder of `mod_y` when divided by `y`.**
