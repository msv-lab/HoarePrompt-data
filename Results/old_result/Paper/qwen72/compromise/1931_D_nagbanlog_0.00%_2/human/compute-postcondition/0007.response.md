To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects present in the loop head, which in this case is `num` and `a`.

- The variable `num` is the iterator that will take on the values from the list `a`.
- The list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is derived from `case['array']`, which is part of the `test_cases` list.
- `test_cases` is specified to have at least 1 test case, and `case` is the first test case in the list.
- Therefore, `a` should have at least one element for the loop to execute.

So, for the loop to execute, the list `a` must have at least one element. The variable `num` will start as the first element of `a`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `case` is the first test case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is equal to `case['params'][0]`, `x` is equal to `case['params'][1]`, `y` is equal to `case['params'][2]`, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `beautiful_count` is 0, `num` is the first element of `a`**
