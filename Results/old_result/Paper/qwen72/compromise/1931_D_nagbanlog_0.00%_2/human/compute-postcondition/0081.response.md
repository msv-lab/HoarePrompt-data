To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `required_mod_x` is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`.
- `required_mod_y` is simply `mod_y`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(
    f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`num`**: This variable is mentioned in the print statement but not defined in the initial state. Therefore, its value is unknown.
2. **`mod_x`**: This variable is mentioned in the print statement but not defined in the initial state. Therefore, its value is unknown.
3. **`mod_y`**: This variable is mentioned in the print statement but not defined in the initial state. Therefore, its value is unknown.
4. **`required_mod_x`**: This is calculated as `(x - mod_x) % x`. Since `x` and `mod_x` are not explicitly defined, we can only describe it in terms of these variables.
5. **`required_mod_y`**: This is simply `mod_y`.

### Final Output:
The print statement will output the values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` as described above. Since `num`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` are not explicitly defined, we will use placeholders to represent their values.

Output: **Number: [num], mod_x: [mod_x], mod_y: [mod_y], required_mod_x: [(x - mod_x) % x], required_mod_y: [mod_y]** (where `num`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` are the values of the respective variables, and `x` is the value of the variable used in the calculation of `required_mod_x`).
