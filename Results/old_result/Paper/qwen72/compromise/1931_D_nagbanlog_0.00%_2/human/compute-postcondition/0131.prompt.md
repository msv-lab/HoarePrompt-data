Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `freq` is an empty dictionary `{}`, `beautiful_count` is 0, `results` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`, `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is updated to the value of `case['array']`, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(
        f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}'
        )
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `freq` is updated such that the value of `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1. `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is a key in `freq`. `results` remains unchanged, `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`, `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`, `a` is a non-empty list, `num` is the first element of `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`, and `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`. If `(mod_x, mod_y)` was not initially in `freq`, it is now a key with a value of `1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1; `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` plus the previous value of `beautiful_count` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `results` remains unchanged; `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`; `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is a non-empty list; `num` is the second element of `a`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`; `mod_y` is the new remainder of `num` divided by `y`; `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1; `beautiful_count` is either 0 or the value of `freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]` plus the previous value of `beautiful_count` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains unchanged; `results` remains unchanged; `n`, `x`, and `y` are updated to the values of `case['params']`; `case` is now the next element in `test_cases`; `a` is a non-empty list; `num` is the third element of `a`; `required_mod_x` is `(x - mod_x) % x`; `required_mod_y` is `mod_y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
