Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for constructing the sequence `nums` may fail to ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of `k` while also ensuring that all other values from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) have a subsequence that sums to them.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
5 3
```

The program constructs the sequence as follows:
1. `nums = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]`
2. `idx = 1` (since `3 >= 2` and `3 < 4`)
3. `nums.append(3 - 2) = nums.append(1)`
4. `nums.append(3 + 1) = nums.append(4)`
5. `nums.append(3 + 2 + 1) = nums.append(6)`
6. `nums.remove(2)`

The resulting sequence is:
```
[1, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 1, 4, 6]
```

However, this sequence does not meet the requirements:
- The sequence contains `1` twice, which means there are multiple subsequences that sum to 1.
- The sequence does not contain a subsequence that sums to 2, which is required since `2` is between 1 and 5 and `2` is not equal to `3`.

Thus, the program does not work correctly for this input.
