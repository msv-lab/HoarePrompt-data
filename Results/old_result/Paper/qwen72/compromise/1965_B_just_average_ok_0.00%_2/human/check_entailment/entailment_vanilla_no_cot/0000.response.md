Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not always generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. Here are the issues:

1. **Sequence Construction Logic**: The program constructs a sequence by starting with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) and then modifies it to avoid a subsequence sum of \(k\). However, the logic for modifying the sequence to avoid a subsequence sum of \(k\) is flawed.

2. **Removal and Addition of Elements**: The program removes \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from the sequence and adds \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) to the sequence. This approach does not guarantee that no subsequence will sum to \(k\), and it may introduce other subsequences that sum to \(k\).

3. **Ensuring All Other Sums**: The program does not ensure that for all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of the sequence that sums to \(v\). The sequence generated by the program may not cover all required sums.

4. **Size Constraint**: The program appends three additional elements to the sequence, which can potentially exceed the size limit of 25 if the initial sequence already has 24 elements.

To correctly solve the problem, a more robust approach is needed to ensure that the sequence meets both conditions: no subsequence sums to \(k\) and all other sums from 1 to \(n\) (excluding \(k\)) are achievable.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = []
        for i in range(24):
            if (1 << i) > n:
                break
            nums.append(1 << i)
        
        # Ensure no subsequence sums to k
        if k in nums:
            nums.remove(k)
        
        # Add k + 1 to the sequence to ensure all sums from 1 to n are covered
        if k + 1 <= n:
            nums.append(k + 1)
        
        # Ensure the sequence size does not exceed 25
        while len(nums) > 25:
            nums.pop()
        
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Constructs a sequence of powers of 2 up to \(n\).
- Removes \(k\) from the sequence if it is present.
- Adds \(k + 1\) to the sequence to ensure all other sums are covered.
- Ensures the sequence size does not exceed 25 by removing excess elements if necessary.

This approach should meet the problem's requirements correctly.
