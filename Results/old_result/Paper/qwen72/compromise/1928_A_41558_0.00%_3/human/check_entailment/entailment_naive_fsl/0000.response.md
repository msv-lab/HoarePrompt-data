Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program fails to handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even and equal. According to the problem description, if the original rectangle is 2x2, it can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle, which is different from the original 2x2 rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for such cases because it checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a` and prints "NO" if either condition is true. This condition should not prevent the program from outputting "YES" when both `a` and `b` are even and equal.

Example input:
```
1
2 2
```
Expected output:
```
YES
```
Actual output:
```
NO
```
