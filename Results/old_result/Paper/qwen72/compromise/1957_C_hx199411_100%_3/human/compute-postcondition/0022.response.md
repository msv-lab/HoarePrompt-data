Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k`. Otherwise, `num` is `2k - m`, where `m` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `k` iterations:
- The value of `t` remains `t - 1` (unchanged from the initial state).
- The value of `n` and `k` remain the same as provided by the user input.
- The value of `i` is `k-1`, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
- The value of `c` and `r` are the last pair of integers provided by the user input for the `k`-th move.
- The value of `num` is determined by the number of times `c` was equal to `r` during the `k` iterations. If `c` was equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k`. Otherwise, `num` is `2k - m`, where `m` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r`. This means that for each move where `c` was not equal to `r`, `num` increased by 2, and for each move where `c` was equal to `r`, `num` increased by 1.
