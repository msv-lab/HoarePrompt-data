Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 <= r_i, c_i <= n, and all moves are valid.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, but the values and conditions of `n`, `k`, and the moves represented by `r_i` and `c_i` remain unchanged.
