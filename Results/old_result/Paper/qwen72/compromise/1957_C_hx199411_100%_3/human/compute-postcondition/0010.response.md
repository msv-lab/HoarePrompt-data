Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `num` is 2, `i` is 0, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, and `c` is not equal to `r`.**
