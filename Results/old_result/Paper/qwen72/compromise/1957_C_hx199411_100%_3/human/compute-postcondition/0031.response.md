Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is `k-1`, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. `m` is not equal to 0. `m` is not equal to 1. If `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, `num` is `k` and `m` is `n - k`. Otherwise, `num` is `2k - m`, where `m` is the number of times `c` was equal to `r`, and `m` is `n - (2k - m)`. `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, and `dp[1]` is 1.**
