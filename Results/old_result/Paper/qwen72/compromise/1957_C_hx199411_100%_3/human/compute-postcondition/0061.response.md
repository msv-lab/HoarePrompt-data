Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 2, `k` must be greater than 2. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 2. Otherwise, `num` is 4. If `m` is 0, `m` is `n - k` regardless of whether `c` is equal to `r` or not. If `m` is 1, `m` is `n - k` if `c` is equal to `r` for all `k` moves, otherwise `m` is `n - (2k - m)`. `dp` is a list of `m + 1` integers with the specified values if `m` is not 1.** 

Explanation: The code snippet `c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from user input and assigns them to `c` and `r`. The values of `c` and `r` are now updated to the integers provided by the user. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
