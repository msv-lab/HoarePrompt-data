The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `m`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4, and `m` must still be greater than or equal to 3 to ensure `i` is less than `m + 1`.

State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 4, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, and `dp[3]` is `(dp[2] + 2 * dp[1]) % (10`**
