Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 2` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r` over all `k` iterations, `m` is `n - num`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `m` is updated to `n - num`.
- All other variables (`c`, `r`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `i`, `num`) retain their initial values and conditions.
- The specific value of `m` depends on the values of `n` and `num`, but it is now explicitly defined as `n - num`.
