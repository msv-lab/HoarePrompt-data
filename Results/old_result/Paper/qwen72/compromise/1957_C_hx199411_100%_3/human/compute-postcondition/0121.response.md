Output State: **`c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `t` is now `t - 3` and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 4, `num` is the total number of times `c` was equal to `r` plus twice the number of times `c` was not equal to `r`, `m` is `n - num` and must be greater than or equal to 3, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 5, and `dp[4]` is `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` which evaluates to 23.**

Explanation:
- The value of `dp[i]` is updated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Given `i` is 4, `dp[4]` is calculated as `(dp[3] + 3 * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Substituting the known values: `dp[3]` is 5, `dp[2]` is 3, and `i - 1` is 3.
- The calculation becomes: `(5 + 3 * 3 * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Simplifying inside the parentheses: `(5 + 18) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
- Further simplification: `23 % (10 ** 9 + 7)` which is 23.
- Therefore, `dp[4]` is 23. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
