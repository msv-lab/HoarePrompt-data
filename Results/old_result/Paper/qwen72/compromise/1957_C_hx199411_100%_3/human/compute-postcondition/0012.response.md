The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `k`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `k` is an integer provided by the user input. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1, and `k` must remain greater than 0.

State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid; `i` is 1, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input. If `c` is equal to `r`, `num` is 1. Otherwise, `num` is 2.**
