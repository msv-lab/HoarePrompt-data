Initial State: `t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 4, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8.

The code snippet:
```
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

Step-by-step impact:
1. `i` is 4.
2. `dp[4]` is calculated using the formula: `dp[4] = (dp[3] + (4 - 1) * dp[2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.
3. `dp[3]` is 8.
4. `(4 - 1)` is 3.
5. `dp[2]` is 3.
6. The expression inside the parentheses becomes: `8 + 3 * 3 * 2`.
7. `3 * 3 * 2` is 18.
8. `8 + 18` is 26.
9. `26 % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is 26 (since 26 is less than 10^9 + 7).

Therefore, the value of `dp[4]` is 26.

Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the user input, each of the `k` moves is represented by two integers `r_i` and `c_i`, where `1 <= r_i, c_i <= n`, and all moves are valid, `i` is 4, `c` and `r` are integers provided by the user input, `m` must be at least 4, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 8, `dp[4]` is 26.**
