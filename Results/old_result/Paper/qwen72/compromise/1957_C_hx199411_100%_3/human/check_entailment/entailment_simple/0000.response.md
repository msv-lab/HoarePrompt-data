### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.

2. **Counting Mirrored Moves:**
   - The program initializes `num` to 0, which is used to count the number of positions that are either occupied by a rook or cannot be occupied due to the mirrored move rule.
   - For each of the `k` moves, it reads the coordinates `c` and `r` of the white rook placed by the player.
   - If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1 because the computer skips its turn.
   - If `c != r`, it increments `num` by 2 because both the player and the computer place rooks, occupying two positions.

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The program calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions that can be occupied by rooks without violating the no-attack rule.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Final Configurations:**
   - The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations.
   - It initializes a list `dp` of length `m + 1` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3, which are the base cases for the number of configurations when there is 1 or 2 remaining positions.
   - For each `i` from 3 to `m`, it updates `dp[i]` using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`. This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the mirrored move rule.

5. **Output:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the program prints 1, which is correct because there is only one way to place the rooks in these cases.
   - If `m` is greater than 1, the program prints `dp[m]`, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of possible final configurations based on the given problem description and constraints. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, and the base cases and the recurrence relation are correctly defined.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True****
