### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves.

2. **Move Counting:**
   - The program counts the number of moves where `r_i` equals `c_i` (denoted as `num`). For each such move, the computer skips its turn, so these moves do not affect the number of available positions.
   - For each move where `r_i` does not equal `c_i`, the program increments `num` by 2, accounting for both the player's move and the computer's mirrored move.

3. **Remaining Moves Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `m` as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions on the board that are not attacked by any rook.

4. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the program correctly prints 1 because there are no more moves to make or only one position left, respectively.
   - For `m` greater than 1, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of possible final configurations:
     - `dp[1]` is initialized to 1, representing the single configuration when there is only one remaining position.
     - `dp[2]` is initialized to 3, representing the three possible configurations when there are two remaining positions.
     - For `i` from 3 to `m`, the program updates `dp[i]` using the formula:
       \[
       dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)
       \]
       This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering both the player's and the computer's moves.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid final configurations based on the given problem description. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for this problem, and the formula used to update `dp[i]` is correct. The program also handles edge cases (when `m` is 0 or 1) correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
