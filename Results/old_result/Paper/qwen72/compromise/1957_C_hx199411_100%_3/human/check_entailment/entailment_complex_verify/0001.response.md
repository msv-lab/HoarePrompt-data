### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. This means no two rooks can be in the same row or column.
   - The player places a white rook, and the computer mirrors the move by placing a black rook at the transposed position.
   - If the player places a rook on a diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)), the computer skips its turn.
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), the size of the board and the number of initial moves.
   - It then reads \( k \) pairs of coordinates \( (c, r) \) representing the initial moves.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Counting Initial Rooks:**
   - The program counts the number of rooks already placed on the board by iterating through the \( k \) moves.
   - If the move is on a diagonal (i.e., \( c == r \)), it increments `num` by 1.
   - If the move is not on a diagonal, it increments `num` by 2 (one for the player's move and one for the computer's move).
   - This part is also correct. It accurately counts the number of rooks placed and the corresponding mirrored moves.

4. **Calculating Remaining Moves:**
   - The program calculates \( m = n - num \), which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.
   - This calculation is correct. It correctly determines the number of remaining positions after accounting for the initial moves and their mirrors.

5. **Dynamic Programming for Remaining Moves:**
   - If \( m \) is 0 or 1, the program prints 1, as there is only one possible configuration.
   - For \( m \geq 2 \), the program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations.
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized with `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation used is \( dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

6. **Recurrence Relation Explanation:**
   - \( dp[i] \) represents the number of ways to place \( i \) rooks on an \( i \times i \) board.
   - \( dp[i - 1] \) accounts for the configurations where the \( i \)-th rook is placed in a new row and column.
   - \( (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2] \times 2 \) accounts for the configurations where the \( i \)-th rook is placed in a row or column that already has a rook, and the computer's mirrored move is considered.
   - This recurrence relation is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements. It correctly captures the number of ways to place rooks while ensuring no two rooks attack each other.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `dp[m]` for each test case, which represents the number of possible configurations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - This output is correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles the input, counts the initial rooks, and uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The recurrence relation and the logic for handling the initial moves are sound and align with the problem's requirements.

Final: **True**
