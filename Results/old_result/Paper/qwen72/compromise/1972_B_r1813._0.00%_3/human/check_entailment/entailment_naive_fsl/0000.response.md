Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the special case when there are only two coins left, and both are facing up. According to the problem description, if there are only two coins left, one will be removed, and the other won't be flipped. However, the current logic in the program does not account for this specific rule. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
UU
```
The program will output "YES" because it sees an odd number of 'U' coins. However, the correct output should be "NO" because when Alice removes one 'U' coin, the other 'U' coin remains and is not flipped, leaving Bob with the last 'U' coin, and Alice loses.
