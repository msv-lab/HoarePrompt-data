The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s`. The integer `n` represents the number of coins, with the constraint that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the string `s` represents the state of the coins, where each character in the string is either "U" (up) or "D" (down).

The function returns the number of operations required to make all coins face the same direction (either all up or all down) for each test case. The return value is a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the number of operations needed for the respective test case.
