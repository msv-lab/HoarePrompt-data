Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, where `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[r] -= mi` updates the value of `a[n - 1]` by subtracting `mi` from it.
- `r` is `n - 1`, so `a[r]` is `a[n - 1]`.
- `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`.
- After the execution, `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
