Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[n - 1]` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`, `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`. If `a[0]` is 0, `l` is updated to 1, `r` remains `n - 1`, `ans` is updated to 1, and `a[0]` remains 0. If `a[n - 1]` is 0, `r` is updated to `n - 2`, `ans` is updated to 1, and `a[n - 1]` is 0. If `mi * 2 > k`, `t` is set to `k % 2`. If `mi - t - k // 2` is 0, `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `l` is 1 if `a[l]` is 0, and `r` is `n - 2` if `a[n - 1]` is 0, otherwise `r` remains `n - 1`. If both `a[l]` and `a[n - 1]` are 0, `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is the remainder of `k` divided by 2, `ans` is 1 if `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0 or 1, `r` is `n - 1` or `n - 2`, `ans` is 0, 1, or 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `l` must be less than `r`. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `a[l]` is now `a[l] - mi`, `a[r]` is now `a[r] - mi`, and `k` is now `k - (mi * 2)`. If `a[r]` is 0, then `r` is decremented by 1 and `ans` is now 1, 2, or 3. If `a[l]` is 0, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `mi * 2 > k`, then `t` is now the remainder of `k` divided by 2. If `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0, 1, or 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
