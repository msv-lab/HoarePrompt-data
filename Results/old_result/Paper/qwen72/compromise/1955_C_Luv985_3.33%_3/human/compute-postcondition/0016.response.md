Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is an input integer and `k` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[r] -= mi` subtracts the value of `mi` from the element at index `r` in the list `a`.
- `r` is `n - 1`, so the element at index `n - 1` in the list `a` is updated to `a[n - 1] - mi`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
