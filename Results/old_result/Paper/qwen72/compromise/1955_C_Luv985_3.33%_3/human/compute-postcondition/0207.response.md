The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `pairs`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `pairs` is a list of pairs (n, k), where each pair represents the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks by the Kraken `k`. The constraints for `n` and `k` are 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, respectively.
- `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers representing the durability of the ships. The constraints for each ship's durability `a_i` are 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The length of `pairs` and `a` should be equal to `t`.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, the function calculates the number of ships that remain intact after `k` attacks by the Kraken.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of pairs (n, k) where each pair represents the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, and a list of lists `a` where each inner list contains the durability of the ships. It returns a list of results, where each result is the number of ships that remain intact after the specified number of attacks for each test case.**
