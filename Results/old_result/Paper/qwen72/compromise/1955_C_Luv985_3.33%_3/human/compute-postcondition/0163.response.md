Output State: **`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is `k % 2`.**

The value of `t` is now the remainder of `k` divided by 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
