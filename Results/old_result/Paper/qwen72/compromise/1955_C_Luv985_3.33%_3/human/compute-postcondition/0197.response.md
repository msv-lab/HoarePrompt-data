Output State: **`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 unless `a[0]` is 0, in which case `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 1 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, `t` is `k % 2`.**
