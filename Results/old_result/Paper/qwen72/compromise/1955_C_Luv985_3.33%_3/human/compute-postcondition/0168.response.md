Postcondition: ***`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2`. `ans` is 0 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is set to `k % 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
