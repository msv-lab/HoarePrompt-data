Postcondition: ***`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is 0 or less than the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]` multiplied by 2, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is the index of the first non-zero element from the left or `n` if all elements are zero, `r` is the index of the first non-zero element from the right or `-1` if all elements are zero, and `ans` is the number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0 or negative, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged.***
