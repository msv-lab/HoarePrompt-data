Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `ans` is 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, `ans` is incremented by 1 if `a[l]` is 0 or negative, otherwise `ans` remains 0.
Code of the loop:
while l < r and k > 0:
    mi = min(a[l], a[r])
    if mi * 2 <= k:
        a[l] -= mi
        a[r] -= mi
        k -= mi * 2
        if a[l] == 0:
            ans += 1
            l += 1
        if a[r] == 0:
            ans += 1
            r -= 1
    else:
        t = k % 2
        if mi - t - k // 2 == 0:
            ans += 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2`. `ans` is 0 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is decreased by `mi * 2`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`. If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, `t` is set to `k % 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 unless `a[0]` is 0, in which case `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 0 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 1. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - mi * 2`, `a[0]` and `a[r]` are both decreased by `mi`, and `ans` is 1 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2, and if `a[0]` is 0 and the last element of `a` is 0, `ans` is 3. If `mi * 2 > k`, then `k` remains greater than 0, `ans` is 1 if `mi - T - k // 2 == 0` unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2, and `t` is set to `k % 2`. In all cases, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[r]`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`T` is a truthy value decreased by 1, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 0 unless `a[0]` is 0, in which case `l` is 1 or 2 if `a[l]` was 0, `r` is `n - 1` unless the last element of `a` is 0, in which case `r` is `n - 2` or `n - 3` if `a[r]` was 0, `ans` is 0 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 1, 2, or 3 if `a[l]` or `a[r]` was 0. If `mi * 2 <= k`, then `k` is updated to `k - 2 * mi`, `a[l]` is updated to `a[l] - mi`, and `a[r]` is updated to `a[r] - mi`. If `mi * 2 > k` and `mi - t - k // 2 == 0`, then `ans` is 1 unless the first or last element of `a` is 0, in which case `ans` is 2. `mi` is the minimum value between `a[l]` and `a[r]`, and `t` is `k % 2`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
