Output State: **`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is `k - 2 * mi`, `a` is a list of integers, `l` is 1, `r` is `n - 2`, `ans` is 2, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, `a[0]` is `a[0] - mi`, and `a[n - 1]` is `a[n - 1] - mi`. The first element of `a` (i.e., `a[l]`) is 0. The second-to-last element of `a` (i.e., `a[r]`) is 0.**
