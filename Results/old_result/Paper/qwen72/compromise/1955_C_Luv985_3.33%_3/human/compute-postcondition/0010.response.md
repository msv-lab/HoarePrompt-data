Output State: **`T` is an input integer and `T - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a list of pairs `(n, k)`, `a` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

The value of `r` is now `n - 1`, where `n` is the input integer. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
