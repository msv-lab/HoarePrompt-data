Postcondition: **`T` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers converted from the list of strings from the input, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is 0, `mi` is the minimum value between `a[0]` and `a[n - 1]`, and the value of `mi` is such that `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`.**
