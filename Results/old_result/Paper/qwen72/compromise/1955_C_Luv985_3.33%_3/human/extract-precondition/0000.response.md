Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t, a list of pairs (n, k), and a list of lists a. t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each pair (n, k) in the list of pairs represents the number of ships and the number of attacks by the Kraken, with 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15. Each list in a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, representing the durability of the ships, with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The length of the list of pairs and the list of lists a should be equal to t. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
