### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the total score `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is odd. If it is, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (each game contributes either 2 points in a win/loss or 2 points in a draw).
   - This check is correct because the sum of points in any valid set of games must be even.

3. **Handling the Case Where the Highest Score is Greater Than or Equal to the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is because the maximum number of draws that can occur is when the two players with the lowest scores play against each other and all their games end in draws.
   - This is correct because if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the remaining points can be distributed in a way that all games between `p1` and `p2` are draws.

4. **Handling the Case Where the Highest Score is Less Than the Sum of the Other Two:**
   - The program calculates the minimum and maximum differences between `p3` and the other two scores (`p1` and `p2`).
   - It then iterates from `low` to `high` to find a valid number of draws. The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is used to check if the current number of draws is valid.
   - If a valid number of draws is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3`.
   - If no valid number of draws is found, it prints `p3`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where no games were played (e.g., `0 0 0`) correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where the scores are not consistent (e.g., `1 1 10`) correctly by printing `-1`.

### Detailed Analysis of the Iterative Approach:
- The iterative approach in the `else` block is intended to find the maximum number of draws when `p3 < p1 + p2`.
- The condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` ensures that the remaining points can be distributed in a way that is consistent with the rules of the game.
- However, the logic for calculating the number of draws in this block is flawed. The expression `p1 - cur + p3` does not correctly represent the maximum number of draws. Instead, the correct approach should be to calculate the maximum number of draws directly using the formula `min((p1 + p2 + p3) // 2, p1 + p2)`.

### Corrected Logic:
- For the case where `p3 < p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws can be calculated as `min((p1 + p2 + p3) // 2, p1 + p2)`.
- This formula ensures that the total number of draws is maximized while still being consistent with the total points and the rules of the game.

### Final Evaluation:
- The initial assessment is partially correct. It correctly identifies the need to check if the total score is even and handles the case where `p3 >= p1 + p2`.
- However, the iterative approach in the `else` block is incorrect and should be replaced with a direct calculation.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            print(min((p1 + p2 + p3) // 2, p1 + p2))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the `else` block. The corrected program will produce the expected output for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
