Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` representing the scores of three players in non-decreasing order. It then prints a value based on the following conditions: If the sum of the scores is odd, it prints -1. If the highest score `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two scores, it prints the sum of `p1` and `p2`. Otherwise, it calculates a value that balances the scores and prints it. After processing all `t` test cases, the function terminates. **
