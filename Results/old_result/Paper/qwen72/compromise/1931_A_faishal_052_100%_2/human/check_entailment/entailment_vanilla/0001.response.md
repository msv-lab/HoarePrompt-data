### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word whose letter indices sum up to a given integer `n`.
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2, ..., 'z' is 26.
   - The goal is to find the smallest possible combination of three letters that sum to `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which is the encoded value.
   - It initializes an empty list `arr` to store the indices of the letters.
   - It then tries to fill `arr` with the largest possible values first, ensuring the sum of the indices equals `lex`.

3. **Key Steps in the Program:**
   - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 28 and 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 52 and 78, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After filling `arr` with two values, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - It sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - Finally, it converts the indices in `arr` to characters and prints the resulting word.

4. **Issues with the Program:**
   - The logic for handling the cases where `lex` is less than 28, between 28 and 52, and between 52 and 78 is not optimal.
   - The program does not correctly handle the edge cases and may not always produce the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program might incorrectly append 1, 1, and 22 instead of 1, 1, and 22 in the correct order.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start by trying to use the smallest possible values for the first two letters and adjust the third letter accordingly.
   - We can use a loop to try different combinations and ensure the sum is correct while maintaining the lexicographical order.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly handle all edge cases and may not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
