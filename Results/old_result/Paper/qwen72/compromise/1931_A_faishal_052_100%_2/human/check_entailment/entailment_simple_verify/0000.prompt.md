You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `cases` will have its original value (as it is not modified within the loop), `i` will be equal to `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` will be 2 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` will be the last input integer processed (unchanged from its final modification), and `info` will contain a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, structured as follows: For each input `lex`, if `lex` is less than 28, the list will be `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list will be `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list will be `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `cases` remains unchanged, `i` equals `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations), `j` is 3 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop), `lex` is the last input integer processed, and `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs. The structure of each list in `info` is determined by the value of `lex`: if `lex` is less than 28, the list is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), the list is `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`; if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), the list is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`. Each list in `info` is sorted in ascending order. The variable `temp` is the string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[cases-1][0] + 96`, `info[cases-1][1] + 96`, and `info[cases-1][2] + 96`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to determine the values of `arr` does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Here is a counterexample:

For the input `n = 48`, the correct output should be `auz` (since `a` has index 1, `u` has index 21, and `z` has index 26, and 1 + 21 + 26 = 48). However, the program outputs `azz` (since it incorrectly assigns the values 1, 26, and 21 to `arr` and then sorts them, resulting in `1, 21, 26` which corresponds to `azz`).

The issue lies in the way the program tries to distribute the remaining value of `lex` among the three positions in `arr`. It does not ensure that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first two positions before assigning the remaining value to the third position. This leads to incorrect results in some cases.
