Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic used to determine the values of `arr` does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word. Here is a counterexample:

For the input `n = 48`, the correct output should be `auz` (since `a` has index 1, `u` has index 21, and `z` has index 26, and 1 + 21 + 26 = 48). However, the program outputs `azz` (since it incorrectly assigns the values 1, 26, and 21 to `arr` and then sorts them, resulting in `1, 21, 26` which corresponds to `azz`).

The issue lies in the way the program tries to distribute the remaining value of `lex` among the three positions in `arr`. It does not ensure that the smallest possible values are assigned to the first two positions before assigning the remaining value to the third position. This leads to incorrect results in some cases.
