The value `1` is appended to the list `arr`. The conditions for `arr` based on the value of `lex` remain unchanged, but now `arr` includes an additional element.

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` was initially `[1]` and becomes `[1, 1]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` was initially `[26]` and becomes `[26, 1]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 51:
  - If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` was initially an empty list `[]` and becomes `[1]`.
  - Otherwise, `arr` was initially `[26]` and becomes `[26, 1]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `lex` is an input integer, and `arr` is updated as follows: if `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1]`; if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 1]`; if `lex` is greater than 51, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex` is greater than 78, otherwise `arr` is `[26, 1]`.**
