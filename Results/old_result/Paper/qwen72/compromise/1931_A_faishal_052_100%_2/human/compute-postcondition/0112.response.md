The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. The conditions for `info` and `arr` depend on the original value of `lex` before the decrement. After the decrement:

- If the original `lex` was less than 28, the new `lex` will be less than 2 (since 28 - 26 = 2), so `info` remains `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` remains `[1, 26]`.
- If the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), the new `lex` will be between 2 and 26 (inclusive), so `info` remains `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` and `arr` remains `[26, 26]`.
- If the original `lex` was 52 or greater, the new `lex` will be 26 or greater, so `info` remains `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` and `arr` remains `[26]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 26`. If the original `lex` was less than 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If the original `lex` was 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]` and `arr` is `[26]`.**
