The value of `lex` is decremented by 26. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`, and `arr`) remain unchanged. The specific value of `lex` after the decrement depends on its initial value.

- If the initial `lex` was less than 28, it will now be less than 2 (specifically, `lex - 26`).
- If the initial `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), it will now be between 2 and 26 (specifically, `lex - 26`).
- If the initial `lex` was between 52 and 78 (inclusive), it will now be between 26 and 52 (specifically, `lex - 26`).
- If the initial `lex` was 78 or greater, it will now be 52 or greater (specifically, `lex - 26`).

The array `arr` will be updated based on the new value of `lex` as follows:
- If the new `lex` is less than 28, `arr` will be `[1, 1, 26]`.
- If the new `lex` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 1, 26]`.
- If the new `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` will be `[1, 26, 26]`.
- If the new `lex` is 78 or greater, `arr` will be `[26, 26]`.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `info` retains its initial value, `lex` is `lex - 26`, and `arr` is updated based on the new value of `lex` as described above.**
