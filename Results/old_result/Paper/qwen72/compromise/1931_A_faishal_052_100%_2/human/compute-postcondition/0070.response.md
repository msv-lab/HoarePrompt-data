Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78. If `lex` is less than 28, `info` is updated to [[1, 1, 1, lex - 4]], and `arr` is set to [1]. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `info` is set to [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` is set to [26]. If `lex` is greater than 78, `info` remains [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]], and `arr` remains an empty list.***
