The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `cases` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 (so it becomes 2), and `cases` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, `temp` is now a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`.**
