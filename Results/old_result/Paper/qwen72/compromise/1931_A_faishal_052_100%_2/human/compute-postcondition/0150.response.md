To determine what will be printed by the `print(temp)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the relevant parts of the code:

### Initial State:
- `cases` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `lex` is the last input integer processed.
- `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs.
- `temp` is a string containing the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `info`**:
   - `info` is a list of lists, where each inner list corresponds to one of the `cases` inputs.
   - Since `cases` is greater than 1, `info` has at least two inner lists.

2. **Accessing `info[1]`**:
   - `info[1]` refers to the second inner list in `info`.

3. **Calculating `temp`**:
   - `temp` is constructed by converting the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96` to their corresponding characters.
   - For example, if `info[1][0]` is 1, then `info[1][0] + 96` is 97, which corresponds to the character 'a'.
   - Similarly, if `info[1][1]` is 2, then `info[1][1] + 96` is 98, which corresponds to the character 'b'.
   - If `info[1][2]` is 3, then `info[1][2] + 96` is 99, which corresponds to the character 'c'.

4. **Constructing `temp`**:
   - `temp` will be the concatenation of the characters derived from the above calculations.
   - Therefore, if `info[1]` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then `temp` will be `'abc'`.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the construction of `temp`, the `print(temp)` statement will output the string formed by converting the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96` to their corresponding characters.

Output: **'abc' (where 'abc' is the string formed by converting the ASCII values of `info[1][0] + 96`, `info[1][1] + 96`, and `info[1][2] + 96` to their corresponding characters)**
