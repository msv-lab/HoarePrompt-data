The value of `lex` is decremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `lex` is `lex - 1`. If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1]`. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` >= 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1]`.**
