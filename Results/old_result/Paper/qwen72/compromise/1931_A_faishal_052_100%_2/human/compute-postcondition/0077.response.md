The code `arr.append(26)` appends the value 26 to the list `arr`. Let's analyze the impact of this code on the program:

- The initial state specifies that `arr` is set to different values based on the value of `lex`:
  - If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is set to `[1]`.
  - If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is set to `[26]`.
  - If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is set to `[26]`.
  - If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains an empty list.

- Regardless of the initial value of `arr`, the code `arr.append(26)` will add 26 to the end of the list `arr`.

Therefore, the output state will be:

- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` will be `[1, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` will be `[26, 26]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` will be `[26]`.

The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `info`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78, `info` is updated based on the initial value of `lex`, and `arr` is `[1, 26]` if `lex` is less than 28, `[26, 26]` if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive) or between 52 and 78 (inclusive), and `[26]` if `lex` is greater than 78.**
