Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `lex` < 52, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `arr` is updated based on the new value of `lex` as follows: If `lex` < 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex - 1]]` and `arr` is `[1, 1]`. If `lex` >= 28 and `lex` < 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 79], [lex + 25]]` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` >= 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` >= 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`. If `lex` >= 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition. If `lex` >= 52, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `info` and `arr` are updated as described. If `lex` <= 78, `lex` is reduced by 26, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values.***
