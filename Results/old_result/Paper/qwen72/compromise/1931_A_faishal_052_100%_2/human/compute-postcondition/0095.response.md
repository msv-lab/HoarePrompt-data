Output State: **`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `lex` is an input integer greater than or equal to 28 and less than 52, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 78], [lex]]`, `arr` is `[26]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the list `arr`.
- The initial state specifies that `arr` is an empty list `[]`.
- After executing the code, `arr` now contains the single element 26, making `arr` `[26]`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `lex`, and `info`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
