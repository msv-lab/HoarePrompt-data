Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `lex` is adjusted to be within the range [0, 26] if it was initially between 52 and 78, `info` remains the same, `arr` is [1, 26] if `lex` was less than 28, `arr` is [26, 26] if `lex` was between 28 and 78, and `arr` is [26] if `lex` was greater than 78, `lex` is now `lex - 26`.**

Explanation:
- `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`.
- All other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `info`, and `arr`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions for `arr` and `lex` adjustments based on the initial value of `lex` still hold true.
