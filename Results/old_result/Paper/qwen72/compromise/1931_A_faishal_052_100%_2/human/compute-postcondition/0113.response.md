Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `lex` is adjusted based on the initial value of `lex`. If the original `lex` was less than 28, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 27]]` and `arr` is `[1, 26]`. If the original `lex` was between 28 and 52 (inclusive), `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26 + 26]]` and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If the original `lex` was 52 or greater, `info` is `[[26, 26, 26, lex - 104], [lex - 26]]` and `arr` is `[26]`. If the original `lex` was greater than 78, `lex` remains unchanged, and `info` and `arr` retain their initial values as specified in the precondition.***
