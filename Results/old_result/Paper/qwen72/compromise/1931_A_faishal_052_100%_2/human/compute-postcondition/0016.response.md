Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is [26], `lex` is an input integer between 26 and 52 (inclusive), `j` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `lex` is reduced by 26, so if `lex` was initially between 52 and 78 (inclusive), it is now between 26 and 52 (inclusive). All other variables remain unchanged.
