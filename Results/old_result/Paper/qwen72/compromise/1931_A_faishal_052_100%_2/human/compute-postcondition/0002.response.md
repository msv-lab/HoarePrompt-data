To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0, as `i` will start from 0 and increment up to `cases - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `cases` is assigned the value of the integer input from the first line, which should be between 1 and 100.
- `info` is an empty list, but this is not relevant to the loop head.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must be at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
