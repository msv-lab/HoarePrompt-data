Postcondition: ***`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than 28, `lex` is `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[1, 1]`. If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `lex` is `lex - 1` and `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is greater than 51 and less than 52, `arr` is `[1]` if `lex` is greater than 78, otherwise `arr` is `[26, 1]`. If `lex` is 52 or greater, `arr` remains `[26]` and `lex` is unchanged. If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `lex` is reduced by 26 and `arr` is `[26, 26]`. If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` remains `[26]` and `lex` is unchanged.***
