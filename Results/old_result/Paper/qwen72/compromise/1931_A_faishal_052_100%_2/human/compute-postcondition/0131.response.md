To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, which is the default behavior of the `range` function.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that after all iterations of the loop:
- `cases` will have its original value (it is not modified within the loop),
- `i` will be equal to `cases` (indicating the loop has completed all iterations),
- `j` will be 2 (the last value it reaches in the inner loop),
- `lex` will be the last input integer processed (unchanged from its final modification),
- `info` will contain a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, structured based on the value of `lex`.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure these conditions are met.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` is the last input integer processed, `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs, structured as described.**
