The code snippet `info.append(arr)` appends the list `arr` to the list `info`. Since `info` was not previously defined in the initial state, we assume `info` starts as an empty list. After appending `arr`, `info` will contain one element, which is the list `arr`.

Given the conditions for `arr` based on the value of `lex`:
- If `lex` is less than 28, `arr` is `[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]`.
- If `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive), `arr` is `[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]`.
- If `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive), `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`.
- If `lex` is greater than 78, `arr` is `[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]`.

The values of `cases`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `lex` is an input integer, `info` is [[1, 1, 1, lex - 3]] if `lex` is less than 28; `info` is [[1, 1, lex - 27, 26]] if `lex` is between 28 and 51 (inclusive); `info` is [[26, 26, 26, lex - 78]] if `lex` is between 52 and 78 (inclusive) or greater than 78.**
