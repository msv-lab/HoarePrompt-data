To determine what will be printed by the `print(temp)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` must be greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `lex` is the last input integer processed.
   - `info` contains a list of lists, each corresponding to one of the `cases` inputs.
   - `temp` is the string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of `info[2][0] + 96`, `info[2][1] + 96`, and `info[2][2] + 96`.

2. **Understanding `info`:**
   - `info` is a list of lists, where each sublist corresponds to one of the `cases` inputs.
   - Since `cases` is greater than 2, `info` must have at least 3 sublists.
   - We are specifically interested in `info[2]`, which is the third sublist in `info`.

3. **Forming `temp`:**
   - `temp` is constructed by taking the elements of `info[2]` and converting them to characters by adding 96 to their values and then converting the result to a character using the ASCII table.
   - For example, if `info[2]` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then:
     - `info[2][0] + 96` is `1 + 96 = 97`, which corresponds to the character `'a'`.
     - `info[2][1] + 96` is `2 + 96 = 98`, which corresponds to the character `'b'`.
     - `info[2][2] + 96` is `3 + 96 = 99`, which corresponds to the character `'c'`.
   - Therefore, `temp` would be `'abc'`.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(temp)` statement will print the string `temp` formed as described above.

Given the initial state and the logic, the output will be:

Output: **temp (where temp is the string formed by concatenating the characters corresponding to the ASCII values of info[2][0] + 96, info[2][1] + 96, and info[2][2] + 96)**

For example, if `info[2]` is `[1, 2, 3]`, then the output will be:

Output: **abc**
