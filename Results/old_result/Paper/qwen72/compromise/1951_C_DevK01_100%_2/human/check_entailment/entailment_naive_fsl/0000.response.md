Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought, `k`, is greater than the number of days, `n`, multiplied by the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, `m`. In such cases, the program will not correctly calculate the minimum cost because it assumes that the number of days required to buy all tickets, `q`, is always less than or equal to the number of days available, `n`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 11
1 2 3 4 5
```
Here, `n = 5`, `m = 2`, and `k = 11`. The program will calculate `q` as `6` (since `math.ceil(11 / 2) = 6`), but there are only 5 days available. This will lead to an incorrect calculation of the cost.

The correct approach should ensure that the number of days required to buy all tickets does not exceed the number of days available. If `k` is greater than `n * m`, the program should handle this case appropriately.
