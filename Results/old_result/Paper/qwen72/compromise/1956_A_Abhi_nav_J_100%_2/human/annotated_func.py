#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k unique integers in strictly increasing order where 1 <= k <= 100 and 1 <= a[i] <= 100, b is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and 1 <= b[i] <= 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program attempts to return the result of `a - 1`, but since `a` is a list, this operation is not valid in Python. Therefore, the program will raise a TypeError.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list `b`, which is a list of q integers where 1 <= q <= 100 and 1 <= b[i] <= 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` unique integers in strictly increasing order (1 <= k <= 100, 1 <= a[i] <= 100), and `b` is a list of `q` integers (1 <= q <= 100, 1 <= b[i] <= 100). If the condition `a <= b` is true, the function attempts to return `a - 1`, which results in a `TypeError` because `a` is a list and cannot be subtracted by an integer. If the condition `a <= b` is false, the function returns the list `b`. In summary, the function either raises a `TypeError` or returns the list `b`.
