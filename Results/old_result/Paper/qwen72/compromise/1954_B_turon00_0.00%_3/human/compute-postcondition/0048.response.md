Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 1, `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is 1 or 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[i] == tmp` was initially true, then `cnt` was 1 and is now 2.
- If `a[i] == tmp` was initially false, then `cnt` was 0 and is now 1.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
