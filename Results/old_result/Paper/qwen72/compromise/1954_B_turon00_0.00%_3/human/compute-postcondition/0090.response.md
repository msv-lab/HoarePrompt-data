The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided function signature. However, considering the parameter constraints and relationships mentioned, it can be inferred that the function implicitly works with the parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` is between 1 and `n`. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 Â· 10^5.

Given the constraints, the function likely processes these inputs and returns a result based on the conditions provided. However, the specific output is not described in the problem statement. To accurately describe the functionality, we need to infer that the function processes the array `a` for each test case and returns some form of output based on the properties of the array.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It returns a result for each test case based on the properties of the list `a`.**
