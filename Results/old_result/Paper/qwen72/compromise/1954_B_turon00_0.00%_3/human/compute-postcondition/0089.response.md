Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is `t-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` across all iterations.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all `t` iterations, the variable `_` will be `t-1` (indicating the loop has completed its final iteration). The variables `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`, `cnt`, and `ans` will reflect their final values for the last iteration of the loop. Specifically, `n` will be the input integer for the last test case, `a` will be the list of integers for the last test case, `tmp` will be the first element of `a` for the last test case, `aa` will be a set of unique elements from `a` for the last test case, `i` will be `n-1` (indicating the loop has completed its final iteration over the list `a`), `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, and `ans` will be the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` across all iterations of the loop. If any list `a` contained only one unique element, the corresponding `ans` would be `-1` for that iteration.
