Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3, `ans` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. Since `cnt` was initially 2, it is now 3.
- The value of `ans` remains `n` because the code snippet does not change it.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
