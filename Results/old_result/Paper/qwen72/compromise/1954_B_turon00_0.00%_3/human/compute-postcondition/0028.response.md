Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`. If all elements in `a` are equal to `tmp`, then `cnt` is `n` and `ans` is `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list that are equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains an input integer within the specified range.
- The variable `_` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- The variable `n` is the length of the list `a`, which remains unchanged.
- The list `a` and the set `aa` containing unique elements from `a` remain unchanged.
- The variable `tmp` is still the first element of the list `a`.
- The loop index `i` will be `n-1` after the loop has completed all iterations.
- The variable `cnt` will be the count of consecutive elements at the end of the list `a` that are equal to `tmp`.
- The variable `ans` will be the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found during the loop execution. If all elements in `a` are equal to `tmp`, `ans` will be `n`. Otherwise, `ans` will be the smallest count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` encountered in the list.
