The code snippet `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial state indicates that `cnt` can be either 0 or 2, depending on the condition `a[i] == tmp`. We need to consider both cases:

1. If `a[i] == tmp`, then `cnt` is initially 2. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 3.
2. If `a[i] != tmp`, then `cnt` is initially 0. After executing `cnt += 1`, `cnt` becomes 1.

The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 3 and `ans` is equal to `n` if `a[0]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 2. If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and 1.**
