Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`. If `len(aa) == 1`, then `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**
