Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` at the end of the list `a`, and `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`. If `len(aa) == 1`, then `ans` is the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.
- The value of `ans` was initially the minimum value between `n` and the smallest count of consecutive occurrences of `tmp` found in the list `a`. If `len(aa) == 1`, then `ans` was the minimum value between `n` and `cnt`.
- After executing the code, `ans` is now the minimum value between its previous value and `cnt`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`, `cnt`) remain unchanged.
