Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, and `ans` is `n` and `cnt` is 1 if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`.
- The code `ans = min(ans, cnt)` updates `ans` to the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt`.
- If `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 1 and `ans` is `n`, so `ans` becomes `min(n, 1)`, which is 1.
- If `a[i]` is not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` is 0 and `ans` is 0, so `ans` remains 0.
- In both cases, the minimum value between `ans` and `cnt` is 0, so `ans` is 0 after the code execution.
