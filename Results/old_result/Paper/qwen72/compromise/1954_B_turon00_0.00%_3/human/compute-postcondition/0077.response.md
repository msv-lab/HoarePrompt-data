Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first element of the list `a`, `aa` is a set containing the unique elements from the list `a`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 2, `ans` is `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, `cnt` becomes 2 (it was initially 1).
- The value of `ans` remains `n` if `a[i]` is equal to `tmp`, otherwise it remains 0.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `i`) retain their initial values.
