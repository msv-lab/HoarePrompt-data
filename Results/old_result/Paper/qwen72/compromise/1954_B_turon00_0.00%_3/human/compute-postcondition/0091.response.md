Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it finds the minimum length of consecutive elements in the list `a` that are equal to the first element of the list. If all elements in the list are the same, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length of such consecutive elements. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. **
