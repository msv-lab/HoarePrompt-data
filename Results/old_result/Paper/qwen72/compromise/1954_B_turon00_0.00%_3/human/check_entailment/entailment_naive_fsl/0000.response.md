Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove in some scenarios where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The program should output `1` because removing the element at index 4 (0-based index) results in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful. However, the program will output `5` because it incorrectly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove.

The issue lies in the logic used to find the minimum number of elements to remove. The program initializes `ans` to `n` and then tries to find the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]`. This approach does not correctly handle the general case where the array can have different elements but still be beautiful. The program should instead check for the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property, which involves more complex logic to ensure that no valid operation can be performed.
