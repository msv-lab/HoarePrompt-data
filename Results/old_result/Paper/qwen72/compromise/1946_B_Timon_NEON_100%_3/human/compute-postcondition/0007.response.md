Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers and the start and end indices of that segment, and the last sublist in `segments_variants` is `[sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1, len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new sublist to `segments_variants` which is the concatenation of `new_segment` (an empty list) and `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- Since `new_segment` is empty, the new sublist appended to `segments_variants` is `[len(arr) - 1]`.
- The last sublist in `segments_variants` was originally `[sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1]`.
- After appending `[len(arr) - 1]` to `new_segment`, the last sublist in `segments_variants` becomes `[sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1, len(arr) - 1]`.
- The values of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
