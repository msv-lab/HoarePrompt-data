Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`], `segments_variants` is a list of lists where each sublist contains the sum of a segment of non-negative numbers and the start and end indices of that segment, and the last sublist in `segments_variants` is `[sum of all non-negative numbers in `arr`, index of the last non-negative number in `arr`, len(arr) - 1, len(arr) - 1]`, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is [-1].**

The code snippet initializes the variable `total_max_segment` to a list containing a single element, -1. The values of `new_segment`, `max_segment`, `segments_variants`, and `max_sum` remain unchanged.
