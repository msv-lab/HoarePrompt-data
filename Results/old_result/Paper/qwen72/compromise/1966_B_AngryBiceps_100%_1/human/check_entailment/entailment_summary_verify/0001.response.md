### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an \( n \times m \) grid of white ('W') and black ('B') squares.
   - We can perform operations to select any two squares of the same color and color all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the grid is already all one color, the answer is "YES".
   - If the grid has a checkerboard pattern (alternating colors in a consistent manner), it is impossible to make all squares the same color because any operation will only change the color of a subrectangle, not the entire grid.
   - If the first and last rows or the first and last columns are not the same color, it is impossible to make all squares the same color because the operation can only change the color of a subrectangle, and the first and last rows or columns would remain different.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid row by row and stores it in a list `a`.
   - It constructs two strings: `first_row` and `last_row` by concatenating the first and last characters of each row, respectively.
   - The program checks two conditions:
     - If the first row and the last row of the grid are both entirely one color but different from each other, it prints "NO".
     - If the first and last characters of all rows are the same but different from each other, it prints "NO".
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES".

4. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The first condition checks if the first row and the last row of the grid are both entirely one color but different from each other. This is a valid check because if the first row is all 'W' and the last row is all 'B', or vice versa, it is impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - The second condition checks if the first and last characters of all rows are the same but different from each other. This is also a valid check because if the first column is all 'W' and the last column is all 'B', or vice versa, it is impossible to make all squares the same color.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the grid is \( 1 \times 1 \) correctly by checking if the single row is all one color.
   - The program also handles the case where the grid is already all one color by checking if the first and last rows or columns are the same color.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not explicitly handle the case where the grid has a checkerboard pattern. However, the checkerboard pattern would be caught by the conditions because the first and last rows or columns would have different colors.
   - The program assumes that if the first and last rows or columns are not both entirely one color and different from each other, it is possible to make all squares the same color. This assumption is correct based on the problem constraints and the nature of the operations.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color based on the given conditions. The conditions are sufficient to cover all edge cases and the checkerboard pattern. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
