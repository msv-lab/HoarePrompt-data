Output State: **The loop processes each test case and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified. After all iterations, the variables `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `last_row` are reset for each new test case, and the loop continues to the next test case until all test cases are processed. The initial state of the function remains unchanged, and the function is ready to accept new test cases.**
