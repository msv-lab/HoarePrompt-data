Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- The loop has executed `t` times.
- `idx` is `1 + t * (n + 1)`.
- `results` is a list containing `t` strings, each string representing the calculated `ans` for each iteration.
- `n` is the last processed value of `n`.
- `v` is the last processed list of counts.
- `cnt` is the last processed sum of counts.
- `ans` is the last processed answer.

### Print Statement:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation:
- The `results` list contains `t` strings, where each string is the result of the `ans` calculation for each iteration of the loop.
- The `'\n'.join(results)` function joins all the strings in the `results` list into a single string, with each string separated by a newline character (`\n`).
- When the `print` statement is executed, it will print each string in the `results` list on a new line.

### Output:
The output will be a series of `t` lines, where each line contains the string representation of the `ans` calculated during each iteration of the loop.

Output: **[ans_1]
[ans_2]
...
[ans_t] (where [ans_1], [ans_2], ..., [ans_t] are the string representations of the `ans` values calculated in each of the `t` iterations)**
