The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `n` and the current value of `_`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 1, and `_` is 1. Since `_` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, `_` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + 2`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**
