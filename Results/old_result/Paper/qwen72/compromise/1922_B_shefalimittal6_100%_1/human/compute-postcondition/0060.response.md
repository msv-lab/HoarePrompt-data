Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `x` is reassigned to the integer value of `data[idx]`, where `idx` has been incremented by 1.
- `idx` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `v[x]` is incremented by 1, where `x` is now the integer value of `data[idx]`.
