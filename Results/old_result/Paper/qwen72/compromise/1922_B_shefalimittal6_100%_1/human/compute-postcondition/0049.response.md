Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is `n + 3`, `results` is a list containing a single string which is the string representation of `ans`, `n` is the integer value of `data[n + 2]`, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, where each element `v[i]` represents the count of occurrences of `i` in the first `n` elements of `data` starting from index 2, `cnt` is the sum of all elements in `v`, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- `idx` was initially `n + 2` and is incremented by 1, so `idx` is now `n + 3`.
- All other variables (`t`, `data`, `results`, `n`, `v`, `cnt`, `i`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
