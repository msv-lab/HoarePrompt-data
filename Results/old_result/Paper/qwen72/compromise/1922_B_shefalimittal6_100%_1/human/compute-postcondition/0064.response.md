Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `cnt` is 0, `i` remains `n`.**

The variable `cnt` is reset to 0. The other variables `n`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, and `i` retain their previous values or conditions. Specifically, `n` must still be greater than 0, `x` is still the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is still incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is still incremented by `n`, and `i` remains `n`.
