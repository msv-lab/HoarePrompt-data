Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `v[x]` is 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `n` is now `n - 1`, `x` is now the integer value of `data[3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `x = int(data[idx])` updates the value of `x` to the integer value of the element at index 3 of the list `data`.
- The initial value of `x` was the integer value of `data[2]`, but this is now replaced by the integer value of `data[3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
