Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `v[i] + v[i] + v[i]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is updated to `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is further updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is incremented by `v[i]`.
- The previous value of `cnt` was `v[i] + v[i]`.
- After the increment, `cnt` becomes `v[i] + v[i] + v[i]` or `3 * v[i]`.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
