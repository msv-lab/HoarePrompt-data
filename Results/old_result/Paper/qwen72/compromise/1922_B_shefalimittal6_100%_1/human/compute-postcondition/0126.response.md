Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i] + v[i]`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2. If `v[i]` is at least 3, `ans` is `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `v[i]` to it. Since `cnt` was previously `cnt + v[i] + v[i]`, after the code execution, `cnt` becomes `cnt + v[i] + v[i] + v[i]` or `cnt + 3 * v[i]`.
- The values of `_`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `v`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `ans` remains the same: if `v[i]` is at least 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.
