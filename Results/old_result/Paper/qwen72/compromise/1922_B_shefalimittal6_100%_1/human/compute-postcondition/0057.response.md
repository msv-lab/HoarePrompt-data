The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 1.**
