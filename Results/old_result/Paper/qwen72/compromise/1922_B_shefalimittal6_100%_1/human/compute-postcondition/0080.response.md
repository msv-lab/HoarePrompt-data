The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how these variables change and what conditions must be met for the loop to continue.

1. **Variable `i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. In a `for` loop, the loop variable (`i` in this case) is incremented by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 2.
2. **Variable `n`**: The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is now 2, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 1 (so that `n + 1` is at least 2).

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is `v[i] + v[i]`, `ans` is updated based on the value of `v[i]` as described.**
