Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is 1, `cnt` is `v[i]` more than its previous value (which was 0), `cnt` is now `v[i] + v[i]`. If `v[i]` is greater than or equal to 3, `ans` is updated to `ans + v[i] * (v[i] - 1) * (v[i] - 2) // 6`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- `cnt` is incremented by `v[i]`, and since `cnt` was initially `v[i]` more than its previous value (which was 0), `cnt` is now `v[i] + v[i]` or `2 * v[i]`.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.
