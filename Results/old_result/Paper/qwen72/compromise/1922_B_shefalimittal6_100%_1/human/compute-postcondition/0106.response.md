Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is 0.**

The code initializes `ans` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
