Output State: **`_` is `n - 1`, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is `idx + n`, `v[x]` is incremented by 1, `v` contains the counts of the values from `data` that were indexed from `idx` to `idx + n - 1`, `cnt` is `cnt + v[i] + v[i]`, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated by adding `cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2` to its current value.
- All other variables (`_`, `x`, `idx`, `v[x]`, `v`, `cnt`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `ans` based on `v[i]` being at least 3 is still valid, but the specific update in this code snippet is `ans += cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
- The value of `ans` is now `ans + cnt * v[i] * (v[i] - 1) // 2`.
