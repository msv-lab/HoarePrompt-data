The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, and its initial state is not relevant to the loop's execution. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `v` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`**
