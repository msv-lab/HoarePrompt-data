The code snippet `results.append(str(ans))` appends the string representation of `ans` to the list `results`. The values of `n`, `x`, `idx`, `v`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged. The list `results` now includes an additional element, which is the string representation of `ans`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by `n`, `v[x]` is incremented by `n`, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the sum of all values in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `ans` is the sum of all combinations of 2 and 3 from the values in `v` from index 0 to `n`, `results` includes an additional element, which is the string representation of `ans`.**
