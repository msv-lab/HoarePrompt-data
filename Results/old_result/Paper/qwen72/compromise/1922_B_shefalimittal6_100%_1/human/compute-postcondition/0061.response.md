Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `x` is the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, `idx` is incremented by 1, `v[x]` is incremented by 1**

Explanation:
- The value of `idx` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `x` remains the integer value of `data[idx - 1]`, as `idx` has just been incremented.
- The value of `v[x]` is still incremented by 1, as this operation has already taken place.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.
