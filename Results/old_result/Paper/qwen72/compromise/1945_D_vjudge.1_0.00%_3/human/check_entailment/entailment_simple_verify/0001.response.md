### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Reversal:**
   - The program reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k` for Kirill.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` and reverses them. This is a crucial step because it allows the program to process the people in the queue from the end to the beginning, which is necessary for Kirill to determine the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `m` people. The reversal is correct and necessary for the algorithm to work as intended.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `soma_b` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative cost of moving past people in the queue.
   - It also initializes `pref` to 0, which will store the minimum cost to move to a position within the first `m` people.
   - The program iterates over the first `n - k` people in the reversed queue (which corresponds to the last `n - k` people in the original queue). For each person:
     - If the cost to move to the person (`a[i]`) is less than the cost to move past the person (`b[i]`), Kirill will move to this position and pay `a[i]` plus the cumulative cost `soma_b`. The cumulative cost `soma_b` is reset to 0.
     - Otherwise, the cumulative cost `soma_b` is increased by `b[i]`.
   - This part of the logic is correct. It ensures that Kirill only moves to a position if it is cheaper than moving past it, and it resets the cumulative cost when a move is made.

3. **Final Position Calculation:**
   - After processing the first `n - k` people, the program calculates the minimum cost to move to any of the remaining positions (from `n - k` to `n`).
   - It does this by iterating over the remaining positions and updating the `resultado` with the minimum cost found.
   - The logic here is also sound. It correctly considers the cost to move to each of the remaining positions and updates the minimum cost accordingly.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum cost `resultado` for each test case.
   - This is correct and matches the problem's output requirements.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- **State Before `func_1` Call:**
  - `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \le k \le n \le 200,000\).
  - `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element \(a_i\) and \(b_i\) satisfies \(1 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9\).

- **State After Reversing Lists:**
  - `lista_A` and `lista_B` are reversed, so the last person in the original queue is now the first person in the reversed queue, and vice versa.

- **State After the First Loop:**
  - `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` before the last `k` elements, plus the sum of `soma_b` values accumulated during these iterations.
  - This state is correctly described and matches the program's logic.

- **State After the Second Loop:**
  - `soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, plus the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B`.
  - `pref` remains unchanged.
  - `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for all `i` in the range `n - k` to `n - 1`.
  - This state is also correctly described and matches the program's logic.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified and calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people. The annotations and the original assessment are consistent and accurate.
