Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the case where the input values for `n` and `m` are such that `n` is equal to `m`. According to the problem description, Kirill should be able to bribe people to get to any position from 1 to `m`, inclusive. However, the program incorrectly assumes that Kirill can only move to positions less than `m`, which is a problem when `n == m`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
2 2
2 3
1 1
```
In this case, Kirill is already in the last position (2), and he wants to be among the first 2 people, which he already is. Therefore, he should not need to spend any coins. However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost, leading to an incorrect output.
