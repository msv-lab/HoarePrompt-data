Output State: **`soma_b` is the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B` that are greater than or equal to the corresponding elements in `lista_A`, and `pref` is the sum of all elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` before the last `k` elements, plus the sum of `soma_b` values accumulated during these iterations.**
