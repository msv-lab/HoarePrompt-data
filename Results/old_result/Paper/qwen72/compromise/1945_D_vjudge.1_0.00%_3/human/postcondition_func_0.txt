The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`. It processes these lists to compute a result, which is the minimum value of the sum of a prefix sum of `lista_A` and a suffix sum of `lista_B` over the last `k` elements. Specifically, it calculates the sum of elements in `lista_A` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B` before the last `k` elements, and the sum of the last `k` elements of `lista_B`. The final result is the minimum value of this sum plus the corresponding element in `lista_A` for the last `k` elements. The function prints this result.
