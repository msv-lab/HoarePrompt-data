You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings s_list where each string s in s_list has a length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, and for each test case, it will read an integer a (which is not used in the loop body), a string s, count the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in s, and print the sum of these counts. After all iterations, the initial variables t and s_list will remain unchanged, and the loop will have printed the sum of counts for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `a` (which is not used), and a string `s`. It counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s` and prints the sum of these counts. The function does not return any value. After all test cases are processed, the initial variables `t` and `s_list` (if they exist) remain unchanged, and the function will have printed the sum of counts for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the problem of making the string beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. It simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" and sums them, which is incorrect. For example, consider the string "mmapnapie". The program will output 2 because it counts "map" once and "pie" once. However, the correct output should be 2, but the characters removed should be the 4th and 9th characters to remove the substrings "map" and "pie" respectively. The program does not account for the overlapping occurrences of these substrings or the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:
1. Identify all occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie".
2. Use a dynamic programming or greedy approach to determine the minimum number of deletions required to remove all occurrences of these substrings.
3. Output the minimum number of deletions.

The provided program does not implement this logic and thus is incorrect.
