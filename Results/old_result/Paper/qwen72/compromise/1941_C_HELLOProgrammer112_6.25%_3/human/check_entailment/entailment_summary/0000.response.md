Reasoning:

The provided program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself. It then counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string and prints the sum of these counts. However, the problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, which means the string should not contain "map" or "pie" as substrings.

The current program simply counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" and adds them together. This approach is incorrect because:

1. **Substring Removal**: The program does not account for the fact that removing a character can affect multiple substrings. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", removing the 'm' at index 1 will remove both "map" and "pie" substrings, but the program will count them separately and suggest removing 2 characters, which is not the minimum required.

2. **Overlap Consideration**: The program does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappppie", the substrings "map" and "pie" overlap. Removing the 'p' at index 3 will remove both substrings, but the program will count them as two separate substrings and suggest removing 2 characters.

3. **Correct Approach**: To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the minimum number of deletions required to ensure that neither "map" nor "pie" appears as a substring. This involves a more complex algorithm that considers the positions of these substrings and how they overlap.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
