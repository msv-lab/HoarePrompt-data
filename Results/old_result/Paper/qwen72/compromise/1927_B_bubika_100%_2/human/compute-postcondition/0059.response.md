The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of lists. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, with the constraint \(1 \le t \le 10^4\). Each inner list contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n`, where \(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \le a_i < n\). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). It is guaranteed that for each given trace, there exists a suitable string `s`.

The function returns a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a test case. Each string is the suitable string `s` that matches the trace provided in the corresponding test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of lists, where each inner list contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the trace of a string. It returns a list of strings, each corresponding to a test case, where the string matches the given trace.**
