Output State: **`b` is a list of 26 zeros, `t` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is a list of integers input by the user that must contain at least one integer between 0 and 25 (inclusive), `r` is an empty string, `i` is the first integer in `s`, `x` is the index of the first occurrence of `i` in `b` (which is always 0 because `b` is a list of 26 zeros and `i` is guaranteed to be in `s` and between 0 and 25).**
