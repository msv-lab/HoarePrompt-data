Output State: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each given trace, there exists a suitable string `s`. The variable `a` is now the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
