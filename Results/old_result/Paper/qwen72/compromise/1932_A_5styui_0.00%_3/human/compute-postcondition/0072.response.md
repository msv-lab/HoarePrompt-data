To determine what will be printed by the `print(s)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: An integer between 1 and 50.
2. **`a`**: An integer greater than 1.
3. **`i`**: An integer with a value of 1.
4. **`d`**: An input integer (the value of `d` is not specified, but it is an integer).
5. **`b`**: A new input string (the value of `b` is not specified, but it is a string).
6. **`j`**: The value of `j` is `len(b) - 1`, which means `j` is the index of the last character in the string `b`.
7. **`s`**: The number of '@' characters in `b` before the first occurrence of a newline character (`\n`).

Given the `print(s)` statement, we need to determine the value of `s`. The value of `s` is defined as the count of '@' characters in the string `b` before the first newline character (`\n`).

Since the exact value of `b` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of '@' characters in `b` before the first newline character.

Output: **s (where s is the number of '@' characters in the string `b` before the first occurrence of a newline character `\n`)**
