Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 0, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string that must have at least one character, `j` is 0, and the first character of `b` is '*' but the string `b` is empty.** 

However, since the precondition already states that `b` must have at least one character, the negation of the if condition (`if (b[:])`) implies that the string `b` is empty, which contradicts the precondition. Therefore, the correct interpretation is that the if condition is always true given the precondition, and the program will never enter the else block. 

To resolve this, we can assume the if condition is checking for a non-empty string, and since `b` must have at least one character, the postcondition should reflect that the if condition is false, meaning the string `b` is empty, which is not possible given the precondition. Thus, the postcondition should be:

Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 0, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string that must have at least one character, `j` is 0, and the string `b` is non-empty.** 

But since the else block is entered, the correct postcondition, considering the contradiction, is:

Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `s` is 0, `a` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string that must have at least one character, `j` is 0, and the first character of `b` is '*'.** 

Given the contradiction, the program should never enter the else block, but for the sake of the exercise, we assume the else block is entered, and the postcondition remains as stated.
