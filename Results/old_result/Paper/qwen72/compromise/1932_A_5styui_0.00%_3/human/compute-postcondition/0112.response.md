Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `a` from the user, representing the number of paths to process. For each path, it reads an integer `d` (which is not used in the function) and a string `b` of `d` characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The function counts the number of coins ('@') in the string `b` until it encounters a thorn ('*'). If a thorn is encountered, the counting stops, and the number of coins collected so far is printed. After processing each path, the coin count is reset to 0. The function does not return any value. **
