Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `j` is 1, and `s` is 0 or 1 depending on the first character of `b`. If the second character of `b` (i.e., `b[j + 1]`) is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution normally.***
