Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string with at least 3 characters, `j` is 2. If the character at index 2 in `b` is '@', `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0. If the character at index 2 in `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
