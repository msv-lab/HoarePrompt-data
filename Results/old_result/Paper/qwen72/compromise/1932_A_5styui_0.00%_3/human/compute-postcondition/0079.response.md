Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, `s` is 1, and the character at index `j` in `b` is '@'.** 

The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
