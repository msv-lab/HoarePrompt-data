Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 5, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1 + (g / count + 1)`, `countmins` is 4, `g` is `n / 5`. `count` must be less than or equal to `m`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `n / 5`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
