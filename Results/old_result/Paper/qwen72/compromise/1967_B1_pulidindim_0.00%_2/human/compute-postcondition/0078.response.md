Output State: **`n` and `m` are the new input integers, `t` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `count` is 3, `ans` is `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 2, and `g` is `n / 3`. `m` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

Explanation:
- The value of `g` is updated to `n / count`.
- Since `count` is 3, the new value of `g` is `n / 3`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
