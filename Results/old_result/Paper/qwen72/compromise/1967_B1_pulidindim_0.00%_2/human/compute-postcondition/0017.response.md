Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is equal to `n / 4`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is in, but it does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
