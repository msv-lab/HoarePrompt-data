Output State: **`n` and `m` are the input integers, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `count` is 2, `ans` is `n`, `countmins` is `m`, `g` is `n / m - (m - 1)`. If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is updated to be equal to `n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `t`, `i`, `count`, `countmins`, and `g` remain unchanged. The condition for breaking the loop (`g` is less than `countmins`) is still valid.
