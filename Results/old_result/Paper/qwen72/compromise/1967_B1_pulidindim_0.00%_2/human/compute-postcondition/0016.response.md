Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `count` is 4, `ans` is equal to `n + (n / 2 - 1) / 2 + 1`, `countmins` is 3, `g` is equal to `n / 4`. If `n / 4` is less than `countmins`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
