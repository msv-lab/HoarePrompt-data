The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `a`, `b`, `k`, `n`, and `m`. `a` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers, `k` is an integer, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `m` is the length of the list `b`. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer within the range [1, 10^6]. The function returns the number of "good subarrays" of length `m` in `a`, where a "good subarray" is defined as a subarray where the sum of the minimum frequencies of each integer in the subarray and the corresponding integer in `b` is greater than or equal to `k`.
