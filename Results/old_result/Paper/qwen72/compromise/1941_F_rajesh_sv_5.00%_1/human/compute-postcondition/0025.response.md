Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `max_diff` is `A[3] - A[2]`, `index` is set to 3, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf.**

The variable `index` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 3. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
