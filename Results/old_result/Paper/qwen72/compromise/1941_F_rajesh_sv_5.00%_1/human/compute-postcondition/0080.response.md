Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and `l` is now less than `h` or `l` is now `mid + 1`. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. `f` is now the next element in `F`. `l` is now the index of the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f` if the `else` part executed, or `l` is `mid + 1` if the `if` part executed. `h` is now the value of `mid`. If `l` and `h` are not equal, `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and the value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. `mid` is now the value of `l + (h - l) // 2`. `mid_sum` is now `D[mid] + f`, and `mid_next_sum` is now `D[mid + 1] + f`. `h` must be greater than `l` for the loop to execute one more time.**
