The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 at the start of each iteration, `i` will be 3 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()`, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, `index` is set to 2, and `next_max_diff` remains -inf. Otherwise, `max_diff` remains -inf, `index` is None, and if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` <= `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains unchanged.**
