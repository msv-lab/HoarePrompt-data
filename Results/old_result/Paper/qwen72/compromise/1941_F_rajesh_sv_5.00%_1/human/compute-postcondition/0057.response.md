Output State: **The loop has finished executing, and the final values of `l` and `h` are equal. The variables `A`, `n`, `i`, `m`, `k`, `D`, `F`, `f`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `left`, `right`, and `ans` remain unchanged except `ans`. `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and the value of `max(D[l] + f - left, right - D[l] - f)`.**
