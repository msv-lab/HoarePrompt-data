Output State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the largest element less than or equal to the midpoint between `left - f` and `right - f`, `h` is equal to `l`, `mid` is `l`, `mid_sum` is `D[l] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + 1] + f` if `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, otherwise `mid_next_sum` is undefined. `ans` remains unchanged unless `l` is equal to `h` in the final iteration, in which case `ans` is updated to the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`l` and `h`**: After the loop finishes, `l` and `h` will converge to the same index in `D`. This index corresponds to the largest element in `D` that is less than or equal to the midpoint between `left - f` and `right - f`.
- **`mid`**: The variable `mid` will be equal to `l` (and `h`) at the end of the loop, as the loop continues to update `mid` until `l` and `h` are the same.
- **`mid_sum`**: This is the value of `D[l] + f`, where `l` is the final index where `l` and `h` converge.
- **`mid_next_sum`**: If `l + 1` is within the bounds of `D`, then `mid_next_sum` is `D[l + 1] + f`. Otherwise, `mid_next_sum` is undefined because `l + 1` would be out of bounds.
- **`ans`**: The variable `ans` will only be updated if `l` is equal to `h` in the final iteration of the loop. In this case, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its original value and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f`. If `l` and `h` do not converge to the same index in the final iteration, `ans` remains unchanged.
