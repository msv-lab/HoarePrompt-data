The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is now a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is `A[1] - A[0]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[1] - A[0]`, `index` is set to 1, and `next_max_diff` remains -infinity. Otherwise, if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is set to `A[1] - A[0]`, and `index` remains None. If `diff` is not greater than `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains -infinity, and `index` remains None.**
