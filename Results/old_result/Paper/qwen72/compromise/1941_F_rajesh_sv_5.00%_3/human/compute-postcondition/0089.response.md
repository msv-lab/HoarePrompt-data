To ensure the `while` loop can execute the first time, we need to focus on the conditions in the loop head, which are `l` and `h`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than `h`.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`.
- `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `h`. Since `l` is determined by the first element in `D` that is greater than `left - f`, and `h` is determined by the index where `D` is greater than or equal to `right - f` minus 1, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h`.

### Analysis:
- `l` is the index where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`.
- `h` is the index where `D[h + 1]` is the first element greater than or equal to `right - f`.

For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than `h`. This means that there must be at least one element in `D` between `D[l]` and `D[h + 1]` (exclusive).

### Adjustments:
- If `l` is equal to `h`, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `l` is less than `h`.
- If `l` is already less than `h`, no adjustment is needed.

### Conclusion:
The state right before the loop is:
- `l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`.
- `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `l < h`.

State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, and `l` must be less than `h`**.
