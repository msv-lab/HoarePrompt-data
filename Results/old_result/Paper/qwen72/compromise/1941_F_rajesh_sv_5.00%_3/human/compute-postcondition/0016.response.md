Output State: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1]`, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is now a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `diff` is `A[2] - A[1]`. If `diff` > `max_diff`, then `max_diff` is updated to `A[2] - A[1]`, `index` is set to 2, and `next_max_diff` remains -infinity. Otherwise, if `diff` > `next_max_diff`, then `next_max_diff` is set to `A[2] - A[1]`, and `index` remains None. If `diff` is not greater than `next_max_diff`, `next_max_diff` remains -infinity, and `index` remains None.**
