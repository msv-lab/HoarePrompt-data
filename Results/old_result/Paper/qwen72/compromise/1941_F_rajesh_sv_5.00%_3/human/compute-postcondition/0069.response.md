Postcondition: **`A` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= `A[i]` <= 2 * 10^9 and `A[i]` < `A[i+1`. `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is `n-1`, `m` and `k` are assigned the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique integers representing the complexities of the models, where 1 <= `D[i]` <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers representing the complexities of the functions, where 1 <= `F[i]` <= 10^9, as returned by `func_4()`, `k` must be greater than 0, `f` is the second element in `F` and must be such that `left - f` is less than `right - f`, `max_diff` is the largest difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second largest difference between consecutive elements in `A` (if it exists), `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the largest difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is the minimum of the original `ans` and the maximum of `D[l] + f - left` and `right - D[l] - f` if `l` is equal to `h`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged, `D` must have at least two elements, `l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, `h` is the index in `D` where `D[h]` is the largest element less than or equal to `right - f`, `mid` is `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is `D[mid + 1] + f`. If `mid_sum - left` is less than `right - mid_next_sum`, then `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, `h` is updated to `mid`.**
