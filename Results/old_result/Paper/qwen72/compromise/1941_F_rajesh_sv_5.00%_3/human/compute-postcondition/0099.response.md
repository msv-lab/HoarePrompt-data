Output State: **`l` is the index in `D` where `D[l]` is the first element greater than `left - f`, `h` is equal to `bisect_left(D, right - f) - 1`, `l` must be less than `h`, `mid` is equal to `l + (h - l) // 2`, `mid_sum` is equal to `D[mid] + f`, `mid_next_sum` is equal to `D[mid + 1] + f`.**

The code snippet updates the values of `mid_sum` and `mid_next_sum` to `D[mid] + f` and `D[mid + 1] + f` respectively, but the initial conditions and other variable values remain unchanged.
