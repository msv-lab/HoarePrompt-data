Let's analyze the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is `len(s) - 1`, which means `i` is the last index of the list `s`.
   - `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index.
   - `ptsb` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is calculated as `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`.
   - `ptss` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is calculated as `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]`.
   - `rem` is `k - len(s)`, which is the remaining value after subtracting the length of `s` from `k`.
   - `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
   - `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
   - `maxs` is equal to `maxb` or `maxs` is greater than `maxb`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('Draw')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Draw'`.
   - The initial state provides conditions and values for various variables, but the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables directly. It only prints the string `'Draw'`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The output of the `print` statement will be the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
