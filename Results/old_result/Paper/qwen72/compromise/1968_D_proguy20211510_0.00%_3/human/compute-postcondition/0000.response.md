The code snippet assigns the string 'YES' to the variable `YES` and the string 'NO' to the variable `NO`. These assignments do not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, representing the length of the permutation, the duration of the game, and the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively. p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, representing the permutation p. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the array a. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'.**
