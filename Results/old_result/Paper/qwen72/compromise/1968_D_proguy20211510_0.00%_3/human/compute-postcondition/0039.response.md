Output State: **`foundb` is False, `founds` is True, `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is now the value of `p[pb - 1]`, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` now contains the element `a[pb - 1]` in addition to the existing element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` contains the element `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**

Explanation:
- `pb` is updated to the value of `p[pb - 1]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
