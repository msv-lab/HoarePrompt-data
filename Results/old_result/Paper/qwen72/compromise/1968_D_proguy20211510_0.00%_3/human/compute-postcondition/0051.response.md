Postcondition: **`foundb` is True or False, `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `s` contains one element, and `b` contains two elements. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `s` contains `maxa`, `founds` is True, and if `foundb` is True, `b` contains `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`. If `foundb` is False, `s` contains `maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`, and `b` contains `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` (where `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`). If `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, and if `foundb` is True, `b` contains `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `maxa`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` is False, `s` contains `a[ps - 1]`, `b` contains `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]` (where `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`), and `founds` is False.**
