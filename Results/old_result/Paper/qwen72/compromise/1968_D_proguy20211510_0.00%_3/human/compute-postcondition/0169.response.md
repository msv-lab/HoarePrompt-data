Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`, and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`.** 

The code snippet `s.append(maxa)` appends the value of `maxa` to the list `s`. The other variables `i`, `k`, `foundb`, and `founds` remain unchanged. The value of `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]` as specified in the initial state.
