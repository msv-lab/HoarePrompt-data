Let's break down the initial state and the provided Python code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `len(s) - 1`: This means `i` is the last index of the list `s`.
2. `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index.
3. `ptsb` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is `preb[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * b[i]`.
4. `ptss` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is `pres[i] + (k - (i + 1)) * s[i]`.
5. `rem` is `k - len(s)`: This is the remaining value after subtracting the length of `s` from `k`.
6. `maxs` is the maximum value in `ptss`.
7. `maxb` is the maximum value in `ptsb`.
8. `maxs` is less than `maxb`: This condition indicates that the maximum value in `ptss` is less than the maximum value in `ptsb`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'Bodya'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about the variables and lists, but none of these variables or lists are used in the `print` statement.
- The condition `maxs < maxb` is given, but it does not affect the `print` statement in any way.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
