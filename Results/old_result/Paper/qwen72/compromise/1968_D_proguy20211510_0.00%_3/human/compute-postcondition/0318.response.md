Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` is either True or False, `founds` is True, `b` has a new element appended if `foundb` is True or if `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, `s` has a new element appended if `foundb` is True and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited if `foundb` is True or if `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] == maxa`. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true after this update, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.**
