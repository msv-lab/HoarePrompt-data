Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, and `foundb` is false. If `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` is true, and `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, which is equal to `(k - 1) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
