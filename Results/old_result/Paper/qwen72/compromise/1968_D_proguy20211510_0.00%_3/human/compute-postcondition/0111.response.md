The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `pres`, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `pres`. If `pres` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. The initial state of `i` is `len(s) - 1`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `0` for the loop to start correctly.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be `0` (to start the loop correctly).
- `pres` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list that now contains `len(s)` elements, where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `s` up to that index**
