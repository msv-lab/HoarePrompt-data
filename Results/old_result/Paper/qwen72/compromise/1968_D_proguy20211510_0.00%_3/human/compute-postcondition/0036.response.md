The code snippet `b.append(a[pb - 1])` appends the value at index `pb - 1` of the list `a` to the list `b`.

Given the initial state:
- `foundb` is True
- `founds` is True
- `_` remains 0
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is greater than 0
- `pb` is an integer
- `ps` is an integer
- `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input
- `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `b` and `s` each contain one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`
- The element at index `pb - 1` in the list `a` is equal to `maxa`

The impact of the code:
- The value at index `pb - 1` in the list `a` is `maxa`.
- This value is appended to the list `b`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `b` now contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, and the second element is `maxa`.

Output State: **`foundb` is True, `founds` is True, `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` contains two elements: the first element is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and the second element is `maxa`, `s` contains one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`.**
