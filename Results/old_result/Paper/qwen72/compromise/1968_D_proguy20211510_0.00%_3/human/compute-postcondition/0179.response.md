The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is -1 and `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false**
