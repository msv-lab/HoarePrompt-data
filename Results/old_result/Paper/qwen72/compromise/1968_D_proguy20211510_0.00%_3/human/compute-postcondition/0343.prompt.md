Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` will be `len(pres) - 1`, `pres` will still be a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index, `rem` will be `k - len(pres)`, `ptsb` will be a list containing the values `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, ..., `preb[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * b[len(pres) - 1]`, `ptss` will be a list containing the values `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`, `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`, ..., `pres[len(pres) - 1] + (k - len(pres)) * s[len(pres) - 1]`, `maxs` will be the maximum value in `ptss`, `maxb` will be the maximum value in `ptsb`, if `maxs` > `maxb`, then `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, otherwise `maxs` is less than or equal to `maxb`, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are now integers representing the input values, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `maxa` is the maximum value in `a`, `b` and `s` are now empty lists, `founds` is `False`, `foundb` is `False`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k):
    if foundb and founds:
        b.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        s.append((k - (i + 1)) * maxa)
        break
    if foundb:
        b.append(maxa)
    elif a[pb - 1] == maxa:
        foundb = True
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
    else:
        b.append(a[pb - 1])
        pb = p[pb - 1]
    if founds:
        s.append(maxa)
    elif a[ps - 1] == maxa:
        founds = True
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
    else:
        s.append(a[ps - 1])
        ps = p[ps - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. If `founds` is true, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`, and `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `founds` is false, and `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` and `founds` are true, and `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`. Additionally, if `foundb` is false and `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `foundb` becomes true, and `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`. If `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If both `foundb` and `founds` are true, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, which is equal to `(k - 1) * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` and `founds` can be either True or False. If `founds` is True, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`, and `a` is unchanged. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True, and `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, which is equal to `a[ps - 1]` (or `(k - 2) * maxa` if `foundb` is also True), and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and `foundb` and `founds` remain unchanged. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true after any updates, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, and `s` has a new element appended. If `founds` is True, the new element in `s` is equal to `maxa`. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True, and if `foundb` is also True, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] == maxa` but `foundb` is False, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`, and `a` is unchanged. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and `foundb` and `founds` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
