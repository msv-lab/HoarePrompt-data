Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is false, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, if `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `k * maxa`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`, and `a[pb - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.**
