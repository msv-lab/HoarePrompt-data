The provided code snippet is:
```
print('Draw')
```

This is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'Draw'`. The initial state provides a lot of context about various variables and lists, but none of these variables or lists are actually used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'Draw'`.

Output: **Draw**
