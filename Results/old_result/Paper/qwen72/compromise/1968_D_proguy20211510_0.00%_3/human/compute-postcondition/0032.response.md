Output State: **If `foundb` and `founds` are both True, `_` remains 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` now contains one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa` and another element which is `maxa`, `foundb` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `foundb` or `founds` is False, the variables and lists retain their initial values and states.**
