Postcondition: ***`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is false, `pb` is now equal to `p[pb - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1]` is equal to `maxa`, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`, and `founds` is true. Otherwise, `b` has a new element appended based on the conditions provided, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and `ps` is now equal to `p[ps - 1]`.***
