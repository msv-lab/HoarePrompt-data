Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than 0, `pb` is an integer, `ps` is an integer, `p` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user input, `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `b` is a list containing one element which is `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`, `s` is an empty list, `founds` is True, `foundb` is True.**

The code snippet appends a new element to the list `b`, which is calculated as `(k - (i + 1)) * maxa`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so it is assumed to be a variable that has been previously defined. The other variables remain unchanged.
