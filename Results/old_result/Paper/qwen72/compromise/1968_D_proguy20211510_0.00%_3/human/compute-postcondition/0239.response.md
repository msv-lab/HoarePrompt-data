Output State: **`i` is 0, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least one element, `rem` is `k - 1`, `ptsb` is a list that now contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`.** 

The code appends the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]` to the list `ptsb`. The values of `i`, `pres`, and `rem` remain unchanged.
