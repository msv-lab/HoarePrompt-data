Output State: **`i` is `len(s) - 1`, `b` and `s` each have `len(s)` elements, `preb` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `b` up to that index, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `sb` is the sum of all elements in `b`, `ss` is the sum of all elements in `s`, `ptsb` is an empty list, `ptss` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes two new lists, `ptsb` and `ptss`, to be empty. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
