Output State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least two elements, `rem` is `k - 2`, `ptsb` is a list that now contains the values `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]` and `preb[1] + (k - 2) * b[1]`, `ptss` is a list that now contains the values `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]` and `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]`.** 

The code snippet `ptss.append(pres[i] + rem * s[i])` adds a new element to the list `ptss`. This new element is calculated as `pres[1] + (k - 2) * s[1]` because `i` is 1 and `rem` is `k - 2`. The other variables and their values remain unchanged.
