Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string, `k` is a string, `pb` is a string, `ps` is a string**

Explanation: The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` are assigned the values from the input split by spaces. The input is provided as a single line of four space-separated values, and these values are assigned to `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` respectively. The variables `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
