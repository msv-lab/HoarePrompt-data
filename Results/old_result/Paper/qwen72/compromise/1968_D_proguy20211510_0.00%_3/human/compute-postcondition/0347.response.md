The code `preb.append(sb + b[i])` appends the value of `sb + b[i]` to the list `preb`. Here, `i` is `k - 1`, and `b` is a list with `k` elements. Since `sb` is 0, the value appended to `preb` is `b[k - 1]`. The other variables (`s`, `pres`, `ss`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `k - 1`, `b` and `s` each have `k` elements where `k` is greater than 0, `preb` is a list with one element `b[k - 1]`, `pres` is an empty list, `sb` and `ss` are 0.**
