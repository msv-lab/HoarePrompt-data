Output State: **`i` is 1, `pres` is a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least two elements, `rem` is `k - 2`, `ptsb` is a list that now contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`, `ptss` is a list that now contains the value `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`**

Explanation:
- `i` remains 1.
- `pres` remains a list containing the cumulative sums of `s` up to each index and must have at least two elements.
- `rem` is updated to `k - (i + 1)`, which simplifies to `k - 2` since `i` is 1.
- `ptsb` remains a list that now contains the value `preb[0] + (k - 1) * b[0]`.
- `ptss` remains a list that now contains the value `pres[0] + (k - 1) * s[0]`.
