Output State: **`i` is 2, `pres` is a list with `len(s)` elements where each element is the cumulative sum of elements in `s` up to that index, `ptsb` is a list with three elements where the first element is `preb[0] + rem * b[0]`, the second element is `preb[1] + rem * b[1]`, and the third element is `preb[2] + rem * b[2]`, `ptss` is a list with two elements where the first element is `pres[0] + rem * s[0]` and the second element is `pres[1] + rem * s[1]`, `rem` is `k - 3`**

Explanation:
- The code `ptsb.append(preb[i] + rem * b[i])` appends a new element to the list `ptsb`.
- The new element is `preb[2] + rem * b[2]`, since `i` is 2.
- The values of `i`, `pres`, `ptss`, and `rem` remain unchanged.
- The list `ptsb` now has three elements: the first two elements are the same as before, and the third element is `preb[2] + rem * b[2]`.
