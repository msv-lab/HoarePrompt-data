Output State: **`i` is -1, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is true, if `founds` is true, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `k * maxa`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`.** 

The value of `i` remains -1, `k` is still greater than 0, `foundb` is still true, and the condition for `founds` remains unchanged. If `founds` is true, `s` still has a new element appended which is equal to `k * maxa`. The most internal loop or if statement is still exited. The list `b` now has a new element appended, which is equal to `maxa`.
