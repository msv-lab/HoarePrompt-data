Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1, `foundb` and `founds` can be either True or False. If `founds` is True, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`, and `a` is unchanged. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is set to True, and `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, which is equal to `a[ps - 1]` (or `(k - 2) * maxa` if `foundb` is also True), and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `founds` is False and `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[ps - 1]`, and `foundb` and `founds` remain unchanged. If `foundb` is False and `a[pb - 1] != maxa`, `pb` is updated to `p[pb - 1]`. If `foundb` and `founds` are both true after any updates, `b` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[pb - 1]`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
