The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('Bodya')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state describes several variables and their relationships:
  - `_` is 0.
  - `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
  - `n` is an integer.
  - `k` is an integer.
  - `pb` is an integer.
  - `ps` is an integer.
  - `p` is a list of integers provided by user input.
  - `a` is a list of integers provided by user input.
  - `maxa` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
  - `a[pb - 1]` is equal to `maxa`.
  - `a[ps - 1]` is not equal to `maxa`.

- However, the `print` statement in the code snippet does not reference any of these variables or their values. It simply prints the string `'Bodya'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'Bodya'`.

Output: **Bodya**
