Output State: **`i` is `k-1`, `k` is an integer, `foundb` is either true or false, `founds` is either true or false, `preb` is a list containing the value `sb + b[i]`, `pres` is a list containing the value `ss + s[i]`, `sb` is `b[i]`, `ss` is `s[i]`.**

Explanation: The code `ss += s[i]` updates the value of `ss` by adding the value of `s[i]` to it. Initially, `ss` is 0, so after the execution, `ss` will be equal to `s[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
