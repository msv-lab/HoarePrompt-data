Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2, and `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `a[ps - 1]`. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa`, `founds` is True, and if `foundb` is also True, `b` and `s` each have a new element appended, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a[ps - 1] == maxa` and `foundb` is False, `s` has a new element appended which is equal to `maxa`, and `a` is unchanged. If `a[ps - 1] != maxa`, `ps` is updated to `p[ps - 1]`, and `foundb` and `founds` remain unchanged.**
