Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0, `foundb` is true, `founds` is either true or false. If `founds` is true, `b` is a list that includes the value `(k - 1) * maxa` and `a[pb - 1]`, `s` is a list that includes the value `(k - 1) * maxa`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `b` is a list that includes the value `a[pb - 1]` and the state of the program remains unchanged.**
