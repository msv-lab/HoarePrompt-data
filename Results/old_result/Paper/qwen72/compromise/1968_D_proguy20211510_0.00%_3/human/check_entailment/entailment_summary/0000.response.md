Reasoning:

The program aims to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" between Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the arrays `p` and `a`. Here's a detailed analysis of the program's logic and behavior:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Maximum Value**:
   - The program finds the maximum value in the array `a` using `maxa = max(a)`.
   - It checks if both Bodya and Sasha start at the position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints 'Draw' and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya starts at the position with the maximum value, it prints 'Bodya' and continues.
   - If only Sasha starts at the position with the maximum value, it prints 'Sasha' and continues.

3. **Game Simulation**:
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes two boolean flags `foundb` and `founds` to track if Bodya or Sasha has found the maximum value in `a` during their moves.
   - For each turn up to `k`:
     - If both players have found the maximum value, it appends the remaining turns' scores as `maxa` for both.
     - If only Bodya has found the maximum value, it appends `maxa` to Bodya's score list.
     - If only Sasha has found the maximum value, it appends `maxa` to Sasha's score list.
     - Otherwise, it appends the current position's value from `a` to the respective score list and updates the position based on the permutation `p`.

4. **Cumulative Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `b` and `s`.
   - It then calculates the potential scores if the players continue to stay at the position with the maximum value for the remaining turns.

5. **Determine the Winner**:
   - The program compares the maximum potential scores of Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints 'Sasha' if Sasha's maximum potential score is greater.
   - It prints 'Bodya' if Bodya's maximum potential score is greater.
   - It prints 'Draw' if both have the same maximum potential score.

### Issues and Correctness:
- **Initial Check for Maximum Value**:
  - The initial check for the maximum value in `a` is correct and handles the cases where one or both players start at the position with the maximum value.
  
- **Game Simulation**:
  - The game simulation logic is correct in terms of updating the scores and positions based on the rules.
  - However, the logic for appending the remaining turns' scores as `maxa` when both players have found the maximum value is incorrect. This should not be a simple multiplication by `maxa` but rather a continuation of the game simulation to ensure the correct cumulative score.

- **Cumulative Score Calculation**:
  - The cumulative score calculation is correct, but the potential score calculation for remaining turns is flawed. The program should continue to simulate the game for the full `k` turns or until a cycle is detected.

- **Determine the Winner**:
  - The comparison of the maximum potential scores is correct, but it relies on the flawed potential score calculation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the potential score calculation and the premature appending of scores, the program is not fully correct. The logic for handling the remaining turns when both players have found the maximum value needs to be revised to accurately simulate the game for the full `k` turns.

Correctness: **False**
