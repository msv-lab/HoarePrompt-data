Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the maximum number of pages is in the last two books. For example, consider the input:

```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

The correct output should be `7` because the best way to divide the books is to put the first three books in one pile and the last book in another pile. This way, Alice reads the books with 3 and 4 pages, totaling 7 pages. However, the program will output `5` because it always adds the last book to the sum and the maximum of the rest of the books, which in this case is `1 + 4 = 5`.

The program should consider the maximum two values in the list, regardless of their positions, to ensure the correct output for all cases.
