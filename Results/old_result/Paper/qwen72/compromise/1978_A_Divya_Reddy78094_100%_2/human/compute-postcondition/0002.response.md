Output State: **The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read an integer `n` and a list of integers `nums` from the input. It then printed the sum of the maximum value in the list `nums` (excluding the last element) and the last element of the list `nums`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are not retained between iterations, so they will be reset for each new test case. The initial list `a` and the integer `n` from the initial state are not modified by the loop.**
