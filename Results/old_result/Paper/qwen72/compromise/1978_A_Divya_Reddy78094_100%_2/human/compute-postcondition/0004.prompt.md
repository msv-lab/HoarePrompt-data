You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the number of pages in each book, and an integer `n` representing the number of books, such that 2 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all 1 <= i <= n. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, with the number of test cases `t` being an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read an integer `n` and a list of integers `nums` from the input. It then printed the sum of the maximum value in the list `nums` (excluding the last element) and the last element of the list `nums`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are not retained between iterations, so they will be reset for each new test case. The initial list `a` and the integer `n` from the initial state are not modified by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`, where `a` represents the number of pages in each book and `n` is the number of books (2 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a_i <= 10^9). It returns the total number of pages across all books in the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
