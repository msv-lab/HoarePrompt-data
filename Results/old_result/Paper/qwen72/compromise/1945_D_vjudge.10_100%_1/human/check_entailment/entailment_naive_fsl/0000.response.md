Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is called but the function itself does not handle the logic for determining the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to move to a position within the first `m` people in the queue.

The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people, but the current implementation does not correctly account for the costs of moving to different positions. The function simply iterates from the end of the queue and accumulates the minimum of `a[i]` and `b[i]` into `x`, and updates `pergunta` with the minimum cost to move to a position `i` if `i < m`. However, this does not consider the actual cost of moving Kirill to a specific position `j` and the subsequent costs for each position `k` between `j` and `i`.

Here is a potential case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  14
  ```
- Actual Output:
  The program will output a different value because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.

The correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to consider the costs of moving Kirill to different positions and the subsequent costs for each position between the current and the target position. The current implementation does not achieve this.
