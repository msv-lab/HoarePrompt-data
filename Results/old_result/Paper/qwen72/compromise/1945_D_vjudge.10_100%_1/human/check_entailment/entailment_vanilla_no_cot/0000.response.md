Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the costs associated with bribing people in the queue.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`**:
   - The variable `x` is supposed to accumulate the total cost Kirill incurs by bribing people. However, the line `x += min(a[i], b[i])` is incorrect. Kirill should only pay `b[i]` to people he bribes to move past, and `a[i]` to the person he directly swaps with.

2. **Incorrect Condition for `pergunta`**:
   - The condition `if i < m:` is used to update `pergunta` with the minimum cost. This condition should be `if i + 1 <= m:` because the positions in the queue are 1-indexed, not 0-indexed.

3. **Incorrect Use of `min`**:
   - The use of `min(a[i], b[i])` in the loop is incorrect. Kirill should only add `b[i]` to `x` when he moves past a person, and `a[i]` when he swaps with a person.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
numCasos = int(input())
for i in range(numCasos):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    pergunta = float('inf')
    func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m)

def func_1(pergunta, a, b, n, m):
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if i + 1 <= m:
            pergunta = min(pergunta, x + a[i])
        x += b[i]
    print(pergunta)
```

### Explanation:
- **`x` Accumulates Bribing Costs**: `x` is used to accumulate the total cost of bribing people as Kirill moves from the end of the queue to the front.
- **Correct Condition for `pergunta`**: The condition `if i + 1 <= m:` ensures that Kirill only considers positions up to `m` (1-indexed).
- **Correct Bribing Cost**: `x += b[i]` correctly adds the cost of bribing the person at position `i` to move past them.

This corrected program should now correctly compute the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to be among the first `m` people in the queue.
