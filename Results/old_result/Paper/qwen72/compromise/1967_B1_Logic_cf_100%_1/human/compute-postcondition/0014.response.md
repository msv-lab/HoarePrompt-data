The provided Python code snippet reads two values from the input, splits them, and assigns them to `n` and `m`. This operation changes the values of `n` and `m` from their initial state (which were integers derived from the input string) to new values read from the input.

Let's assume the input provided is "4 6". After executing the code:

- `n` is now "4" (a string).
- `m` is now "6" (a string).

The other variables (`b`, `t`, `T`, and `ans`) remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code snippet provided.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`n` is "4", `m` is "6", `b` is `min(n, m) + 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 1, `ans` is `n + sum((n + b) // (b * b) for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1))`.**
