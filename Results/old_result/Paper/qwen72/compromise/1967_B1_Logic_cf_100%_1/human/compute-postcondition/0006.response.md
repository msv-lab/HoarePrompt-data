The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` to its current value. Given that `b` is 2, the expression simplifies to `(n + 2) // 4`. Since `ans` was initially set to `n`, the new value of `ans` will be `n + (n + 2) // 4`.

Let's break down the calculation:
- `b` is 2, so `b * b` equals 4.
- The expression `(n + 2) // 4` performs integer division, which means it will take the floor of the division result.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4`.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `b`, `t`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers derived from the input string such that `min(n, m)` must be at least 2, `b` is 2, `t` is greater than 0, `T` is 0, `ans` is `n + (n + 2) // 4`**.
