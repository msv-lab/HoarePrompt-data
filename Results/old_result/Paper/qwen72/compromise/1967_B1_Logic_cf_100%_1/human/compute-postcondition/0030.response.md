The code snippet `[n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]` converts the values of `n` and `m` to integers. Since `n` and `m` are updated from user input, their new values are the integer representations of the inputs.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `b` is 5, `t` is greater than 2, `T` is 2, `ans` is 6**
