You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        ans = n
        for b in range(2, min(n, m) + 1):
            ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input, where both are positive integers between 1 and 2 * 10^6. It then calculates a value `ans` starting from `n` and adds to it the result of `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each integer `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. Finally, it prints the calculated value `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `n`. This is because for every `a` from 1 to `n`, the pair `(a, 1)` always satisfies the condition since \(a + 1\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1)\).

3. **Loop for `b`**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. This is because `b` must be at least 2 and cannot exceed either `n` or `m`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program updates `ans` using the formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.
   - However, this formula is incorrect. The correct condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct way to check the condition is to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and count the pairs that satisfy the condition.
   - The current formula `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` does not correctly implement the required condition.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). It uses an incorrect formula to update the answer, which will lead to incorrect results for most test cases.
