You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` and two binary strings `d` and `e`. It then processes these strings to find the index `k` where the substring of `d` up to `k` can be found in `e` in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively. The function prints the value of `k` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is such that `a` is the number of test cases, `i` is `a - 1`, `b` is the last read integer representing the length of the binary string `d`, `c` is the last read integer, `d` is the last read binary string, `e` is the last read binary string, and `k` is the last computed index.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the prefix of string `a` is a subsequence of string `b` correctly. Specifically, the logic for updating `k` and checking the subsequence is flawed. 

Here is a counterexample:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 4
  10011
  1110
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

The program incorrectly outputs `1` instead of `2` because it does not correctly track the position in `b` where the next character of `a` should be found. The variable `k` is used to track the position in `b`, but it is reset incorrectly when a character is found, leading to the wrong result.
