Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, `j` is 0, and the element `d[j]` is present in the slice `e[k-1:]`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement.***
