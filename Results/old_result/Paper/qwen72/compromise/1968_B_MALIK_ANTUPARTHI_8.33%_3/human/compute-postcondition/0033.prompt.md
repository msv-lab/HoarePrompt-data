Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer input and must be greater than 0, `b` is now an integer, `c` is now an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(b):
    if d[j] in e[k:]:
        k = e.index(d[j]) + 1
        if k == c or j == b - 1:
            k = j + 1
            break
    else:
        k = j
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `k` is 0, `j` is 0. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]`, then `k` is updated to `e.index(d[j]) + 1`, and `d[j]` is present in the slice `e[k-1:]`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement. If `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` remains 0, `j` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1. If `d[1]` is in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[1]) + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, then the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` and `j` retain their updated values. If `d[1]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` remains 0, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2. If `d[2]` is in `e[k:]`, `k` is updated to `e.index(d[2]) + 1`. If `k` equals `c` or `j` equals `b - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `k` and `j` retain their updated values. If `d[2]` is not in `e[k:]`, `k` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
