Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `b` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
