Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer input and must be greater than 0, `b` is now an integer, `c` is now an integer, `i` is 0, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part into an integer. The variable `b` is now an integer, and `c` is also an integer. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `i`) remain unchanged.
