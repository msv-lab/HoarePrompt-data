To determine what will be printed by the `print(k)` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the context in which `k` is defined and updated.

### Initial State Breakdown:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This indicates the number of test cases.
- `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). These are the sizes of some lists or arrays.
- `a` is an integer greater than 1.
- `b` is an integer greater than 0.
- `c` is an integer.
- `i` is 2.
- The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). This is a constraint on the total input size.
- `d` is an input string.
- `e` is an input string.
- `j` is the index where the loop was broken or `b` if the loop completed. This indicates the loop termination condition.
- `k` is the last updated value of `k` based on the loop's execution.

### Analysis:
- The variable `k` is mentioned as being the last updated value based on the loop's execution. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the initial value of `k` or how it is updated within the loop.
- Without the loop code, it's impossible to determine the exact value of `k` after the loop completes or breaks.

### Conclusion:
Given the lack of information about the initial value of `k` and the loop's update mechanism, the best we can do is describe `k` in terms of its final state after the loop.

Output: **k (where k is the last updated value of k based on the loop's execution)**
