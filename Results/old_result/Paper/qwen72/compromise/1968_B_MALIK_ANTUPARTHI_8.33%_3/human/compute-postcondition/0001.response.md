The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `a` is an integer input, but it does not specify that `a` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `a` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an integer input and must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string of length m, the sum of all n values and the sum of all m values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0**
