The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers where `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and they represent the range of indices in the arrays `arr` and `cliques`. `clique` is a positive integer representing the clique number to be assigned to the vertices in the specified range.

The function returns an array where each element in the range from `left` to `right` (inclusive) is assigned the value of `clique`.
