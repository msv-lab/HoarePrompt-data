Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right` and represent the range of indices in the arrays `arr` and `cliques`. `clique` is a positive integer representing the clique number to be assigned to the vertices in the specified range. `small_element` is `left + 1`. `big_element` is `right + 1`. `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`. `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - mid`.
- The other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, `big_element`, `mid`) remain unchanged.
- The expression `right - left + 1` represents the total number of elements in the range from `left` to `right`, inclusive.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, so `not_mid` is the total number of elements in the range minus `mid`.
