### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to `n` to `n` vertices.
   - We need to create a graph where an edge exists between vertices \(i\) and \(j\) if \(|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k\).
   - We need to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
     - It iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array` to fill the arrays.
     - It prints the modified `arr`, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` array.

   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - It fills the `arr` array with a sequence of integers from `left + 1` to `right + 1`.
     - It sets the `cliquess` array from index `left` to `right` with the value `clique`.
     - The function ensures that the elements in `arr` are distinct and within the range [1, n].

3. **Behavior and Output:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The `make_array` function correctly fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays to ensure that each segment of the array forms a clique.
   - The output format matches the problem requirements:
     - The first line prints the `arr` array.
     - The second line prints the number of cliques.
     - The third line prints the `cliquess` array, which indicates the clique each vertex belongs to.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For small values of `k`, the number of cliques will be larger, and the function should handle this correctly.
   - For large values of `k`, the number of cliques will be smaller, and the function should handle this correctly.
   - The function should work for the boundary conditions of `n` and `k`.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The function `make_array` ensures that the elements in `arr` are distinct and form a sequence.
   - The function `func_1` correctly partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The output format and values are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. It assigns distinct integers to the vertices, creates the graph, and partitions it into the minimum number of cliques. The output format and values are correct.

**Correctness: True**
