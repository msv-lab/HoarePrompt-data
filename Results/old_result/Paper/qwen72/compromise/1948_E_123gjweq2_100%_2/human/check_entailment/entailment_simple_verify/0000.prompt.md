You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when \( k \) is larger than \( n \). According to the problem description, \( k \) can be up to \( 2n \). However, the function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which will always be 1 when \( k \geq n \). This means that the program will always try to form a single clique, regardless of the value of \( k \), which is not necessarily the correct approach.

For example, consider the input \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \). The expected output should be a single clique, but the program will not correctly form the cliques because it does not handle the edge case where \( k \) is very large relative to \( n \). The function `make_array` will be called with `left = 0`, `right = 7`, and `clique = 1`, but the logic inside `make_array` will not correctly assign the elements to form a valid clique.

To verify this, let's run the program with the input \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \):

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique

# Test case
func_1(8, 16)
```

The output will be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

However, the correct output should be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

The program does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) is very large, leading to incorrect partitioning of the graph into cliques. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
