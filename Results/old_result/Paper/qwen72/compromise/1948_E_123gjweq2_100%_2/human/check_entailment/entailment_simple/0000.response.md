Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Clique Calculation**: The program calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`. This is a valid approach because the number of cliques should be the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`.

3. **Array Initialization**: The arrays `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to the correct length `n`.

4. **Function `make_array`**:
   - The function `make_array` is responsible for filling the segments of `arr` and `cliquess` with appropriate values.
   - It divides the segment `[left, right]` into two parts: `mid` and `not_mid`.
   - The first part (`mid`) is filled with increasing values starting from `small_element`.
   - The second part (`not_mid`) is filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.
   - Both parts are assigned the same `clique` number in `cliquess`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the `arr` array, which should contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It prints the number of cliques.
   - It prints the `cliquess` array, which should contain the clique numbers for each vertex.

6. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is not perfectly divisible by `k` by using `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)` to ensure the right boundary does not exceed `n - 1`.

7. **Correctness of Clique Assignment**:
   - The program ensures that each vertex is assigned a unique integer from 1 to `n`.
   - The program correctly assigns each vertex to a clique, ensuring that the number of cliques is minimized.
   - The vertices within each clique are connected based on the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k`.

However, there is a critical issue in the program:

- **Incorrect Clique Assignment**: The `cliquess` array is not being updated correctly. The function `make_array` should update the `cliquess` array, but it is only partially doing so. Specifically, the second loop in `make_array` should update the `cliquess` array for the `not_mid` part, but it is not.

Given this issue, the program will not correctly partition the graph into cliques, and the `cliquess` array will not reflect the correct clique assignments.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the issue, the `make_array` function should correctly update the `cliquess` array for both the `mid` and `not_mid` parts. Here is the corrected version of the `make_array` function:

```python
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
```

With this correction, the program should correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and output the correct results.
