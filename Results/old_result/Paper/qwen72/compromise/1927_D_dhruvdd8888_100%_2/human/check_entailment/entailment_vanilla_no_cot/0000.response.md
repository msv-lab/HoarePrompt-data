Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is called within a loop for each test case, but the function itself reads the input again, which is redundant and could cause issues with the input stream.

2. **Logic for Finding Pairs**: The logic for finding pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. The program attempts to use a list `arr` to store ranges of consecutive equal elements, but the way it processes and checks these ranges is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Use of `bisect_left`**: The `bisect_left` function is used to find the index in `arr` where the range `[l, r]` starts, but the program does not correctly handle the cases where the range `[l, r]` does not contain any different elements.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the entire range `[l, r]` consists of the same element.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is not consistent with the problem description. The program should output `-1 -1` if no such pair exists, but it does not always do so correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import *
from math import log, log2, pow, gcd, ceil, floor
from heapq import *
import sys
from bisect import *

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    tc = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(tc):
        N = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        nums = list(map(int, data[index:index + N]))
        index += N
        Q = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        # Preprocess the array to find the first and last occurrence of each element
        first_occurrence = {}
        last_occurrence = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if num not in first_occurrence:
                first_occurrence[num] = i
            last_occurrence[num] = i
        
        for _ in range(Q):
            l = int(data[index]) - 1
            r = int(data[index + 1]) - 1
            index += 2
            
            # Check if there are different elements in the range [l, r]
            unique_elements = set(nums[l:r + 1])
            if len(unique_elements) > 1:
                # Find the first two different elements
                for i in range(l, r + 1):
                    for j in range(i + 1, r + 1):
                        if nums[i] != nums[j]:
                            results.append(f"{i + 1} {j + 1}")
                            break
                    else:
                        continue
                    break
            else:
                results.append("-1 -1")
    
    print("\n".join(results))

func_1()
```

This corrected version:
- Reads all input data at once and processes it.
- Preprocesses the array to find the first and last occurrence of each element.
- For each query, it checks if there are different elements in the range `[l, r]` and finds the first pair of different elements.
- Ensures the output format is correct and consistent with the problem description.
