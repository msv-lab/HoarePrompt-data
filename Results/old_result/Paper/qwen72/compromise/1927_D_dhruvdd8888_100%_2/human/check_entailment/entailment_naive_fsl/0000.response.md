Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given range `[l, r]` is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

Actual Output:
```
2 3
-1 -1
-1 -1
```

The program fails to correctly identify the pair `(1, 3)` for the query `(1, 3)` because it does not properly handle the case where the range `[l, r]` contains multiple different elements but the first and last elements in the range are the same. This leads to incorrect output for some queries.
