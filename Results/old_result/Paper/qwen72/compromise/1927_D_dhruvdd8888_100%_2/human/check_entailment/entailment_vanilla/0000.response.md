### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `N`.
   - It reads the array `nums` and appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of the array.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It creates an empty list `arr` to store tuples of the form `(start, end, number)`.

3. **Building the `arr` List:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and groups consecutive identical elements.
   - For each group, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`, where `1 + s` is the start index of the group, `i` is the end index of the group, and `num` is the value of the elements in the group.
   - It updates `s` to the current index `i` and `num` to the current element `nums[i]`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index is greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It retrieves the tuple `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if there is a pair of different elements within the range `(l, r)`:
     - If `s > l`, it checks if `s == 1` or `s > r` to determine if there is a valid pair.
     - If `e >= r`, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no valid pair.
     - If `e < N` or `e < l`, it prints `(s, e + 1)` as a valid pair.
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `s > l`**
  - This means the start of the current group is greater than `l`.
  - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it means the group starts at the beginning or outside the range, so no valid pair exists.
  - Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)` as a valid pair.

- **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
  - This means the end of the current group is greater than or equal to `r`.
  - If this is true, it means the entire range `(l, r)` is within a single group of identical elements, so no valid pair exists.

- **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
  - This means the end of the current group is within the array and not before `l`.
  - It prints `(s, e + 1)` as a valid pair.

- **Else:**
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Issues:
- **Appending Sentinel Value:**
  - The program appends `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases. However, this might not be necessary if the logic is correctly implemented.

- **Indexing and Conditions:**
  - The conditions and indexing logic are complex and might not cover all edge cases correctly.
  - For example, the condition `if s > l` might not always be the correct check for finding a valid pair.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program does not separate outputs for different test cases with empty lines, which is not a mandatory requirement but might be expected for clarity.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is complex and might not handle all edge cases correctly. The conditions for determining valid pairs are not robust enough, and the sentinel value might introduce unnecessary complexity.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has logical issues and might not correctly handle all edge cases, especially in the conditions used to determine valid pairs.
