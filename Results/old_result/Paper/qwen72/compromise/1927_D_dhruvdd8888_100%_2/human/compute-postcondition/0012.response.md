To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and the conditions under which it operates. Let's break down the loop and its effects:

1. **Loop Head**: The loop runs for a number of iterations equal to the integer value read from the input.
2. **Loop Body**:
   - Reads two integers `l` and `r` from the input.
   - Uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the tuple `(l, 0, 0)` would be inserted to maintain order.
   - Retrieves the tuple `(s, e, num)` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`.
   - Checks various conditions and prints the appropriate output:
     - If `s > l` and `s == 1` or `s > r`, prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If `s > l` and `s != 1` and `s <= r`, prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If `e >= r`, prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If `e < N` or `e < l`, prints `(s, e + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, prints `(-1, -1)`.

The loop does not modify the variables `N`, `nums`, `arr`, or `LA`. It only reads input and prints output based on the conditions. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged after the loop finishes.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is the same integer value read from the input.
- `nums` is the same list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with `-1` appended to the end.
- `s` is `N`.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is `-1`.
- `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` that contains the same integer value, and the integer value itself.
- `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be:
- `N` remains the same.
- `nums` remains the same.
- `s` remains `N`.
- `e` remains 0.
- `num` remains `-1`.
- `arr` remains the same.
- `LA` remains `len(arr) - 1`.

Output State: **N remains the same, nums remains the same, s remains N, e remains 0, num remains -1, arr remains the same, LA remains len(arr) - 1.**
