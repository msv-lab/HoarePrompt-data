Output State: **`N` is the same integer value read from the input, `nums` is the same list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with `-1` appended to the end, `s` is `N`, `e` is 0, `num` is `-1`, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end indices of a segment in `nums` that contains the same integer value, and the integer value itself, `LA` is `len(arr) - 1`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `LA` is assigned the value `len(arr) - 1`, where `len(arr)` is the length of the list `arr`.
- All other variables (`N`, `nums`, `s`, `e`, `num`, `arr`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
