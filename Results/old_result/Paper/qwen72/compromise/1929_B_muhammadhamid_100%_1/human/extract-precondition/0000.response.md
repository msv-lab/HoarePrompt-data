Precondition: **The function should take two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), and k is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2).**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be:

```python
def func(n, k):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, and k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2.**
