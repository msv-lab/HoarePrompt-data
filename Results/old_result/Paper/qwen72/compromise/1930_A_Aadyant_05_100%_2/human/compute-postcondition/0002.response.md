To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for num in range(int(n)):
```
This loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `num` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration up to `n-1`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7
- `final` is an empty list

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The variable `num` will start from 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `final` is an empty list, `num` is 0**
