Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, `find` is an integer (1 ≤ `find` ≤ `n`), `n` is the length of `array`.** 

Explanation: The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the `array`. The `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and `find` is an integer that needs to be found in the permutation, with `find` still being within the range 1 to `n`.
