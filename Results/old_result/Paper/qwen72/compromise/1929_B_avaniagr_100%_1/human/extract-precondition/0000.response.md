Precondition: **The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, 2 <= n <= 10^8, and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.**
