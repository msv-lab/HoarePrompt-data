Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly solves the problem by calculating the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size \( n \times n \) to ensure that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell. The logic is based on the following observations:

1. **For \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)**: In this case, the minimum number of cells to be colored is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is because each cell can contribute to at most 2 diagonals, and thus, to cover \( k \) diagonals, you need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.

2. **For \( k = 4n - 3 \)**: This special case requires \( 2n - 1 \) cells to be colored. This is because the grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, and to cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals, you need to color all cells along one of the main diagonals (which covers \( 2n - 1 \) diagonals) and one additional cell to cover the remaining diagonal.

3. **For \( k = 4n - 2 \)**: In this case, you need to color \( 2n \) cells, which is the total number of cells along both main diagonals. This ensures that all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The program reads the input from stdin, processes each test case, and prints the correct output for each case. The logic and the conditions used in the program are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
