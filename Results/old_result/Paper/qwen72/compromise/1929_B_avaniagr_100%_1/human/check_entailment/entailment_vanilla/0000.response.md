### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \) (2n-1 main diagonals from top-left to bottom-right and 2n-1 main diagonals from top-right to bottom-left).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks the value of \( k \) and prints the minimum number of cells to be colored based on the following conditions:
     - If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - If \( k = 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n - 1 \).
     - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \).

3. **Correctness of Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)**
     - This condition covers the case where \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 4n - 4 \). In such cases, the minimum number of cells to be colored is \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal). Therefore, to cover \( k \) diagonals, we need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.
   - **Condition 2: \( k = 4n - 3 \)**
     - This condition covers the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \). In such cases, the minimum number of cells to be colored is \( 2n - 1 \).
     - This is because to cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells along one of the main diagonals and one of the anti-diagonals, except for one cell. This results in \( 2n - 1 \) cells.
   - **Condition 3: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
     - This condition covers the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \). In such cases, the minimum number of cells to be colored is \( 2n \).
     - This is because to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells along one of the main diagonals and one of the anti-diagonals, which results in \( 2n \) cells.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 4 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (4 \leq 8), so the program prints \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 4 diagonals.
   - **Example 2: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (3 \leq 8), so the program prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.
   - **Example 3: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 10 \)**
     - \( k = 4n - 2 \) (10 = 10), so the program prints \( 2n = 6 \).
     - This is correct because 6 cells are needed to cover all 10 diagonals.
   - **Example 4: \( n = 3 \), \( k = 9 \)**
     - \( k = 4n - 3 \) (9 = 9), so the program prints \( 2n - 1 = 5 \).
     - This is correct because 5 cells are needed to cover 9 diagonals.
   - **Example 5: \( n = 4 \), \( k = 7 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (7 \leq 12), so the program prints \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \).
     - This is correct because 4 cells can cover 7 diagonals.
   - **Example 6: \( n = 7 \), \( k = 11 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (11 \leq 24), so the program prints \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \).
     - This is correct because 6 cells can cover 11 diagonals.
   - **Example 7: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)**
     - \( k \leq 4n - 4 \) (3 \leq 4), so the program prints \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \).
     - This is correct because 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to determine the minimum number of cells to be colored.
