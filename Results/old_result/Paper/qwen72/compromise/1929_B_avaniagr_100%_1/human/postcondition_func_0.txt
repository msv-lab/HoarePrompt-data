The function reads from standard input, ignoring the first line, and processes each subsequent line as a test case. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, the function prints a calculated value based on the following conditions: if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`; if `k` is equal to `4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`; if `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`. The function does not return any values and does not modify any input parameters.
