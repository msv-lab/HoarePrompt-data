#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 <= t <= 1000, 2 <= n <= 10^8, and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        n, k = map(int, s.split())
        
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n)
        
    #State: The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The loop iterates over the input test cases and prints the calculated values based on the conditions provided. The variables `n` and `k` are updated for each iteration according to the input test cases, but they are not stored or returned by the function. The state of `t` and `test_cases` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from standard input, ignoring the first line, and processes each subsequent line as a test case. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, the function prints a calculated value based on the following conditions: if `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4`, it prints the ceiling of `k / 2`; if `k` is equal to `4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`; if `k` is equal to `4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`. The function does not return any values and does not modify any input parameters.
