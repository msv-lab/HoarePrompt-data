The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. The constraints are 1 <= t <= 1000, 2 <= n <= 10^8, and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2. The function returns the results of processing each test case based on the given parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. The function processes each test case and returns the results.**
