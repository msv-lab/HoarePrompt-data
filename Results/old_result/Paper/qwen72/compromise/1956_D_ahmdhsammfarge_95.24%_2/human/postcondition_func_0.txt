The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers with a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 18. It returns a tuple `(r, l)` representing the starting index `r` and the ending index `l` of the subarray that, when removed, maximizes the sum of the remaining elements plus the square of the subarray's length. The input list `lst` remains unchanged.
