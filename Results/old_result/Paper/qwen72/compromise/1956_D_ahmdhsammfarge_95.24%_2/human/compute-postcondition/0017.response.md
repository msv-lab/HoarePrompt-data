Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[4:]) + 16`, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, and `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[4:]) + 16`.
- The code snippet `over_sum = sm` assigns the value of `sm` to `over_sum`.
- Since `sm` is already defined and calculated, `over_sum` now holds the same value as `sm`.
- The value of `l` is not affected by this assignment, so it remains 3.
- The values of `r`, `i`, and `j` are also not affected and remain 0, 0, and 3, respectively.
- The condition `if sm > over_sum, then l is 2` is not relevant here because `over_sum` is now equal to `sm`, and the condition is not met.
- Therefore, the output state includes all the initial values and the updated value of `over_sum`.
