Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `5 ≤ n ≤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 5 to the end of `lst` plus 9. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is equal to `sm`, `r` is 2, and `l` is 4.**

Explanation: The code snippet `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `r` and the value of `j` (which is 4) to `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `r` and `l` while keeping the initial state of the other variables intact.
