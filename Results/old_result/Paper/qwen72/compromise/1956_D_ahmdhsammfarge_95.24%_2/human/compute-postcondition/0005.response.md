Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, then `ops` no longer includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, r + 1]`. Otherwise, `ops` still includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**
