Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is 2, `over_sum` is equal to `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`.**

The value of `over_sum` has been updated to be equal to `sm`, which is `sum(lst[3:]) + 9`. All other variables remain unchanged.
