Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0 or [1, 2], `l` is the index j where the condition `sm > over_sum` was last satisfied or 2, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`. If `sm > over_sum`, `r` is set to [1, 2], `l` is set to 2, and `over_sum` is updated to the current value of `sm`. Otherwise, the values of `r`, `l`, and `over_sum` remain unchanged.***
