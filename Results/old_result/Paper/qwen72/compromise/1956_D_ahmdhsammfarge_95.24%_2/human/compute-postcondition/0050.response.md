The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the length of `lst`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `5 ≤ n ≤ 18`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 4.
- `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 5 to the end of `lst` plus 9.
- If `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated to `sm` and `l` is 4. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is 5.
- `lst` must still have a length `n` where `5 ≤ n ≤ 18` for the loop to continue.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `5 ≤ n ≤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 5 to the end of `lst` plus 9. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `over_sum` is updated to `sm` and `l` is 4. Otherwise, `over_sum` remains unchanged and `l` is 3.**
