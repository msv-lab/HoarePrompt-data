Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation, and `ops` now includes an additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0.**

The code appends the list `[r + 1, l + 1]` to the `ops` list. The values of `r` and `l` remain the same, and the precondition that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst) and that the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0 are still valid. The `lst` list is also unchanged. The only change is that `ops` now includes the new range `[r + 1, l + 1]`.
