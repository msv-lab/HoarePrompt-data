Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation. The sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is now filled with the value `n`, where `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is now `n`, and `ops` now includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`.**
