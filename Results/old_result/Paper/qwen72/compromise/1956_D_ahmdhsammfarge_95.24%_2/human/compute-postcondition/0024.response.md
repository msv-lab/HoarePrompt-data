Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is [1, 2], `l` is 2, `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`, and the current value of `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**

The code snippet updates the variables `r` and `l`. The list `r` is now set to `[1, 2]`, and `l` is updated to the value of `j`, which is 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
