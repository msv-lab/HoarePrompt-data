Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length `n` where `4 ≤ n ≤ 18`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `sm` is the sum of the first 2 elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index 4 to the end of `lst` plus 4, `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, `r` is 2, `l` is 3**. 

The variables `r` and `l` are now assigned the values of `i` and `j` respectively, which are 2 and 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
