Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 2 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0, `l` is 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `sm` is equal to `sum(lst[:0]) + sum(lst[4:]) + 16`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, then `l` is 2. Otherwise, `l` remains 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `r, l = [i, j]` assigns the values of `i` and `j` to `r` and `l` respectively.
- Initially, `i` is 0 and `j` is 3.
- After the code execution, `r` is assigned the value of `i` (which is 0), and `l` is assigned the value of `j` (which is 3).
- The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, and `sm` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `l` (whether `sm` > `over_sum`) is not affected by the code, so the state of `l` based on this condition remains the same as in the initial state.
