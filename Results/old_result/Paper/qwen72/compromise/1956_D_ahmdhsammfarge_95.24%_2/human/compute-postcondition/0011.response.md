Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts parameters `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops`, where `r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, and `ops` is a list of operation ranges. It appends the operation range `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` multiple times, and if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, it appends the same range again. The function then calls another function `func_2` with `r`, `l`, and `ops`. Finally, it fills the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` with the value `n`, where `n` is `l - r + 1`, ensuring the minimum value in this sublist is `n`. The function returns the modified `lst`. **
