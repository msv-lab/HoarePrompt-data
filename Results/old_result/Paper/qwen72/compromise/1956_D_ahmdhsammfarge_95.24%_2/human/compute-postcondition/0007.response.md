Output State: **`r` and `l` are integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `lst` is a list of integers, `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the range of an operation. The minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is not 0, and `ops` now includes the additional inner list `[r + 1, l + 1]`. `n` is equal to `l - r + 1`.** 

The code snippet calculates the length of the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `r`, `l`, `lst`, and `ops` remain unchanged. The new value of `n` is the number of elements in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`.
