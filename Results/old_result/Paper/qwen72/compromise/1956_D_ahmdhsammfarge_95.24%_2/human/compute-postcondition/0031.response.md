Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers of length n where 3 ≤ n ≤ 18, `r` is 0 or [1, 2] if `sm` ≤ `over_sum`, otherwise `r` is [1, 3]. `l` is 2 if `sm` ≤ `over_sum`, otherwise `l` is 3. `over_sum` is the maximum value of `sm` found during the loop or the current value of `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`. `i` is 1, `j` is 3, and `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from index `j + 1` to the end of `lst` plus 16.***
