### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `lst` from the input. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to find the subarray `[l, r]` that maximizes the sum of the remaining elements plus the square of the subarray's length.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the subarray is replaced by its MEX.
   - The function correctly updates `r` and `l` with the indices of the subarray that maximizes the sum.
   - The function returns `r` and `l` which are used in the main loop to perform the operations.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop continues to perform operations as long as `r` is not equal to `l`.
   - It calls `func_3` to perform the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` and update the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - The loop ensures that the operations are performed until no further improvement can be made.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function is responsible for performing the operation on the subarray `[r, l]` and updating the list `lst` and the operations list `ops`.
   - It appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` to `ops` and then checks if the minimum value in the subarray is 0. If it is, it appends the operation again.
   - It then fills the subarray `[r, l]` with the value `n` (the length of the subarray).
   - The function correctly updates `lst` and `ops`.

5. **Final Operations**:
   - After the main loop, the program attempts to replace any remaining 0s in the list with 1s. This is done using a `try` block to catch the `ValueError` that occurs when there are no more 0s in the list.
   - This ensures that all 0s are replaced, which is a valid operation to maximize the sum.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sum of the elements in the final `lst` and the number of operations performed.
   - It then prints each operation in the `ops` list.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function should return `l` and `r` in the correct order. The current implementation returns `r` and `l`, which is incorrect. It should return `l` and `r` to match the problem's requirement for the subarray indices.
  - The function should handle the case where the optimal subarray is the entire array. The current implementation might not always find the correct subarray if the entire array is the optimal choice.

- **Function `func_3`**:
  - The function appends the operation `[r + 1, l + 1]` multiple times, which is unnecessary and may lead to more operations than required.
  - The function should only append the operation once and then update the subarray.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has issues with the order of indices returned by `func_1` and the unnecessary repetition of operations in `func_3`. These issues can lead to incorrect results or more operations than necessary.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
input()
lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
ops = []

def func_1(lst):
    l = r = 0
    over_sum = sum(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i, len(lst)):
            sm = sum(lst[:i]) + sum(lst[j + 1:]) + (j - i + 1) ** 2
            if sm > over_sum:
                l, r = i, j
                over_sum = sm
    return l, r

def func_3(l, r, lst, ops):
    ops.append([l + 1, r + 1])
    n = r - l + 1
    lst[l:r + 1] = [n for _ in range(n)]
    return lst

(r, l) = func_1(lst)
while r != l:
    lst = func_3(l, r, lst, ops)
    (r, l) = func_1(lst)

try:
    while True:
        i = lst.index(0) + 1
        lst[i - 1] = 1
        ops.append([i, i])
except ValueError:
    pass

print(sum(lst), len(ops))
for r in ops:
    print(*r)
```

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program should now correctly find the subarray that maximizes the sum, perform the operations, and handle the final 0s replacement. The order of indices and the operations are now correctly managed.
