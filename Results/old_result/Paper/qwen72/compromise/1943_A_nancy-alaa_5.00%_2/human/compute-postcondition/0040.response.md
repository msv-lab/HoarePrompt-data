Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `first` is False, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `mpp` is a dictionary-like object that maps each integer in `arr` to its frequency of occurrence.**

The value of `first` is set to False, overriding any previous value it might have had. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, and `mpp`) remain unchanged and retain their initial values and properties.
