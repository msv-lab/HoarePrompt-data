Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations, `i` is `n-1`, `first` is True.**

In natural language: After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged (it is greater than or equal to the number of iterations the loop has completed). The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last index the loop iterated over. The variable `first` is set to True, indicating that at least one integer in `arr` has a frequency of 1, and the loop did not break due to the conditions specified.
