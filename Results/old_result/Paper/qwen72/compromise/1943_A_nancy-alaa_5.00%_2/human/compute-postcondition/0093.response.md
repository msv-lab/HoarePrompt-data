Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `first` is True.
- If `i` is not a key in the dictionary `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- If `i` is a key in `mpp` and `mpp[i]` is 1, the program continues without modifying `n` or `i`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 1.
2. **Dictionary `mpp`**: The initial state does not provide any explicit values for the dictionary `mpp`. However, it mentions that if `i` (which is 1) is not a key in `mpp`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This implies that the code snippet is part of a larger loop or conditional block, but for the purpose of this task, we only need to focus on the value of `i` at the point where the `print` statement is executed.
3. **Execution of `print(i)`**: Since `i` is explicitly set to 1 and no modifications to `i` are mentioned in the initial state, the `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

### Conclusion:
The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 1.

Output: **1**
