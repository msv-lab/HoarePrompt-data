Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `i` is a key in the dictionary `mpp`.
- `mpp[i]` is 1.
- `first` is true.

The code snippet to analyze is:
```python
print(i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The initial state explicitly states that `i` is 0.
2. **Print Statement**: The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

### Output:
The value of `i` is 0, so the print statement will output:
Output: **0**
