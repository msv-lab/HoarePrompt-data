The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`. The loop is controlled by the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, which is not affected by the variables `n`, `i`, or `first`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a fixed number of times, it does not need to be explicitly adjusted. The loop will execute the specified number of times regardless of the state of `n`, `i`, or `first`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same for `n`, `i`, and `first`, but the loop counter (represented by `_`) is incremented by 1. However, since `_` is not tracked in the state, we do not need to modify it.

State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that occurs exactly once and is less than `n`, otherwise `first` is False**
