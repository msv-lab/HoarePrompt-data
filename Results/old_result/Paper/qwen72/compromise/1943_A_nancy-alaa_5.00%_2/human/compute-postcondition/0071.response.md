Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `n-1`, `first` is True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that occurs exactly once and is less than `n`, otherwise `first` is False.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop because it is only used in the loop condition and is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is incremented from 0 to `n-1` by the loop, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n-1`.
- `first` will be set to True if there is at least one integer in `arr` that occurs exactly once and is less than `n`. If no such integer exists, `first` will remain False. The loop will break if it encounters an integer `i` that is not in `mpp.keys()`, or if `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and `mpp[i]` is 1 and `first` is already True.
