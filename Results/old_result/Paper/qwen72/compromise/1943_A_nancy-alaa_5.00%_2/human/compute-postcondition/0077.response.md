The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to `n-1` before the loop starts, but in the loop head, `i` is reset to 0 for the first iteration.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `i` being `n-1` is irrelevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted in the context of the loop's execution.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
