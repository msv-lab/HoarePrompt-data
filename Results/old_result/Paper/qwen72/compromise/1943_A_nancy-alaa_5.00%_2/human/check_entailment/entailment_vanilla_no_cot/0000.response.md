Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given Python program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The program attempts to find the MEX of the array `c` by checking if each integer from 0 to `n-1` is present in the array `arr` and whether it appears only once. However, this approach does not account for the turn-based nature of the game and the optimal strategies of both players.

### Issues:
1. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**:
   - The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It does not consider the optimal moves for each player to either maximize or minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program checks if `i` is not in the keys of `mpp` and prints `i` if it is not. This is a correct way to find the MEX of the initial array `arr`, but it does not simulate the game.
   - The program also checks if `mpp[i] == 1` and whether `first` is `True` or `False`, but this logic is flawed and does not correctly determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game is played.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game and consider the optimal moves for both players. Here is a correct approach:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Element**:
   - Use a `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in the array `arr`.

2. **Simulate the Game**:
   - Alice and Bob will take turns picking elements from `arr`.
   - Alice will always pick the smallest element that appears only once (if available) to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will always pick the smallest element that appears more than once (if available) to minimize the MEX.
   - If there are no elements that appear only once, Alice will pick the smallest element.
   - If there are no elements that appear more than once, Bob will pick the smallest element.

3. **Determine the MEX**:
   - After the game ends, the MEX of the array `c` can be determined by finding the smallest non-negative integer that is not in `c`.

### Correct Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        mpp = Counter(arr)
        
        c = []
        for i in range(n):
            if mpp[i] > 0:
                if mpp[i] == 1:
                    if len(c) % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                        c.append(i)
                        mpp[i] -= 1
                else:
                    if len(c) % 2 == 1:  # Bob's turn
                        mpp[i] -= 1
                    else:
                        c.append(i)
                        mpp[i] -= 1
            else:
                print(i)
                break
        else:
            print(n)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Program:
- **Counter**: We use `Counter` to count the frequency of each element in `arr`.
- **Game Simulation**: We simulate the game by iterating through the elements from 0 to `n-1` and deciding which player (Alice or Bob) should pick the element based on the turn and the frequency of the element.
- **MEX Calculation**: If we find an element `i` that is not in `mpp` or has a frequency of 0, we print `i` as the MEX. If we finish the loop without finding such an element, the MEX is `n`.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and the final score is correctly determined.
