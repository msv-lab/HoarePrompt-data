### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` she constructs.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - Both players play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick the smallest element that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - If an element appears only once in `a`, Alice will pick it on her first turn to ensure it is in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It iterates through the range `0` to `n-1` to find the smallest element that is not in `c` or appears only once in `a` and is picked by Alice.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `mpp` is a `Counter` object that counts the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
     - `first` is a boolean flag to track if Alice has picked an element that appears only once.
   - **Iteration:**
     - The program iterates through the range `0` to `n-1`.
     - If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, it means `i` is not in `arr`, and thus the MEX is `i`.
     - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and appears only once, and `first` is `True`, it means Alice has already picked an element that appears only once, so Bob will pick `i` and the MEX is `i`.
     - If `i` is in `mpp.keys()` and appears only once, and `first` is `False`, it means Alice will pick `i` on her first turn, and `first` is set to `True`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements from `0` to `n-1` are in `arr` and each appears more than once, the MEX will be `n`.
   - If there is an element that appears only once, Alice will pick it on her first turn, and Bob will try to prevent the MEX from being higher.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest element that is not in `c` or appears only once in `a` and is picked by Alice.
   - The logic ensures that the MEX is calculated based on the optimal play of both players.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the optimal strategy for both players.

**Correctness: True**
