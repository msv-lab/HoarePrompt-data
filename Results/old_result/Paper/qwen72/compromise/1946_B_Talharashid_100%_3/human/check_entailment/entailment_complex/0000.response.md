### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the loop `for i in range(int(input()))`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` from the input and then reads a list of integers `l` of length `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `c` is initialized to 0, which will be used to keep track of the current sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - `maxi` is initialized to 0, which will store the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray found during the iteration.

3. **Loop to Find Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - The loop `for ele in l` iterates through each element in the list `l`.
   - If the element `ele` is negative and the current sum `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, it resets `c` to 0 and updates `maxi` to the maximum of the current `c` and `maxi`.
   - Otherwise, it adds `ele` to `c` and updates `maxi` to the maximum of the current `c` and `maxi`.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - After the loop, `maxi` is updated one last time to ensure it holds the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray.
   - The final result is calculated as `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula is intended to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the array.

5. **Output:**
   - The result for each test case is printed.

### Analysis of the Formula:
- The formula `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is derived from the idea that the maximum subarray sum `maxi` can be added to the array `k` times, and the total sum of the array is adjusted accordingly.
- The term `2 ** k * maxi` represents the sum of the maximum subarray added `k` times.
- The term `- maxi` is subtracted to avoid double-counting the initial maximum subarray sum.
- The term `sum(l)` is the sum of the original array.

### Potential Issues:
- **Negative Subarrays:** The logic for handling negative subarrays is not entirely correct. The function resets `c` to 0 when a negative element is encountered, but it should consider the possibility of including negative elements if they can lead to a higher sum when combined with subsequent positive elements.
- **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle edge cases where the array contains only negative numbers or where the maximum subarray sum is negative. In such cases, the formula might not produce the correct result.

### Correctness:
- The function does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly those involving negative numbers and the possibility of the maximum subarray sum being negative.
- The logic for updating `maxi` and `c` is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The function does not correctly handle all possible input cases and edge conditions, leading to potential incorrect results.
