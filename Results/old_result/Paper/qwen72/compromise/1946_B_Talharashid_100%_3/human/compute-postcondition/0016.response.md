Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `c + ele`. `maxi` remains the maximum of `ele` and 0.**
