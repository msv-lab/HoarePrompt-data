Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.**

Explanation: The code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of `c` and the current value of `maxi`. Since `maxi` was initially the maximum of `c` and 0, and `c` is now `c + ele`, the new value of `maxi` will be the maximum of the updated `c` and the previous `maxi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
