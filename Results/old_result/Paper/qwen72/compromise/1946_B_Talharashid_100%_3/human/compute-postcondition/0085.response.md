The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and an integer `k` representing the number of operations. The function should accept the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer indicating the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case:
  - `a`: a list of integers, where each integer is within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
  - `n`: an integer representing the length of the list `a`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
  - `k`: an integer representing the number of operations, where 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.

The function returns the result of the operations for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts a list of integers `a`, an integer `n` representing the length of the list `a`, and an integer `k` representing the number of operations. The function returns the result of the operations for each test case.**
