The only objects in the loop head are the variable `ele` and the list `l`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If `l` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, and `ele` is the second element in the list `l`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `ele` will be the third element in the list `l`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, and `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. If `ele` < 0 and `c` <= `abs(ele)`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `c + ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and 0.**
