Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` remains 0 and `maxi` remains 0. Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele` and `maxi` is the maximum value between `ele` and 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`.
- If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, `c` remains 0, and `maxi` remains 0.
- Otherwise, `c` is set to `ele`, and `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `ele` and 0.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- The value of `ele` remains the second element in the list `l`.
