Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `c` is the sum of the non-negative subsequence of `l` that has the highest sum, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and the previous value of `maxi`.** 

The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of `c` and the previous value of `maxi`. All other variables remain unchanged.
