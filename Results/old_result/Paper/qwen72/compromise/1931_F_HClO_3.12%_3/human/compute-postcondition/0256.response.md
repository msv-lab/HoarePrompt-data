To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(m - 2):
```

The loop will execute if `m - 2` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2. The variable `_` is the loop iterator and will start from 0 by default. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `m` is assigned a value from the input.
- `a1` is assigned the first integer from the input if `m` is equal to 1.
- `l1` is assigned the remaining integers from the input if `m` is equal to 1.
- `a2` is assigned the first integer from the input.
- `l2` is assigned the remaining integers from the input.
- `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` that are not equal to `a2`.
- `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` that are not equal to `a1`.
- `val`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged.
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `m - 2` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2. The variable `_` will start from 0, and `t` must be greater than 0 initially to ensure the loop can execute.

State: **`m` must be greater than 2, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
