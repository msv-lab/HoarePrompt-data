Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. `i` is incremented by 1. If `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `idx1` and `idx2` are both set to `i + 1`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, if `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0` and `l1[i + p1] == a2`, `idx1` is set to `i + 1` and `p1` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to `i + 1` and `p2` is set to 1. If `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
