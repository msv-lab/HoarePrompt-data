Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 0, `a3` is the first integer from the last new input, `l3` is a list of the remaining integers from the last new input.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, and `p2` remain unchanged.
- The variable `val` now contains a list of `m - 2` tuples, where each tuple consists of the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input provided during the loop iterations.
- The variable `_` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variables `a3` and `l3` are set to the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from the last new input provided during the loop.
