Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: If `m` is equal to 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l1` is assigned the remaining integers from the input. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers. `a2` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l2` is assigned the remaining integers from the input. `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` that are not equal to `a2`. `val`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` that are not equal to `a1`. If `m` is not equal to 1, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(m - 2):
    input()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` must be greater than 2, `_` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, and the program waits for user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` must be greater than 3, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 0, and the program waits for user input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` must be greater than 4, `_` is 2, `t` must be greater than 0, and the program has received user input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
