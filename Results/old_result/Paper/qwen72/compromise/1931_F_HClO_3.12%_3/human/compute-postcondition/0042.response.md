The `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables do not change, but the control flow is altered. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 1, `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`. If `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, and `_` is set to `m - 3`. `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0, and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2`, `idx1` is `i`, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 1, `p2` is 0. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is `i`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 1. In both cases, if `i + max(p1, p2)` is equal to `n - 1`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values and conditions. We have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
