The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `m`. The loop can execute again if `m - 2` is greater than 0, which means `m` must be greater than 2. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not hold any specific value, it is incremented by 1 for each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `m` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

Given that the loop has already executed once (since `m` must be greater than 2), the throwaway variable `_` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must still be greater than 2, and the throwaway variable `_` is now 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `a1` is the first integer from the input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the input, `a2` is the first integer from the new input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, `_` is 1**
