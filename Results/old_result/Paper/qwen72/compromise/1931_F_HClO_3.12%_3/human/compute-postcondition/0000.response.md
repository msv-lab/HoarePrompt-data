Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are different), representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, where a_{i0} is the author of the screenshot and always appears at the top of the list. The sum of n · k for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all authors of the screenshots are different.**

The value of `t` is now set to the integer input provided by the user, which must be within the range 1 to 10^4. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
