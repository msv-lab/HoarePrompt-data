Postcondition: ***`val` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form `(a3, l3)`. If `l3` is not equal to the list comprehension `[i for i in l if i != a3]`, then `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the next tuple in `val`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `a3` and `l3` remain unchanged.***
