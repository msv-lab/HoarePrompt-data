The function `func` accepts parameters that represent multiple test cases. Each test case includes two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5`. These integers represent the number of chat participants and the number of participants who posted screenshots, respectively. Additionally, for each of the `k` participants who posted screenshots, there are `n` integers `a_{ij}` (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n, all a_{ij} are different), representing the order of participants shown to the participant `a_{i0}`, who is the author of the screenshot and always appears at the top of the list. The sum of `n · k` for all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`, and all authors of the screenshots are different.

The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating the order of participants shown to each screenshot author.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. For each test case, it also accepts the order of participants shown to each screenshot author. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating the order of participants shown to each screenshot author.**
