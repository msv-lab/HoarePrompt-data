Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1.**

**Natural Language Explanation:**
- The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, the loop checks if `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1`. If this condition is true, the loop breaks.
- If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, the loop further checks specific conditions:
  - If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, both `idx1` and `idx2` are set to `i`, and the loop breaks.
  - If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, `idx1` is set to `i` and `p1` is set to 1.
  - If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `idx2` is set to `i` and `p2` is set to 1.
  - If both `idx1` and `idx2` are non-negative, the loop breaks.
- If none of the above conditions are met, `i` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.
- After all iterations, if the loop has not broken due to any of the conditions, `i` will be `n - 2`, and `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, and `idx2` will remain unchanged from their initial values (0, 0, -1, -1 respectively).
