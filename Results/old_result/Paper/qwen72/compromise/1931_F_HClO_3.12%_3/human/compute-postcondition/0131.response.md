Output State: **`a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` is the second integer from the new input, `a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 1. If `m` is 1, the program retains all the above conditions.**

Explanation:
- The code `a1, *l1 = map(int, input().split())` updates `a1` to the first integer from the new input and `l1` to a list of the remaining integers from the new input.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this code snippet.
