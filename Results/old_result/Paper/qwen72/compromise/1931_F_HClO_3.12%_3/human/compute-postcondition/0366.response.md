Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` must contain at least `m - 2` tuples, each tuple consisting of an integer `a3` and a list of integers `l3`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, `m` must be greater than 2. If for all tuples in `val`, the list `l3` is equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding the integer `a3`, the loop completes and prints 'yes'. If any tuple in `val` does not satisfy this condition, the loop breaks and prints 'no'.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions (`n` > 3, `i` = `n - 2`, `p1` = 0, `p2` = 0, `idx1` = -1, `idx2` = -1, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, and `m` > 2) remain unchanged.
- The list `val` must contain at least `m - 2` tuples.
- For each tuple in `val`, the integer `a3` and the list `l3` must be such that `l3` is equal to the list `l` with the integer `a3` removed.
- If all tuples in `val` satisfy this condition, the loop completes and 'yes' is printed.
- If any tuple in `val` does not satisfy this condition, the loop breaks and 'no' is printed.
