Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `idx2` is 2, `p2` is 1.** 

The value of `p2` is now 1. The values of `n`, `i`, and `idx2` remain unchanged. The condition `i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1` is not affected by this code snippet, so the program continues execution without breaking out of any loop or if statement.
