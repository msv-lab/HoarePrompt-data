The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the value `m - 2`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `m - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, and `m` must be greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `m - 2` must be greater than 2 (i.e., `m` must be greater than 4).

State: **`a2` is the first integer from the second input, `l2` is a list of the remaining integers from the second input, `a1` is the first integer from the new input, `l1` is a list of the remaining integers from the new input, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the first integer from the new input, `m` must be greater than 4, `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` except those that are equal to `a2`, `l22` is a list containing all elements from `l2` except those that are equal to `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` is a list containing `m - 2` tuples, each tuple containing the first integer and the list of the remaining integers from each new input, `_` is 3, and an input has been consumed.**
