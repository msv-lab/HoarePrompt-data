The given Python code snippet is:
```
print('no')
```

### Analysis:
- The initial state specifies that `val` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`.
- The variables `a3` and `l3` are set to the values of the next tuple in `val`.
- However, the `print` statement does not use any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the string `'no'`.

### Output:
Output: **no**
