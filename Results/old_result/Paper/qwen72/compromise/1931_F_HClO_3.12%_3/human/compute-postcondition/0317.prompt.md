Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: If `m` is equal to 1, `a1` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l1` is assigned the remaining integers from the input. `n` and `m` are assigned the values from the input split by space and converted to integers. `a2` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `l2` is assigned the remaining integers from the input. `l11` is a list containing all elements from `l1` that are not equal to `a2`. `val`, `a2`, `l2`, `l22`, `i`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2` remain unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`. If `m` is not equal to 1 and `l11` is not equal to `l22`, `m` must be greater than 2, `_` is `m - 3`, `t` must be greater than `m - 3`, and the program has received user input `m - 2` times. The current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop. `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if i + max(p1, p2) == n - 1:
        break
    if l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]:
        if l1[i + p1] == a2 and l2[i + p2] == a1:
            idx1 = idx2 = i
            break
        else:
            if l1[i + p1] == a2:
                idx1 = i
                p1 = 1
            else:
                idx2 = i
                p2 = 1
            if idx1 >= 0 and idx2 >= 0:
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then: if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `idx2` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `idx2` is 0, `p2` is 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `i` remains 0 and no changes are made to `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, or `idx2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, and the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` does not equal `n - 1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `l2[i + p2]`, then: if `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` and `l2[i + p2]` is equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 1, `idx2` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `a2` but `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`, `idx1` is 0, `p1` is 1, and `l2[i + p2]` is not equal to `a1`. If `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`, `idx2` is 0, `p2` is 1, and `l1[i + p1]` is not equal to `a2`. If `idx1` is greater than or equal to 0 and `idx2` is greater than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1]` is equal to `l2[i + p2]`, `i` remains 1 and no changes are made to `p1`, `p2`, `idx1`, or `idx2`. If the sum of `i` and the maximum of `p1` and `p2` equals `n - 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]`, and `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] == a2`, and `idx1 >= 0` and `idx2 >= 0`, `idx1` is set to 2 and `p1` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `l1[i + p1] != a2`, `idx2` is set to 2 and `p2` is set to 1. If `l1[i + p1] != l2[i + p2]` and `idx1 < 0` or `idx2 < 0`, the program continues execution without any changes to `n`, `i`, `p1`, or `p2`. If `i + max(p1, p2)` equals `n - 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
