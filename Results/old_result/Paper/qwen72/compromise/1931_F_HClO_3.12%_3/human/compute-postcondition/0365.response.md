Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` must contain at least 3 tuples, `a3` is the integer from the third tuple in `val`, `l3` is the list of integers from the third tuple in `val`, `l` is a reference to either `l1` or `l2`, and `m` must be greater than 2. If `l3` is not equal to the list of integers in `l` excluding `a3`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
