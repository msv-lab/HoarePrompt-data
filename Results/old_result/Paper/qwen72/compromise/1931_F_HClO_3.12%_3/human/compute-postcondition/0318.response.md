Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is `n - 2`, `p1` is 0, `p2` is 0, `idx1` is -1, `idx2` is -1, `val` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `val`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `n` is still greater than 3, `i` is still `n - 2`, `p1` is still 0, `p2` is still 0, `idx1` is still -1, and `idx2` is still -1.
