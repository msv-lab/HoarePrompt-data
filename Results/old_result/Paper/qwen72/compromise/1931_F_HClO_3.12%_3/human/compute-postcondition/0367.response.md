Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5 for each test case, `a1`, `a2`, and `a3` are integers representing the authors of the screenshots, `l1`, `l2`, and `l3` are lists of integers representing the order of participants shown to the authors of the screenshots, `l11` and `l22` are lists containing elements from `l1` and `l2` respectively, excluding `a2` and `a1`, `i` is `n - 2`, `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`, `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, `val` contains tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, and the loop has printed 'yes' or 'no' for each test case.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- After the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` is 0 because the loop has completed all the test cases.
- The variables `n` and `m` retain their values for each test case, ensuring that the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5 are satisfied.
- The variables `a1`, `a2`, and `a3` represent the authors of the screenshots for each test case.
- The lists `l1`, `l2`, and `l3` represent the order of participants shown to the authors of the screenshots.
- The lists `l11` and `l22` are derived from `l1` and `l2` by excluding `a2` and `a1`, respectively.
- The variable `i` is set to `n - 2` after the loop has processed the participants' lists.
- The variables `idx1` and `idx2` are either both -1 or both set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and `l2[i + p2] == a1`, or one of them is set to the index where `l1[i + p1] == a2` and the other is set to the index where `l2[i + p2] == a1`.
- The variables `p1` and `p2` are either both 0 or one of them is 1, depending on the conditions encountered during the loop.
- The list `val` contains tuples of the form `(a3, l3)`, where `a3` is the author of the screenshot and `l3` is the list of participants shown to `a3`.
- For each test case, the loop has printed either 'yes' or 'no' based on whether the conditions for the lists `l1`, `l2`, and `l3` were satisfied.
