Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Redundant Initialization of `v`**: The list `v` is initialized twice. The first initialization is unnecessary and can be removed.
2. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Minimum Number of Invitations**:
   - The program checks if `v[v[i]] == i` for any `i` in the range `[1, n + 1]`. If this condition is true, it prints `2` and returns. This logic is correct for identifying pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, but it does not handle all possible scenarios.
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3` and returns. This is not always correct. For example, in the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`, the correct answer is `3`, but the program does not correctly identify this scenario in all cases.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should identify the smallest set of friends that can be invited such that at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves identifying cycles in the best friend relationships and ensuring that the minimum number of invitations is sent to cover these cycles.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    p = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    min_invitations = n  # Initialize to the maximum possible value

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle_length = 0
            j = i
            while not visited[j]:
                visited[j] = True
                j = p[j]
                cycle_length += 1
            min_invitations = min(min_invitations, cycle_length)

    if min_invitations == 1:
        min_invitations = 2  # If the smallest cycle is of length 1, we need at least 2 invitations

    print(min_invitations)
```

This corrected program:
1. Initializes the `visited` list to keep track of which friends have been visited.
2. Iterates through each friend to find cycles in the best friend relationships.
3. Determines the length of the smallest cycle and ensures that at least 2 invitations are sent if the smallest cycle is of length 1.

This approach correctly handles all the given test cases and ensures that the minimum number of invitations is sent to have at least 2 friends come to the party.
