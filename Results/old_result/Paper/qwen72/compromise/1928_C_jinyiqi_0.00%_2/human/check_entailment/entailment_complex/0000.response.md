### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining the number of natural numbers \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \) fit the described settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned follow a specific sequence: \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the results.
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the results.
   - The function `func_1(x)` returns all divisors of \( x \) in decreasing order.
   - The program then filters these divisors to find valid \( k \) values that satisfy the conditions \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.
   - It ensures that the divisors are in decreasing order by combining `output2` (divisors greater than the square root) and `output1` (divisors less than or equal to the square root).

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) to determine if the position and number fit the settling pattern.
   - It then processes the divisors returned by `func_1` to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The program uses a set to remove duplicate \( k \) values and then converts it back to a list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid.
   - It correctly processes the constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \).

6. **Output Verification**:
   - The program outputs the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values based on the given constraints and the settling pattern. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find all divisors of a number in decreasing order, and the main logic processes these divisors to find valid \( k \) values.

### Correctness:
