Output State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is a list containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` is a list containing the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in decreasing order.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `x` remains unchanged as an integer within the range 1 to 10^9. The list `output1` will contain all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and the list `output2` will contain the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in decreasing order. For example, if `x` is 12, `output1` will be `[1, 2, 3]` and `output2` will be `[12, 6, 4]`.
