Output State: **The program returns a list that combines `output2` and `output1`. `output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`, in reverse order. `output2` contains the corresponding divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, in decreasing order. The resulting list is a combination of these two lists, with `output2` followed by `output1`.**
