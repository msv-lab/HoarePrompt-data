The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of integers derived from user input, where the input is split by spaces. The function reads a line of input from the user, splits it into substrings based on spaces, converts each substring to an integer, and returns the resulting list. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers that were provided by the user.
