### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2()` reads the integers `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3()` reads the permutation `p` as a list of integers.

2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - The binary search is performed on the permutation `p` with initial values `left = 0` and `right = n`.
   - The loop continues until `left + 1 < right`, which ensures that the search space is reduced to a single element.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `left + (right - left) // 2`.
   - The element at `p[mid]` is checked against `x` to decide whether to update `left` or `right`.

3. **Swapping Logic:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `p[left]` is equal to `x`. If it is, no swaps are needed.
   - If `p[left]` is not equal to `x` and `x` has not been seen in the permutation, a single swap is performed to place `x` at the correct position.
   - If `x` has been seen but is not at the correct position, two swaps are performed to rearrange the permutation so that `x` can be found at `p[left]`.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The binary search logic is correct for a sorted array, but the permutation is not guaranteed to be sorted.
   - The program attempts to rearrange the permutation with at most 2 swaps to ensure that `x` can be found at the correct position after the binary search.
   - The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is designed to handle the cases where `x` is not at the correct position after the binary search.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `x` is already in the correct position.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not in the correct position and needs to be moved.
   - The program ensures that at most 2 swaps are performed, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to rearrange the permutation with at most 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search can find `x` at the correct position. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read the input, and the main logic handles the binary search and the necessary swaps correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
