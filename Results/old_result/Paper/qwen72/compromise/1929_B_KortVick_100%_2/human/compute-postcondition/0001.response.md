The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The state of `n` and `k` do not affect the loop's execution directly, as they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8), `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2), `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
