The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the size of the square grid, with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8. `k` is an integer representing the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, with the constraint 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2. The function returns the number of ways to color the grid such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the size of a square grid (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8) and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell (1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). It returns the number of ways to color the grid such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.**
