### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - There are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - The function then checks if \( k \) is equal to \( 4n - 2 \). If so, it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - **Case 1**: \( k = 4n - 2 \)
     - If \( k \) is equal to the total number of diagonals, then every diagonal must have at least one colored cell.
     - The minimum number of cells required to color all diagonals is \( n \) (one cell per row or column).
     - However, the function prints \( k // 2 + 1 \), which is incorrect. The correct answer should be \( n \).
   - **Case 2**: \( k < 4n - 2 \)
     - If \( k \) is less than the total number of diagonals, we need to color at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.
     - This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - The function correctly calculates and prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where \( k \) is 1 or 2 correctly.
   - For \( k = 1 \), the minimum number of cells is 1.
   - For \( k = 2 \), the minimum number of cells is 1 (since one cell can cover two diagonals).

5. **General Case**:
   - For \( k \) values between 3 and \( 4n - 3 \), the function correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed.

### Conclusion:
The function is incorrect for the case where \( k = 4n - 2 \). The correct answer should be \( n \), but the function prints \( k // 2 + 1 \).

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
