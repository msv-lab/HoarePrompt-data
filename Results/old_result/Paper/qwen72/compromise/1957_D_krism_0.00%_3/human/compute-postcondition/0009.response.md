Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 3 integers, `v` is the third integer in `arr`, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0, the first integer in `arr`, the result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` (which is the XOR of the second integer in `arr` and the last element in `prefix` before the code execution), and the new result of `v ^ prefix[-1]` (which is the XOR of the third integer in `arr` and the last element in `prefix` before the code execution).**

In natural language: The `prefix` list now contains an additional element, which is the result of the XOR operation between the third integer in `arr` (denoted as `v`) and the last element in `prefix` before the code execution. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
