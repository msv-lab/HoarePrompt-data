Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `3 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 3 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 0, `pre[j][0]` is `pre[j][0] + 1`, `suf[j][0]` is `suf[j][0] - 1`, and the least significant bit of `c` is 0.**

The value of `suf[j][0]` is decremented by 1, while all other variables and their values remain unchanged.
