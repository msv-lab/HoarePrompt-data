Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to each index.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- `arr` remains the same list of integers that was input by the user.
- `n` remains the same input integer.
- `prefix` is a list that starts with 0 and then contains the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to each index. This means that for each element in `arr`, the loop appends the result of XORing the current element with the last element in `prefix`. The final `prefix` list will have one more element than `arr`, with the first element being 0 and the subsequent elements being the cumulative XOR values.
