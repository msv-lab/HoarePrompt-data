Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 2, `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1.** 

The code snippet `suf[j][0] += 1` increments the value of `suf[j][0]` by 1. The initial state indicates that `suf[j][0]` is increased by 1, so this change is reflected in the output state. The other variables (`i`, `n`, `cur`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The condition `cur >> j & 1` is not evaluated in this snippet, so it does not affect the output state.
