The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and the step value `-1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 31 and `n` is greater than 0. Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 at each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 30, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`i` is 30, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 31**
