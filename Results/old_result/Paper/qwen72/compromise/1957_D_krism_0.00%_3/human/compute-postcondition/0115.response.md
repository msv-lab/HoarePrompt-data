The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range which is fixed at 32, so we can only adjust `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` relative to the range 32. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` is 31, `ans` is `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[1]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 1**
