Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `2 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 2 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[1]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[2]`, `j` is 31**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `arr[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 3, `i - 1` is 2, so `y` is now equal to `arr[2]`.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `ans`, `k`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged.
