Output State: **`i` is 30, `n` is greater than 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[30]`, `j` is 31**  

The code snippet `cur = prefix[i]` assigns the value of `prefix[30]` to `cur`. The values of `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional confirmation that `cur` is now equal to `prefix[30]`.
