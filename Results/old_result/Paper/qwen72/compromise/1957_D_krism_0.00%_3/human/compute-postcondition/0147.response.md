The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and the range `32`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` being less than 32. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 to 2, and the range `32` remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is 31, `ans` is `3 * pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + 3 * pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`, `y` is equal to `arr[2]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[2]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[3]`, `j` is 2**
