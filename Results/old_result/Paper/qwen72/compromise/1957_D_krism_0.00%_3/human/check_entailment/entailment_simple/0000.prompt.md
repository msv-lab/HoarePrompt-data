Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

# Annotated Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array and the number of test cases. A revised function definition would look like: `def count_tuples(t, arrays):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `arrays` is a list of lists, each containing integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= a_i <= 10^9`.
def func_1():
    print('-----------------')

    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is an input integer, `prefix` is a list containing the integers 0 and the cumulative XOR of the elements in `arr` up to each index.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: - The output will be the list `arr` followed by the list `prefix`.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:
    #
    #Output:
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: `i` is 31, the range is 32, `pre[0][0]` is increased by 1, `pre[1][0]` is increased by 1, ..., `pre[31][0]` is increased by 1.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):

            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: After the loop executes all the iterations, `i` is 0, `n` is 31, and for each bit position `j` from 0 to 31, if the bit at position `j` in `prefix[i]` is 1, `suf[j][1]` is incremented by the number of times that bit is 1 across all `prefix` values from `prefix[31]` to `prefix[1]`. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by the number of times that bit is 0 across all `prefix` values from `prefix[31]` to `prefix[1]`.
    print(pre)
    #This is printed: pre (where pre is an unknown variable not described in the initial state)
    print(suf)
    #This is printed: [[suf[0][0], suf[0][1]], [suf[1][0], suf[1][1]], ..., [suf[31][0], suf[31][1]]] (where suf[j][0] is the count of 0s at bit position j across prefix[31] to prefix[1] if the bit at position j in prefix[0] is 0, and suf[j][1] is the count of 1s at bit position j across prefix[31] to prefix[1] if the bit at position j in prefix[0] is 1)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1

            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: `i` is 31, `n` is 31, `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each `k` from 0 to 31, where `k` is the bit length of each `arr[i]` minus 1 for `i` from 0 to 30. `y` is equal to `arr[30]`, `k` is the bit length of `arr[30]` minus 1, `c` is `prefix[31]`, `j` is 31. For each bit position `j` from 0 to 31 in `c` (which is `prefix[31]`), if the bit at position `j` is 1, then `pre[j][1]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][1]` is decreased by 1. If the bit at position `j` is 0, then `pre[j][0]` is increased by 1 and `suf[j][0]` is decreased by 1.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for each k from 0 to 31, after adjusting pre and suf based on the bits of prefix[31])
