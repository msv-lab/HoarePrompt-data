You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` integers. It computes the cumulative XOR of the elements in the list and stores these values in a list `prefix`. It then initializes two lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists with two elements (0 and 0). The function increments the first element of each sublist in `pre` by 1. For each element in `prefix` (excluding the first element), the function updates the `suf` list based on the bit positions of the current element. It calculates a final result `ans` by summing up specific products derived from the `pre` and `suf` lists, and prints this result. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`.
   - This is done correctly by iterating through `arr` and updating `prefix` with the cumulative XOR.

3. **Initialization of `pre` and `suf` Arrays**:
   - The program initializes two 2D arrays `pre` and `suf` with dimensions 32x2 (32 bits for each integer).
   - `pre` is initialized such that `pre[i][0]` is set to 1 for all `i` from 0 to 31. This is incorrect because `pre` should be initialized to count the number of prefix XOR values with a specific bit set or unset, starting from 0.

4. **Updating `suf` Array**:
   - The program updates the `suf` array by iterating from `n` to 1 and counting the number of suffix XOR values with each bit set or unset.
   - This is done correctly by iterating through the bits of the current prefix XOR value and updating the counts in `suf`.

5. **Counting Valid Tuples**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` by iterating through the array and using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
   - However, the logic for counting valid tuples is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the number of valid tuples can be determined by the product of counts of specific bit patterns in `pre` and `suf`.

6. **Updating `pre` and `suf` Arrays During Tuple Counting**:
   - The program updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays during the tuple counting process, which is necessary to maintain the correct counts of prefix and suffix XOR values.
   - However, the updates are not correctly aligned with the logic for counting valid tuples.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation of Flaws:
- **Initialization of `pre`**:
  - The initialization of `pre` is incorrect. `pre[i][0]` should not be set to 1 for all `i` from 0 to 31. Instead, it should be initialized to count the number of prefix XOR values with each bit set or unset, starting from 0.

- **Logic for Counting Valid Tuples**:
  - The logic for counting valid tuples is flawed. The condition `f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)` is not correctly checked. The program incorrectly assumes that the product of counts of specific bit patterns in `pre` and `suf` can determine the number of valid tuples, which is not the case.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Calculate the prefix XOR array.
2. Use a more sophisticated method to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` that satisfy the condition `f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.
3. This can be done by iterating through all possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z` and checking the condition directly, or by using a more efficient approach such as segment trees or binary indexed trees to count the valid tuples.

Given the flaws in the current logic, the program is incorrect.
