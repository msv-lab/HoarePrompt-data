The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it is expected to take input through a predefined method or variable, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains four pairs of integers (x_i, y_i) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each coordinate x_i and y_i is an integer such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. It is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

The function returns the area of the square for each test case.

Functionality: **The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns the area of the square for each test case.**
