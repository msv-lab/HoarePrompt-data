t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. test_cases is a list of t elements, where each element is a list of 4 tuples, and each tuple contains two integers (x_i, y_i) (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000) representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It is guaranteed that the coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and with a positive area.
