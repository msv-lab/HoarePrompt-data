The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself and starts at 0. The state of the list of test cases does not affect the loop's execution directly, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
