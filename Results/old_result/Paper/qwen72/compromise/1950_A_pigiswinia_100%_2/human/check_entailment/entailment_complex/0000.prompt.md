Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) â€” the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list or tuple of three digits a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases t should be a non-negative integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be overwritten in each iteration, and the loop variable `i` will increment from 0 to `t-1`. After the loop finishes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values read in the last iteration, and `i` will be equal to `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (where `0 <= a, b, c <= 9`) from the input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program includes the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` from the last test case, and the loop variable `i` will be equal to `t-1`.
