You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a list or tuple of three digits a, b, and c such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases t should be a non-negative integer where 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will print 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be overwritten in each iteration, and the loop variable `i` will increment from 0 to `t-1`. After the loop finishes, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values read in the last iteration, and `i` will be equal to `t`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled using `t = int(input())`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that iterates `t` times, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases.

3. **Reading Digits**: Inside the loop, the program reads three space-separated integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`. This is the correct way to read three integers from a single line of input.

4. **Stair Condition**: The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correct according to the problem description.

5. **Peak Condition**: The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correct according to the problem description.

6. **Default Case**: If neither the stair nor the peak condition is met, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct default case as per the problem description.

7. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the expected behavior.

Given that the program correctly handles the input, processes the conditions, and produces the correct output for each test case, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
