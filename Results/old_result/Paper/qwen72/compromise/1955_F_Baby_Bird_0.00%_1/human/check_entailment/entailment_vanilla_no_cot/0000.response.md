Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. Let's break down the logic to understand why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading four integers (the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s).

2. **Bitwise XOR Analysis**:
   - The bitwise XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the counts of numbers with each bit set are even.
   - For numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, their binary representations are:
     - 1: 0001
     - 2: 0010
     - 3: 0011
     - 4: 0100
   - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the counts of these numbers determines the XOR result. Specifically, the XOR of the sequence will be zero if the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are all even.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy**:
   - Eve wants to maximize the number of times Bob wins. Bob wins when the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero.
   - The program calculates the number of times Bob can win by:
     - Checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, Bob wins once before any removals.
     - Then, it calculates the total number of pairs that can be removed to make the XOR zero. This is done by summing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s and dividing by 2 (since each pair of numbers can be removed to maintain an even count).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum number of times Bob can win for each test case.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem requirements, and the program should produce the correct output for the given examples and other valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
