### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) and the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. Alice wins otherwise.
   - The sequence is initially given by the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero.
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself.
   - The XOR of an even number of 1s is zero, and the XOR of an odd number of 1s is 1.
   - The XOR of an even number of 3s is zero, and the XOR of an odd number of 3s is 3.
   - The XOR of any number of 2s or 4s is zero because 2 and 4 are even numbers.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining sequence zero as often as possible.
   - This can be achieved by removing numbers in such a way that the parity (odd/even count) of the numbers that affect the XOR (1s and 3s) is managed optimally.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s into a list `p`.
   - The line `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))` effectively sets all elements in `p` to their nearest even number (i.e., it rounds down to the nearest even number). This means it converts all odd counts to even counts.
   - The line `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)` calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.
     - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` checks if the first three elements of `p` (which are the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s) are all odd. If they are, it adds 1 to the result.
     - `sum(p) // 2` calculates the total number of pairs of numbers that can be removed, which is half the sum of all counts (rounded down).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the conversion of counts to their nearest even numbers, which is a key part of the optimal removal strategy.
   - The condition `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3` ensures that if all three counts (1s, 2s, and 3s) are odd, Bob wins once more.
   - The final result `sum(p) // 2` correctly calculates the number of pairs that can be removed, which is the maximum number of times Bob can win.
