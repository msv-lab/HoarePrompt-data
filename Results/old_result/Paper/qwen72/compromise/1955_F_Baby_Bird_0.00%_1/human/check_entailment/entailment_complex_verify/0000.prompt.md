You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is an integer that is the sum of the number of odd integers in the first three elements of the list `p` (which can only be 0 or 3) and half the sum of all elements in the list `p` (rounded down). The initial state of `t` and the lists `p_i` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of four integers from the input, modifies each integer to be even, and then calculates and prints an integer that is the sum of the number of odd integers in the first three elements of the modified list (which can only be 0 or 3) and half the sum of all elements in the modified list (rounded down). The function does not return any value, and the initial state of the input variables remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic used to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win is flawed. The program subtracts the remainder of the division by 2 from each of the input values, which effectively rounds down each value to the nearest even number. This approach does not correctly account for the bitwise XOR properties and the optimal removal strategy for Eve.

A correct approach should consider the following:
1. The XOR of all numbers in the sequence.
2. The optimal removal of numbers to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

The program fails to correctly handle the following case:
- Input: `1 1 1 1`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: `1`

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the number of times Bob can win. The correct logic should consider the parity of the counts of each number and the effect of removing each type of number on the XOR result.
