Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `obj` of two integers representing coordinates and a string `d` representing a direction ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). It modifies the coordinates in `obj` based on the direction: if `d` is 'U', the first integer is decreased by 1; if `d` is 'D', the first integer is increased by 1; if `d` is 'L', the second integer is decreased by 1; if `d` is 'R', the second integer is increased by 1. If `d` is not one of these directions, `obj` remains unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
