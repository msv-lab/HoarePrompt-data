### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program is designed to simulate a simplified version of a Quidditch match, where players from two teams (Red and Blue) compete to score goals by moving and throwing the Quaffle. A Bludger can eliminate players if they are in the same cell.
   - The field is represented as a grid, and the actions are performed step by step.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(obj, d)`**
   - This function updates the position of an entity (player, Quaffle, or Bludger) based on the direction `d` (U, D, L, R).
   - The function correctly modifies the position of the entity by adjusting the row and column indices.
   - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(t)`**
   - This function checks if any player is in the same cell as the Bludger and prints the elimination event.
   - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players whose positions match the Bludger's position.
   - It then updates the position of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` to indicate they are out of the game.
   - The function sorts the list of eliminated players and prints the elimination events in the required format.
   - The function is correct and does what it is supposed to do.

4. **Overall Program Structure:**
   - The program is expected to handle the following:
     - Reading the initial field configuration.
     - Processing the actions step by step.
     - Handling player movements, ball catching, and throwing.
     - Checking for goal scoring and player eliminations.
     - Printing the events and the final score.
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are part of the overall program and are responsible for player movements and eliminations, respectively.
   - The functions are correctly implemented and should work as expected.

5. **Missing Parts:**
   - The provided code snippets are incomplete. They do not include the main logic for reading the input, processing the actions, and handling goal scoring.
   - However, based on the functions provided, they appear to be correct and would work as part of a complete program.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The functions handle the basic movements and eliminations correctly.
   - They do not handle the Quaffle's movement or goal scoring, but these are not part of the provided functions.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided functions, they are correct and would work as part of a complete program. However, the full program is not provided, so we cannot determine the correctness of the entire solution. Based on the functions alone:

Correctness: **True**
