Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and does not fully address the problem description. Here are the issues:

1. **Incomplete Implementation**: The program only includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are not sufficient to handle the entire game logic as described. The program is missing the main logic to process the game steps, handle scoring, and print the final score.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to move an entity (player or ball) based on the direction given. However, it does not handle the movement of the Quaffle when it is thrown or the movement of the Bludger. It also does not check if the movement is valid (e.g., staying within the field boundaries).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` is used to check if any player is eliminated by the Bludger. It correctly identifies and prints the eliminated players, but it does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. Additionally, it does not update the field state to reflect the elimination of the player.

4. **Missing Main Game Logic**:
   - The program does not include the main game loop to process each step of the game.
   - It does not handle the scoring logic, including checking if a player has scored in the correct or incorrect goal.
   - It does not handle the movement of the Quaffle back to the center of the field after a goal is scored.
   - It does not print the events in the correct format and order as specified in the problem description.
   - It does not print the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Data Structures**:
   - The program does not define the necessary data structures to keep track of the players, goals, Quaffle, and Bludger positions.
   - It does not define the initial state of the field based on the input.

To be considered correct, the program should include all the necessary functions and logic to handle the game steps, scoring, and player eliminations as described in the problem statement. The provided code is a good start but is far from a complete solution.
