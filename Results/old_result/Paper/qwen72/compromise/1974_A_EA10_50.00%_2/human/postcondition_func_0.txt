The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. It then calculates a value `z` based on the formula `(y + 1) // 2` and adjusts `z` if a condition involving `m` (calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`) is met. The function prints the value of `z` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.
