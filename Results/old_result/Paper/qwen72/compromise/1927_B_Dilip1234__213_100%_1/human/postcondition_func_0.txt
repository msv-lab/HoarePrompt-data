The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies `0 â‰¤ a_i < n`. It returns a string `s` of length `n` composed of characters from 'a' to 'z'. The characters in `s` are determined such that for each integer `a_i` in the list `a`, the function appends the first character from 'a' to 'z' whose current count in `s` matches `a_i`. The final string `s` will have the characters distributed according to the values in `a`.
