n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for the given trace, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
