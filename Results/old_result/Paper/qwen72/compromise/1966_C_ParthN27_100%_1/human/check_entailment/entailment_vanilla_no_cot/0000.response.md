Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the winner. The program attempts to check if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1, but this is not the correct approach to determine the winner of the game.

### Explanation:
1. **Game Analysis**:
   - The game is a variant of the Nim game where the number of stones removed from each non-empty pile is the same.
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is a Nim game with a twist. The optimal strategy involves checking the parity (odd or even) of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, count the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
   - If this count is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.

3. **Issues in the Provided Program**:
   - The program sorts the unique pile sizes and checks if the differences between consecutive sizes are all 1. This is not relevant to the game's outcome.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the game is won based on the sequence of unique pile sizes, which is not the case.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = sum(1 for x in arr if x % 2 == 1)
        if odd_count % 2 == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **odd_count**: This variable counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
- **if odd_count % 2 == 1**: If the count of odd piles is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

This approach correctly determines the winner based on the game's rules and the optimal strategy.
