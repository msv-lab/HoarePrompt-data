Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case. It also reads the constraints (a, x) and processes them accordingly.

2. **Constraint Types**:
   - **Type 1 (a == 1)**: The program updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound for `k`.
   - **Type 2 (a == 2)**: The program updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound for `k`.
   - **Type 3 (a == 3)**: The program adds `x` to the set `cx`. This set contains all the integers that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - The program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If it is, then there is no valid integer `k` that can satisfy both the lower and upper bounds, and the result for that test case is 0.
   - If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, the program calculates the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that are not in the set `cx`. It does this by iterating over the set `cx` and counting how many of these values fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly appends the result for each test case to the list `r` and prints each result on a new line.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `bx` is greater than `ax` correctly by appending 0 to the result list.
   - The program also handles the case where there are no constraints of type 3 correctly by simply calculating the range `[bx, ax]`.

6. **Optimizations**:
   - The use of a set `cx` for constraints of type 3 is efficient for checking membership.
   - The initial values for `ax` and `bx` are set to `1000000000 + 7` and `-1` respectively, which are appropriate for the problem constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
