Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than the previous value of `n - 1`. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` contains the integer 0. If `bx` â‰¤ `ax`, `r` contains the integer `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. Otherwise, `cx` contains the integer `x` and `a` is not equal to 1 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1 if `a` is 1, otherwise `bx` is -1. If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of the updated `x` and the previous `bx`. `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 1. If `a` is 2, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is either an empty set or a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007 or the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1 unless `a` is 1, in which case `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous `bx`. `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `n` must be greater than 0. If `a` is 1, `bx` is updated to the maximum of the updated `x` and the previous `bx`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the previous `ax`. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
