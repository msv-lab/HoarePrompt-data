Postcondition: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers. `cx` is a set containing all the integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2. `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2, or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered. `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` was encountered. The current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`.**
