Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and will be automatically managed by the loop, `n` is an input integer, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    a, x = map(int, input().split())
    if a == 1:
        bx = max(x, bx)
    elif a == 2:
        ax = min(x, ax)
    else:
        cx.add(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set, and `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 1, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `bx` remains -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `bx` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `bx` remains -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `bx` remains -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers. If `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 2, otherwise `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`. `ax` is 1000000007 if `a` is not 2, otherwise `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. `bx` is the maximum of `x` and the previous value of `bx`. If `a` is 2, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the previous value of `ax`, and `bx` remains -1. If `a` is not 1 or 2, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` remains -1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
