To determine what will be printed by the `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement, we need to carefully analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` and `n` are integers greater than 0.
   - `a` and `x` are input integers.
   - `cx` is a set containing all unique integers `x` for which `a` was 3 across all test cases.
   - `ax` is the minimum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 2 across all test cases, or 1000000007 if no such `x` exists.
   - `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1 across all test cases, or -1 if no such `x` exists.
   - `r` is a list that now contains `t` integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case.

2. **Conditions for Each Test Case**:
   - If `bx` > `ax`, the result is 0.
   - If `bx` ≤ `ax`, the result is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) for that test case.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The list `r` contains `t` integers, each calculated based on the conditions above.
   - Each element in `r` is determined by comparing `bx` and `ax` and then applying the appropriate formula.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be a series of integers, each representing the result of the corresponding test case. The exact values of these integers depend on the values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` for each test case.

Output: **Each element of the list `r` on a new line, where each element is calculated as follows:**
- If `bx` > `ax`, the element is 0.
- If `bx` ≤ `ax`, the element is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) for that test case.

This output will be a sequence of integers, one per line, corresponding to the results of each test case.
