Postcondition: ***`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing all the integers `x` for which `a` was not 1 or 2, `ax` is the minimum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 2 or 1000000007 if no such `x` was encountered, `bx` is the maximum of all the integers `x` for which `a` was 1 or -1 if no such `x` was encountered. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` is a list containing the integer 0. If `bx` â‰¤ `ax`, `tmp` is the count of integers in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` is a list that now includes the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.***
