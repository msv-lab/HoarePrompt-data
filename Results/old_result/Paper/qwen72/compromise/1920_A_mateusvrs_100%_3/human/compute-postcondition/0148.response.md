The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided context, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a set of constraints. The constraints for each test case are defined by an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) and pairs (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer (1 <= x <= 10^9). The function is expected to process these constraints and return a result for each test case. Given the constraints, the function should handle the input and produce the appropriate output for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a number of constraints `n` and pairs (a, x). It returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided.**
