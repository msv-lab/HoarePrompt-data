Output State: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all integers `x` for which `a` was 1, or -1 if no such `x` exists, `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, `_` is `n`, `n` is an input integer greater than the previous value of `n - 1`. If `bx` > `ax`, `r` contains the integer 0. If `bx` â‰¤ `ax`, `r` contains the integer `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, and `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive).**

Explanation:
- The value of `ax` is updated to 1000000007.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `cx`, `bx`, `r`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
