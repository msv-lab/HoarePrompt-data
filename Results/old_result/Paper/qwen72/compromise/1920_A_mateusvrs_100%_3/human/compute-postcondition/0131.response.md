Postcondition: **`t` and `n` are integers greater than 0, `a` and `x` are input integers, `cx` is a set containing the integers that were added to it during the loop, `ax` is the minimum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 2 or 1000000007, `bx` is the maximum of all the `x` values encountered when `a` was 1 or -1. `r` is a list that contains the integer 0 or `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` depending on the conditions, where `tmp` is the count of unique integers in `cx` that are between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive). `n` must be greater than 0, and `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`.**
