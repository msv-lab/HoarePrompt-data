Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the handling of the `day` variable, which determines whether the time is in the AM or PM. The program incorrectly sets `day` to 'PM' for hours 1 through 11, and it also incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' for 12 PM. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        (h, m) = map(int, input().split(':'))
        day = 'AM'
        if h >= 12:
            day = 'PM'
        if h > 12:
            h = h - 12
        elif h == 0:
            h = 12
        print(f'{h:02d}:{m:02d}', day)
```

### Explanation of the corrections:
1. **Initialization of `day`**: The `day` variable should be initialized to 'AM' at the start of each test case, not outside the loop.
2. **Setting `day` to 'PM'**: The condition to set `day` to 'PM' should be `if h >= 12`, not `else: day = 'PM'`.
3. **Adjusting the hour for PM**: If the hour is greater than 12, it should be adjusted by subtracting 12.
4. **Handling 00 hour**: If the hour is 00, it should be set to 12 and the `day` should be 'AM'.

This corrected version will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
