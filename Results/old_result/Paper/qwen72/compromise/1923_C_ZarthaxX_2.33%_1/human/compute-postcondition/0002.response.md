Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers, `n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.** 

The array `c` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is also a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5). Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
