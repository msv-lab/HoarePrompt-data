You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries `q`. The array `c` has a length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), and each element `c_i` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). The number of queries `q` is also a positive integer (1 ≤ q ≤ 3 · 10^5). Each query consists of two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the start and end indices of a subarray of `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the count of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to `i-1`. `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1` and 1.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `ones` and `sum` remain unchanged, and the loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries `q`. For each query, it returns the result of processing the subarray of `c` defined by the start and end indices `l_i` and `r_i`. The exact nature of the processing is not specified, but it is assumed to be consistent across all queries. If the input parameters do not meet the specified constraints, the function's behavior is undefined.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
