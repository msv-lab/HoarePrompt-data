Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct based on the problem description. Here's a step-by-step explanation of why:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `testCases`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It reads the array `nums` of length `n`.
   - It initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`:
     - `ones[i]` stores the cumulative count of 1s up to index `i-1` in `nums`.
     - `sum[i]` stores the cumulative sum of `nums[i-1] - 1` up to index `i-1`.

3. **Cumulative Arrays Calculation**:
   - For each element in `nums`, it updates the `ones` and `sum` arrays:
     - `ones[i]` is updated to `ones[i-1] + 1` if `nums[i-1]` is 1, otherwise it remains `ones[i-1]`.
     - `sum[i]` is updated to `sum[i-1] + nums[i-1] - 1`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it reads the subarray boundaries `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, it prints 'NO' because a single-element subarray cannot be good (it cannot be transformed to a different positive integer).
   - Otherwise, it calculates:
     - `onesInRange` as the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l-1]` to `c[r-1]`.
     - `sumInRange` as the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for `i` in the range `[l-1, r-1]`.
   - It checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` holds. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray can be distributed such that each element is different from the original and positive.

5. **Condition Explanation**:
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.
   - This means that the number of 1s plus the number of elements in the subarray should be less than or equal to the sum of the subarray minus the number of elements. This ensures that there is enough "slack" in the sum to transform each element to a different positive integer.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good and handles all edge cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
