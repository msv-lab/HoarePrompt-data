### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, the length of the array `c`, the array `c` itself, and the queries.
   - The use of `map(int, input().split(' '))` ensures that the input is parsed correctly into integers.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays:**
   - The `ones` array is used to keep track of the cumulative count of 1s in the array `c` up to each index.
   - The `sum` array is used to keep track of the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `c` and 1. This is useful for determining if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" array.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` is good.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray is a single element, and it cannot be transformed into a "good" array because there is no other element to satisfy the condition `a_i â‰  b_i`.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is used to determine if the subarray is good. This condition checks if the sum of the differences in the subarray is sufficient to allow for a transformation where all elements are different and positive.

4. **Condition Explanation:**
   - `onesInRange` is the count of 1s in the subarray from `l` to `r`.
   - `sumInRange` is the sum of the differences between each element in the subarray and 1.
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `(r - l + 1) + onesInRange <= sumInRange`. This checks if the total number of elements in the subarray plus the number of 1s is less than or equal to the sum of the differences. This ensures that there are enough "slack" values to transform the subarray into a "good" array.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query, which matches the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The auxiliary arrays are used efficiently to handle the queries, and the conditions are checked accurately.

**Correctness: True**
