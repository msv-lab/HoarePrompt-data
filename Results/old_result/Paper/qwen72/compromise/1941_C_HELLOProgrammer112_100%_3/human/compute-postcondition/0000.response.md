The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0. Since the function is supposed to take an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `t` is provided and is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
