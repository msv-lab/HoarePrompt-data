The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of tuples. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and it must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each tuple in the list contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` must be within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. For each test case, the result is a string that indicates some property or computation based on the input `n` and `s`.
