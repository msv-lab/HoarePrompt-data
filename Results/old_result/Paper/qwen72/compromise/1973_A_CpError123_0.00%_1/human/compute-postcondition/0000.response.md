Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 where 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `resultats` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `resultats`. The values of `t` and `cas_de_test` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions for `t` and `cas_de_test`, along with the new state of `resultats` being an empty list.
