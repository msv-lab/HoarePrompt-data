The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from the standard input. The first line of input contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` with the constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The next `n` lines each contain `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, where the first and last columns of each row are always 0 (i.e., a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n).

The function processes this input and returns a result based on the given constraints and the depths of the river cells. However, the specific output is not provided in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, including four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` and a grid of `n` rows and `m` columns representing river depths. It returns a result based on the input, but the exact nature of the result is not specified in the problem statement.**
