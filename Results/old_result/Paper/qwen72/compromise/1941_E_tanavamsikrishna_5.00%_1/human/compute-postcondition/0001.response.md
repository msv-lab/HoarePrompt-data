Output State: **The first line of input contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. These integers are assigned to `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` respectively. The next `n` lines each contain `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, where `a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The variable `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells.**
