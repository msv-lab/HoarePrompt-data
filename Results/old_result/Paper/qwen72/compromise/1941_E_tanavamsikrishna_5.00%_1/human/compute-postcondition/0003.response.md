Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are unchanged; `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells; `costs` is a list of length `n`, where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for the corresponding row in `rows`; `total_costs` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `total_costs`, while the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
