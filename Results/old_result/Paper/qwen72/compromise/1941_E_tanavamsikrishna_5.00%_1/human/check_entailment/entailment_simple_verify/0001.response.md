### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a grid representing a river with `n` rows and `m` columns.
   - Each cell `(i, j)` has a depth `a_{i, j}`.
   - Rudolf needs to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of the chosen row.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to each cell's depth.
   - For the remaining cells, it calculates the cost by adding 1 to the cell's depth and the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell).
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell in the row.

   **Annotations Analysis:**
   - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements by 1, which is correct because these cells are within the distance constraint from the first column.
   - The second loop updates the cost for each cell from `d-1` to the end of the row. It uses the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells (excluding the current cell) plus the current cell's depth plus 1. This ensures that the distance constraint is respected and the cost is minimized.
   - The function returns the last element of the row, which is the total cost for the row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths for `n` rows.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these total costs.

   **Annotations Analysis:**
   - The input is read correctly and split into integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The `costs` list is populated by calling `func_1` for each row, which is correct.
   - The `total_costs` list is populated by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - The minimum of the `total_costs` list is printed, which is the correct output for the test case.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, such as the number of rows and columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance.
   - The function ensures that supports are installed in the first and last columns of each row.
   - The function correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row and the total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

5. **Algorithmic Correctness:**
   - The algorithm used in `func_1` is a dynamic programming approach that ensures the minimum cost for installing supports while respecting the distance constraint `d`.
   - The algorithm in `func_2` correctly iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, respects the constraints, and uses an appropriate dynamic programming approach to minimize the total cost of installing supports.

**Final: True**
