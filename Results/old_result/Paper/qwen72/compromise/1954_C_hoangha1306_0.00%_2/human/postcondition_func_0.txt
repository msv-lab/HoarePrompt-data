The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from the input, where each string consists of digits from 1 to 9. The function then generates two strings `kq1` and `kq2` of the same length as `a` and `b`. For each character position `i` in `a` and `b`, if the characters are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` will have the same character at position `i`. If the characters are different, the first differing character in `kq1` and `kq2` will be the smaller and larger of the two characters, respectively, and subsequent differing characters will be swapped. The function prints `kq1` and `kq2` for each test case. The function does not return any value.
