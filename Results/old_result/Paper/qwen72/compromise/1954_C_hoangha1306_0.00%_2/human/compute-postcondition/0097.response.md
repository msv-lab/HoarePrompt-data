Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 2, `i` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `y` is the maximum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `kq1` includes the string representation of `y` appended to its previous value, `kq2` includes the string representation of `x` appended to its previous value, `vt` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `kq2 = kq2 + str(x)` appends the string representation of `x` to `kq2`.
- `x` is the minimum of the second characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
