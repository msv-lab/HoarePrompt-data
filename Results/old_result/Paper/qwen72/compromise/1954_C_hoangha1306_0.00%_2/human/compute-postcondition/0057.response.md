Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 3 characters; `i` is 2. If `a[2]` is equal to `b[2]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both concatenated with the third character of `a`. If `a[2]` is not equal to `b[2]`, `x` is the smaller integer represented by the third character of `a` or `b`, and `y` is the larger integer represented by the third character of `a` or `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` and `kq2` remain unchanged. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is updated to `kq1 + str(y)` and `kq2` is updated to `kq2 + str(x)`.**
