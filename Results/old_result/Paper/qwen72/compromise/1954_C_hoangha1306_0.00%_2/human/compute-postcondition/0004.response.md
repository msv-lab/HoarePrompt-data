Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` is an input string; `b` is an input string; `kq1` is an empty string.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the variable `kq1`, which is now an empty string.
