Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length of at least 1, `i` is 0, `kq1` and `kq2` are updated based on the first characters of `a` and `b`. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`, and `vt` remains 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, `y` is the maximum of the first characters of `a` and `b` converted to integers, and `kq1` and `kq2` are set based on the comparison of the first characters of `a` and `b`: if the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`; otherwise, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.**
