Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 2 characters; `kq1` is the original `kq1` string concatenated with the string representation of `y`; `kq2` is a string; `i` is 1; `x` is the smaller of the integers represented by the second character of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger of the integers represented by the second character of `a` and `b`; `vt` is 1.**
