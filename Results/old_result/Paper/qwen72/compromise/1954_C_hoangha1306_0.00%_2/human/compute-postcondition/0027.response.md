Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with at least one character; `kq1` and `kq2` are strings; `i` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` each contain the first character of `a`, and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are different, `x` is the minimum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, `y` is the maximum of `int(a[0])` and `int(b[0])`, and `vt` is 1 if it was initially 0. If the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b` and `vt` was initially 0, `kq1` contains the string representation of `x` and `kq2` contains the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, if `vt` was initially 0, `kq1` contains the string representation of `y` and `kq2` contains the string representation of `x`. If `vt` was not initially 0, `kq1` contains the string representation of `y` and `kq2` contains the string representation of `x`.**
