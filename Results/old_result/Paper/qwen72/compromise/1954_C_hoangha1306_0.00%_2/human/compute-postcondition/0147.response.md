Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is 0, and `vt` is 0. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are the same, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If the first characters of `a` and `b` are not the same, `x` is the smaller of the first digits of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the first digits of `a` and `b`, and `vt` is set to 1. `kq1` is set to the string representation of the smaller digit, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of the larger digit. If `vt` was already 1 before the if-else block, `kq1` is set to the string representation of the larger digit, and `kq2` is set to the string representation of the smaller digit.***
