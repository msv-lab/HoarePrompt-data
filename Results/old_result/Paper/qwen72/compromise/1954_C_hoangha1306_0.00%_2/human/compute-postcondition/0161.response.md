Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` is an input string, `b` is a new input string with the same length as `a`, `i` is 1, `x` is the smaller of the second digits of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger of the second digits of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is a string that includes the previous value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is a string that includes the previous value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string that includes the digit `y` appended to its previous value, and `kq2` is a string that now includes the digit `x` appended to its previous value.***
