Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer, x and y are integers for each test case where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                if a[i] > b[i]:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
                else:
                    kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                    kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9; `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length; `i` is `len(a) - 1`. `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that have been constructed by comparing each corresponding character of `a` and `b`. For each character position, if the characters are the same, both `kq1` and `kq2` are concatenated with that character. If the characters are different, `kq1` is concatenated with the larger of the two characters (or the smaller one if `vt` was initially 0 and the first differing character in `a` was less than the corresponding character in `b`), and `kq2` is concatenated with the smaller of the two characters (or the larger one if `vt` was initially 0 and the first differing character in `a` was less than the corresponding character in `b`). `vt` is 1 if there was at least one position where the characters in `a` and `b` differed and `vt` was initially 0, otherwise `vt` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 1, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of the same length as `a` and `b`, and `vt` is 1 if there was at least one position where `a[i]` and `b[i]` were different, otherwise `vt` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `q` is 2, `x` and `y` are integers where 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and x and y consist only of digits from 1 to 9, `a` and `b` are input strings with the same length, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `vt` is 0 or 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings of the same length as `a` and `b` where each character is determined by the rules specified in the loop. If `a[i]` == `b[i]` for any `i`, the corresponding character in `kq1` and `kq2` is `a[i]`. If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, the corresponding character in `kq1` and `kq2` is either the smaller or larger of `a[i]` and `b[i]` based on the value of `vt` and the conditions in the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
