Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input. It first reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array. Then, it reads a line of space-separated integers, splits it into a list of strings, and appends each string to the list `a`. However, the elements of `a` are stored as strings, not integers. This is a critical issue because the MEX operation and the sum calculation require integer values.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the length of the array `a` as an argument. This is incorrect because `func_1` should be called with the list `a` itself, not its length.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `c` as an argument, which is the length of the array `a`.
   - It initializes a variable `m` to 0, which is not used in the function.
   - The function checks if `c` (the length of the array) is equal to 2.
     - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`, which is the correct output for an array of length 2 with elements `[0, 1]` as shown in the first example.
     - If `c` is not 2, it prints `13 0`, which is the correct output for an array of length 3 with elements `[1, 3, 9]` as shown in the second example.
   - The function then returns, but the return value is not used.

4. **Output**:
   - For the first example with `n = 2` and `a = [0, 1]`, the program correctly outputs `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - For the second example with `n = 3` and `a = [1, 3, 9]`, the program correctly outputs `13 0`.
   - However, the program does not handle other cases correctly. For example, it does not handle the third example with `n = 4` and `a = [1, 100, 2, 1]` or the fourth example with `n = 1` and `a = [0]`.

5. **General Case**:
   - The program only handles the specific cases where the length of the array is 2 or 3. It does not provide a general solution for arrays of other lengths.
   - The function `func_1` does not compute the MEX of any subarray or perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the array elements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is not correct for the general case. It only works for specific lengths of the array (2 and 3) and does not handle other lengths or different array contents.
   - The program also has issues with input handling, as it stores the array elements as strings instead of integers.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect for the general case and has issues with input handling.

Final: **False**
