Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input array `a` as a list of strings and does not convert these strings to integers. This will cause issues when trying to perform operations on the array elements, as they are not in the correct numeric format.

2. **Function Argument Mismatch**: The function `func_1` is called with `len(a)` as its argument, but the function expects a list `c` as its argument. The length of the list `a` is passed instead of the list itself, which means the function will not have access to the actual array elements.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_1` only handles two specific cases:
   - If the length of the list `c` is 2, it prints "4 1" followed by "1 2".
   - Otherwise, it prints "13 0".
   This logic is not correct for the problem description, which requires maximizing the sum of the array elements by performing the MEX operation. The function does not compute the MEX or perform any operations on the array to maximize the sum.

4. **No General Solution**: The function does not provide a general solution for any input array. It only handles two specific lengths (2 and not 2) and does not consider the actual values in the array.

5. **Output Format**: The function prints the output directly, which is not a problem in itself, but it does not follow the correct logic to determine the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

Given these issues, the program does not solve the problem as described and is therefore incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
