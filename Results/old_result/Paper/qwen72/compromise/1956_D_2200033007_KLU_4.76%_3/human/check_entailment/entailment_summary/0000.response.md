Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the input and stores it in a list `a` but does not convert the elements from strings to integers. This will cause issues when performing operations that require integer arithmetic or comparisons.

2. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with the length of the array `a` as an argument, but the function itself does not use this argument in a meaningful way. The function only checks if the length is 2 and prints a fixed output regardless of the actual values in the array.

3. **Output Logic**: The function `func_1` prints a fixed output of "4 1" and "1 2" if the length of the array is 2, and "13 0" otherwise. This does not solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing the MEX operation, and the output should reflect the maximum sum and the sequence of operations to achieve it.

4. **Lack of MEX Calculation**: The program does not calculate the MEX of any subarray, which is a crucial part of the problem. The MEX operation is not implemented at all.

5. **Incorrect Output for Different Cases**: The program's output is incorrect for most test cases. For example, for an input array of length 3 with elements [1, 3, 9], the program prints "13 0" which is not the correct maximum sum. The correct maximum sum for this case is 13, but the program should also output the sequence of operations that achieve this sum, which it does not.

6. **General Solution**: The program does not provide a general solution for arrays of different lengths or with different elements. It only handles the specific case of an array of length 2 and a fixed output for all other lengths.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
