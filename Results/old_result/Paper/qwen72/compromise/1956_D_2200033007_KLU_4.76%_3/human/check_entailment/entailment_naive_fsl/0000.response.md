Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` only handles the case when the length of the array `c` is 2, and it always prints a fixed output of `4 1` followed by `1 2`. For any other length, it prints `13 0`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The correct output should be:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the program will output:
```
13 0
```
This is clearly incorrect, as the program does not compute the maximum sum or the operations needed to achieve it for arrays of length other than 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
