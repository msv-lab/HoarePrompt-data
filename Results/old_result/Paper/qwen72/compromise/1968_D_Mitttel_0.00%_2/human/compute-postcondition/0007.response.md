Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 <= `PB`, `PS` <= `n`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing a permutation of 1 to `n`, `a` is a list of `n` positive integers, `bodya_score` is the result of `calculate_score(PB)`, `sasha_score` is the result of `calculate_score(PS)`, and `bodya_score` is greater than or equal to `sasha_score`.***
