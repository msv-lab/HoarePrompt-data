The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. The variable `i` in the loop head is set to iterate from 1 to `n + 1`, but before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n`. This initial state of `i` is not relevant to the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The loop will start with `i` being 1, regardless of its initial value.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The initial state of `i` is not relevant to the loop's execution, and `j` and `sum` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, `sum` is 0**
