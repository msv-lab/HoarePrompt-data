Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is `n`, and `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer between 0 and 498, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains the input integer, as it is not modified by the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1` because the loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive), and `i` is incremented by 1 each time.
- **`j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + r`, where `r` is the final value of `r`.
- **`r`**: The value of `r` will be `n` after the loop completes. This is because `r` is set to the current value of `i` each time the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, and the loop runs from `1` to `n`, so `r` will be `n` after the last iteration.
- **`sum`**: The value of `sum` will be the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all iterations where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the sum of `i * n` for all iterations where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` is true. This means that for each iteration, `sum` is incremented by either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n`, depending on the condition.
