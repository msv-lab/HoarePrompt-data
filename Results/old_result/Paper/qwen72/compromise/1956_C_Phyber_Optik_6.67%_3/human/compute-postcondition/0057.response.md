Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is 0, and `sum` is `n * n + (n + 1) * n`**

Explanation: The value of `sum` is updated by adding `i * n` to its current value. Since `i` is `n + 1`, the new value of `sum` becomes `n * n + (n + 1) * n`. All other variables remain unchanged.
