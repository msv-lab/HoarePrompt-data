The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 500.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `n` and `r` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0 for the loop to continue.

Since `i` is now 2, the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` (which is 2) is less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is 1. Otherwise, `sum` is `n` and `r` is 0.**
