Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `sum` is calculated based on the conditions provided, but it is not directly relevant to the print statement.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, j % n, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The first value printed is the integer `2`.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determine `j % n`:**
   - `j` is 3.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - The value of `j % n` depends on the value of `n`:
     - If `n` is 1, then `j % n` is `3 % 1` which is `0`.
     - If `n` is 2, then `j % n` is `3 % 2` which is `1`.
     - If `n` is 3, then `j % n` is `3 % 3` which is `0`.
     - If `n` is greater than 3, then `j % n` is `3 % n` which is `3`.

5. **Output:**
   - The output will be `2` followed by the value of `j % n` followed by a space.
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, the possible values for `j % n` are `0`, `1`, or `3`.

Therefore, the final output will be:
Output: **2 [j % n] (where [j % n] is the remainder when 3 is divided by n, and can be 0, 1, or 3 depending on the value of n)**
