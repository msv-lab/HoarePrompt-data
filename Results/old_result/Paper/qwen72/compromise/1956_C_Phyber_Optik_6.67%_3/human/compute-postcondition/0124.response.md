Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement will output the values of `1` and `j`.
   - The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Value of `j`:**
   - According to the initial state, `j` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The condition about `j` being less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n` does not change the value of `j` itself; it only provides a constraint on `n`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will output `1` followed by `j` (which is 3), and the output will end with a space.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **1 3 **
