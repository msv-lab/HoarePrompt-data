To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given program state and the loop head.

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is `n + 1`.
- `j` is `n + r`.
- `r` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

### Loop Head:
```
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

### Analysis:
- The loop head involves the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`.
- The loop will execute if the range `1` to `n + r + 1` is valid, which means `n + r + 1` must be greater than `1`.
- Given that `r` is `n`, the condition simplifies to `n + n + 1 > 1`, or `2n + 1 > 1`, which is always true for any positive integer `n`.
- Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `n` is a positive integer.

### Adjustments:
- The variable `j` is not initialized before the loop, but it will be set to `1` at the start of the loop.
- The variable `n` and `r` must be such that `n + r + 1` is greater than `1`, which is always true for positive `n`.

### Final State:
- `t` is an integer between 0 and 498 (unchanged).
- `n` is a positive integer (unchanged).
- `i` is `n + 1` (unchanged).
- `j` is `1` (adjusted to the start value of the loop).
- `r` is `n` (unchanged).
- `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` (unchanged).

### State:
**`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is 1, `r` is `n`, and `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.**
