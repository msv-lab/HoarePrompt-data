Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 0, `r` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.**

The value of `r` is now 1, as it has been assigned the value of `i`, which was 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
