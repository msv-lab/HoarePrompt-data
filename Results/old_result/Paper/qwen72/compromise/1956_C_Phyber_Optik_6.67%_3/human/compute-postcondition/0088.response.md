Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.**

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `j`, `r`, and `sum`) remain unchanged, but their values are now based on the new value of `n`.
