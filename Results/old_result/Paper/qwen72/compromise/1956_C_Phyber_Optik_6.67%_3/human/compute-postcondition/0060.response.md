Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `r` is `n + 1`. If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is `n * n + n * (n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `sum` is `n * n + (n + 1) * n`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `r` is updated to `i`, which is `n + 1`.
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
- The condition for `sum` remains the same, as it depends on the values of `n` and `i`, which have not changed in a way that affects this condition.
