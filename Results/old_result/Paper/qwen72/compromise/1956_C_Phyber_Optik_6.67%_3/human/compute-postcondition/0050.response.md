Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is `n`, `j` is `n + 1`, `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`, and the current value of `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n`.** 

The value of `sum` is updated to `n * (n + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `n * (n + 1) // 2` is greater than `i * n` still holds true.
