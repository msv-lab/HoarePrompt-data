Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 498.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `r` is `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the current value of `j` is less than or equal to `n`. Otherwise, `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will output the values of `1` and `j`, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).
   - The value of `1` is explicitly 1.
   - The value of `j` is explicitly given as 2 in the initial state.

4. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output `1` and `2`, followed by a space.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **1 2**
