The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `n`, and `r`. The loop will execute one more time if `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 1
- `n` is greater than 0
- `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`)

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. The conditions for `n` and `r` remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`), `j` is 2. If `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` holds. If `j` is greater than `n + r`, the condition `j > n + r` holds.**
