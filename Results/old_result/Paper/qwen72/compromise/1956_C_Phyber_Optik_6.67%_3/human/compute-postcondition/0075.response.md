Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 499.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is true, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is false.
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` is true.
   - If `j` is greater than `n + r`, the condition `j <= n + r` is false.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement will print the integer `1` and the value of `j`.
   - The value of `j` is explicitly given as 2.
   - The `end=' '` parameter in the print function means that the output will end with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Output:**
   - The integer `1` will be printed.
   - The integer `2` will be printed.
   - The output will end with a space.

Therefore, the final output is:
Output: **1 2 **
