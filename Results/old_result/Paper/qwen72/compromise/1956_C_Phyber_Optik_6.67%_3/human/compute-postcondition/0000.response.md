The value of `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input, and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and 500. The value of `n` and the precondition that each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is an integer between 1 and 500 for each test case.**
