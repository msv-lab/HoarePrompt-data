The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter for the `range(t)` loop. This loop iterates a fixed number of times, determined by the value of `t` at the start of the loop. Since the loop counter `_` is not explicitly tracked in the state, we only need to adjust `t` to reflect the remaining number of iterations.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500. After one iteration, `t` should be decremented by 1 to reflect the remaining iterations. However, since `t` is the total number of iterations and the loop counter `_` is not explicitly mentioned, we do not need to adjust `_` itself. The loop will execute one more time as long as `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`), `j` is `n + r + 1`**
