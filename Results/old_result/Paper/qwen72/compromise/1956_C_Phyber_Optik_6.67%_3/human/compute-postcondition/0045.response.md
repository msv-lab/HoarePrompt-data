Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499, `n` is an input integer, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`), `j` is `n + r + 1`**. 

The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The values of `t`, `i`, `r`, and `j` remain unchanged, but `i` and `j` are still dependent on the new value of `n`. The condition for `r` and the expression for `j` are still valid with the updated value of `n`.
