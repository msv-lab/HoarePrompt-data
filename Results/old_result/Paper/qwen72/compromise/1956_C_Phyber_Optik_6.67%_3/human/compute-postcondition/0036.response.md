Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` (or `n` if the condition holds for all `i` from 1 to `n`), `j` is 2. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n + r` holds. If `j` is greater than `n`, the condition `j > n + r` holds.***
