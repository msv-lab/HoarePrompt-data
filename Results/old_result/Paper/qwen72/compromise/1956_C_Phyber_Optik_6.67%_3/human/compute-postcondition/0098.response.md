Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 498, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is 2, and `sum` is either `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` if `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, or `n` if `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`.**

Explanation:
- `r` is updated to the value of `i`, which is 2.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `sum`) remain unchanged.
- The value of `j` is still `n + r`, but now `r` is 2.
- The condition for `sum` remains the same, but with the updated value of `r`.
