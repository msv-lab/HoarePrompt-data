You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases where each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and is provided in the input.

    #State: `t` is 0, `n` is the last positive integer input, `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + r`, `r` is `n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n` for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters but reads input from the user to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it receives an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of a matrix. The function computes a sum and a value `r` based on the input `n`, and prints the sum and `n + r`. It then prints a series of lines, each containing a type (1 or 2), a value, and a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` set to 0, `n` set to the last positive integer input, `i` set to `n + 1`, `j` set to `n + r`, `r` set to the last computed value, and `sum` set to the total computed sum for the last test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \).

2. **Solution Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to fill the matrix with the largest possible values.
   - The maximum sum of the matrix is \( n \times n \times n \) because each element can be \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements.
   - However, the provided solution does not directly achieve this. Instead, it seems to be attempting to fill the matrix with permutations of \( 1 \) to \( n \) in a way that maximizes the sum.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each \( i \), it checks if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is greater than \( i \times n \).
     - If true, it sets \( r \) to \( i \) and adds \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) to \( \text{sum} \).
     - If false, it adds \( i \times n \) to \( \text{sum} \).
   - It then prints \( \text{sum} \) and \( n + r \) as the number of operations.
   - It prints \( n + r \) operations:
     - For the first \( n \) operations, it prints Type 1 operations, setting each row \( j \) to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
     - For the next \( r \) operations, it prints Type 2 operations, setting each column \( j \% n \) to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) is incorrect. The maximum sum should be \( n^3 \), but the code does not achieve this.
   - The number of operations \( n + r \) is not necessarily the correct number of operations to maximize the sum.
   - The operations themselves are not optimal for maximizing the sum. Filling the matrix with permutations of \( 1 \) to \( n \) does not necessarily maximize the sum.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - The correct approach is to fill the entire matrix with the value \( n \) using \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is \( n \), and the sum is \( n^3 \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as required by the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
