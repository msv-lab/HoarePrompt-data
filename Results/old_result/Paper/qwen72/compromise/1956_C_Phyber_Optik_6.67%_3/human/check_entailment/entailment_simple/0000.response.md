Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either set a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each \( i \), it checks if \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is greater than \( i \times n \).
     - If true, it sets `r` to \( i \) and adds \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) to `sum`.
     - If false, it adds \( i \times n \) to `sum`.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum for the matrix. The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix where each row and column is set to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n \times n \times (n + 1) // 2 \).

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated `sum` and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations. For the first \( n \) operations, it sets each row to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - For the next \( r \) operations, it sets each column to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

### Correctness Issues:
- **Sum Calculation:** The sum calculation logic is flawed. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times n \times (n + 1) // 2 \), which is the sum of all elements in the matrix if each row and column is set to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
- **Number of Operations:** The number of operations \( n + r \) is not necessarily the correct number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. The program should ensure that the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

### Correct Solution:
To maximize the sum, we can simply set each row to the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) and each column to the same permutation. This will ensure that each element in the matrix is set to a value between 1 and \( n \), and the sum will be \( n \times n \times (n + 1) // 2 \).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum
        max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
        
        # Number of operations needed: n (for rows) + n (for columns) = 2n
        operations = 2 * n
        
        print(max_sum, operations)
        
        # Set each row to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        # Set each column to the permutation [1, 2, ..., n]
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed sum calculation and the potential overestimation of the number of operations. The corrected program ensures that the sum is maximized and the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

Correctness: **False**
