Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires distributing coins across `n` outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - For each outcome `i`, the amount received back is `k_i * x_i`, where `x_i` is the bet on the `i`-th outcome.
   - The total bet should be `sum(x_i) < min(k_i * x_i)` for all `i`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.
   - It calculates the product of all multipliers `m`.
   - It then calculates the bet for each outcome as `m / k[i]` and stores it in the list `c`.
   - The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list `c`.
   - The program then divides each element in `c` by the GCD to ensure the bets are the smallest possible integers.
   - It checks if the sum of the bets is less than `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly calculates the product `m` of all multipliers.
   - The bets `c[i]` are calculated as `m / k[i]`, which ensures that the amount received back for each outcome is `k_i * (m / k_i) = m`.
   - The GCD is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible integers while maintaining the same relative proportions.
   - The check `sum(c) < m / hcf` ensures that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - The program handles the case where no solution exists by printing `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `n = 1` or all `k_i` are the same, which would result in no valid distribution of coins.
   - The program also handles the case where the sum of the bets is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
