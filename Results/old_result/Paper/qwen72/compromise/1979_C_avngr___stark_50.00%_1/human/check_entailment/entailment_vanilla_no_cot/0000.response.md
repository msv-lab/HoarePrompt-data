Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the way the program calculates the bets for each outcome. The program multiplies all the multipliers together to get `m` and then divides `m` by each multiplier to get the bets. This approach does not ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Calculation of `m`**:
   - The program multiplies all the multipliers together to get `m`. This is not necessary and can lead to very large numbers, which is not efficient and might not be required for the problem.

2. **Calculation of bets**:
   - The program then divides `m` by each multiplier to get the bets. This ensures that the return for each winning outcome is `m`, but it does not guarantee that the total sum of bets is strictly less than `m`.

3. **HCF Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the bets and divides each bet by the HCF to reduce the bets. However, this does not necessarily ensure that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to `m / hcf`. If it is, it prints `-1`. This check is not sufficient to ensure the correctness of the solution.

A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets such that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. One way to do this is to use a more systematic approach to find the minimum bets that satisfy the condition. For example, you can use a binary search or a more direct method to find the smallest possible bets.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    k = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize bets to 1
    c = [1] * n
    
    # Find the minimum total sum of bets such that the condition is satisfied
    total_sum = sum(c)
    while True:
        valid = True
        for i in range(n):
            if k[i] * c[i] <= total_sum:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            break
        # Increase the bet for the outcome with the smallest multiplier
        min_k_index = k.index(min(k))
        c[min_k_index] += 1
        total_sum = sum(c)
    
    if valid:
        print(' '.join(map(str, c)))
    else:
        print(-1)
```

This version initializes all bets to 1 and then iteratively increases the bet for the outcome with the smallest multiplier until the condition is satisfied. This ensures that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.
