### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the list of multipliers `k`.

2. **Product Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the product `m` of all multipliers `k_i`. This is intended to ensure that the bets `c_i` are multiples of the multipliers, which is a good approach to ensure that the total bet is less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The program then calculates the bets `c_i` as `m / k_i` for each outcome. This ensures that the total bet `sum(c)` is the sum of these values.
   - The program then finds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets `c` using the function `func_1`.

4. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of the list `numbers` (which is the list of bets `c`).
   - The GCD is used to reduce the bets to the smallest possible values that still satisfy the conditions.

5. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the reduced bets `sum(c)` is less than the product `m / hcf`. If it is, the program prints the bets; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

6. **Output:**
   - The output format is correct, printing the bets for each test case or `-1` if no solution exists.

### Issues:

1. **Product Calculation:**
   - The product `m` of all multipliers `k_i` can become very large, especially when `n` is close to 50 and `k_i` is close to 20. This can lead to overflow issues or inefficiency.
   - Instead of calculating the product of all `k_i`, a more efficient approach would be to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the `k_i` values and use that to calculate the bets.

2. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The GCD calculation is correct, but it is not necessary to calculate the product `m` first. The GCD can be calculated directly from the list `k`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if sum(c) >= m / hcf:` is correct for determining if a solution exists. However, the calculation of `m` and `c` can be optimized.

### Correctness:

Despite the potential inefficiency in the product calculation, the logic of the program is correct. The program will correctly determine if a solution exists and output the bets or `-1` as required. However, for large inputs, the program might be inefficient due to the large product calculation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem constraints. However, it could be optimized for better performance, especially for larger inputs.
