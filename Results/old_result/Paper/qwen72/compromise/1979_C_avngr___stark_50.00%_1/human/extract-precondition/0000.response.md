It seems there is a mismatch between the provided function definition and the problem description. The function definition `def func_1(numbers):` does not match the problem description, which requires a function to solve a betting game problem. Let's correct the function definition to match the problem and then extract the precondition.

Corrected function definition:
```python
def distribute_coins(n, k):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and k is a list of n integers where each integer k_i satisfies 2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20.**
