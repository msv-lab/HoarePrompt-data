The value of `i` (the first character in `s`) is added to the set `a`. The initial state specifies that `s` must contain at least one character, and `i` is the first character in `s`. Therefore, the set `a` now contains the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` must contain at least one character, `i` is the first character in `s`, `a` contains the first character of `s`.**
