Postcondition: **`s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed), `i` has iterated through each character in `s` and is now incremented by 1, `a` is a set containing all unique characters from `s`, `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`, `a` contains more than one unique character, `newstr` is the string formed by concatenating the second half of `s` (from the middle to the end) with the first half of `s` (from the start to the middle), `isreverse` is the reversed string of `s`, and `newstr` is equal to `s`. Additionally, `isreverse` is equal to `s`.**
