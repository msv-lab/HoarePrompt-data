Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed), `a` is an empty set, `i` has iterated through each character in `s` and is now incremented by 1, `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`. If the length of `a` is greater than 1, `isreverse` is a string that is the reverse of `s`. If `newstr` is not equal to `s`, the program continues with these conditions. If `newstr` is equal to `s`, then `isreverse` is also equal to `s`. If the length of `a` is less than or equal to 1, no changes are made to `s`, `a`, or `i`.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    a.add(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed) and must have at least one character, `i` is the first character in `s`, `a` is a set containing the first character of `s`, `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed) and must have at least two characters, `i` is the second character in `s`, `a` is a set containing the first and second characters of `s`, `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` contains all its original characters (with leading and trailing spaces removed) and must have at least three characters, `i` is the third character in `s`, `a` is a set containing the first, second, and third characters of `s`, `t` must be greater than the current value of `i`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
