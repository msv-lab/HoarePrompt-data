The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function might internally use or generate values for `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and each string `s` is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function's output is not specified in the problem statement, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly. It is implied to use or generate an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) and a string `s` (length at most 10, consisting of lowercase English letters) internally. The specific return value is not provided in the problem statement.**
