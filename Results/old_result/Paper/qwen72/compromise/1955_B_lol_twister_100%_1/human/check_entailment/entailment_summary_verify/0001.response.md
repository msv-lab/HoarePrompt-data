Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list of integers `l`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element**: The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is a crucial step because the value `a` corresponds to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square, which is the smallest element in the matrix.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**: The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for all pairs `(k, h)` where `0 <= k < n` and `0 <= h < n`. This correctly reflects the construction of the progressive square based on the given rules.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**: The program sorts both the generated list `li` and the input list `l`. It then compares these two sorted lists to check if they are identical. If they are, it means the input list `l` can form the progressive square, and the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of the function `func_1` for each test case, which is either 'yes' or 'no'.

However, there is a minor issue with the output format. The problem description specifies that the output should be "YES" or "NO" (case-insensitive), but the function `func_1` returns 'yes' or 'no'. This discrepancy could lead to incorrect results if the judge system strictly checks for the exact string "YES" or "NO".

To address this, the function `func_1` should return 'YES' or 'NO' instead of 'yes' or 'no'. Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

Given the above correction, the program will now correctly handle the output format as required by the problem description.

Final: **True** (with the noted correction to the output format)
