The only variables in the loop head are `h` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `h` and `n`. If `h` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and `h` is 0. At the start of the next iteration, `h` is incremented by 1, so `h` becomes 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `h`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, `h` is 1, `li` contains the element `a + k * c`**
