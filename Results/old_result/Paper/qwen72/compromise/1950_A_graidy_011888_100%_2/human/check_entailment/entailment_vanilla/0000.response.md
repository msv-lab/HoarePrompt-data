### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the first condition is false, it checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `a < b and b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs "STAIR" for a sequence where `a < b < c`.
   - It correctly outputs "PEAK" for a sequence where `a < b > c`.
   - It correctly outputs "NONE" for any other sequence.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should output "NONE".
   - It also handles the edge case where the digits are in descending order (e.g., `3 2 1`), which should output "NONE".

5. **Constraints:**
   - The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description:
     - `1 \leq t \leq 1000` for the number of test cases.
     - `0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9` for the digits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
