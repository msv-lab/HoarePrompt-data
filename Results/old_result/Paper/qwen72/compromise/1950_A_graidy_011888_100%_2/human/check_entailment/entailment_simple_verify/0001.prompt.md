You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The function `func` is expected to be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, the function receives three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` as input, where each digit is an integer such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. `n` is an input integer. After the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined (as they are reassigned in each iteration), and `i` is equal to `n-1` (the last index of the loop). The loop will have printed 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' for each iteration based on the conditions provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from a single line of input using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints "STAIR".
   - If the first condition is false, it checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `a < b and b > c`. If this condition is true, it prints "PEAK".
   - If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs "STAIR" for a sequence where `a < b < c`.
   - It correctly outputs "PEAK" for a sequence where `a < b > c`.
   - It correctly outputs "NONE" for any other sequence.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), which should output "NONE".
   - It also handles the edge case where the digits are in descending order (e.g., `3 2 1`), which should output "NONE".

5. **Constraints:**
   - The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description:
     - `1 \leq t \leq 1000` for the number of test cases.
     - `0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9` for the digits.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It handles all the specified conditions and edge cases as required by the problem description.
