Reasoning:  
The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function `func` reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times, reading three digits in each iteration. The conditions for determining if the digits form a "STAIR" or "PEAK" are correctly implemented:

1. **STAIR**: The condition `a < b < c` correctly checks if the digits form an increasing sequence.
2. **PEAK**: The condition `a < b and b > c` correctly checks if the digits form a peak (i.e., `b` is greater than both `a` and `c`).
3. **NONE**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program correctly outputs "NONE".

The program also correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Each test case is processed independently, and the final output is printed for each test case based on the conditions.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
