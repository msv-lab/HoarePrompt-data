You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is `n-1`, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2, ..., `a[n-1]` is increased by `n`.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of each element in `a` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` in their original order, and additional elements that fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` such that the total number of elements in `ans` is `n`.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer `a_i` was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been increased by `i + 1` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`), and `a` is now sorted in descending order, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated and now unique list `a`, but the count of each element in `a` is decreased by 1, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements of `a` in their original order, and additional elements that fill the gaps between consecutive elements of `a` such that the total number of elements in `ans` is `n + cnt`. The last element of `ans` is `ans[-1] - cnt`.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 11 10 9 8 7
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 10^4), `n` (an integer between 1 and 3 · 10^5), and `a` (a list of `n` integers, each between 1 and 10^9). The function processes the list `a` for each of the `t` test cases and returns a result based on the elements in the list for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
