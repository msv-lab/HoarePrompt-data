Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `i` is 1, `a[0]` is increased by 1, `a[1]` is increased by 2.**

Explanation: The code `a[i] += i + 1` increments the value of `a[1]` by 2, since `i` is 1. The other conditions and values remain unchanged.
