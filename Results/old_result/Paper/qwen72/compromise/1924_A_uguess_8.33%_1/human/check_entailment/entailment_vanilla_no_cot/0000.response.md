Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic for Generating Subsequences**: The program uses a bitwise operation to track the presence of characters in the string `s`. However, this logic is flawed because it does not correctly track all possible subsequences of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

2. **Counting Subsequences**: The program increments `cnt` when `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, which is a bitmask representing all `k` characters being present in the string `s`. This does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: The program attempts to generate a missing subsequence by appending characters, but it does not correctly handle the generation of a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings is not a subsequence, print "NO" followed by that string. If all possible strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_subsequence(x, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def generate_all_strings(n, k):
    from itertools import product
    return [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        all_possible_strings = generate_all_strings(n, k)
        
        for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(possible_string, s):
                print('NO')
                print(possible_string)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **is_subsequence Function**: This function checks if a given string `x` is a subsequence of `s` using an iterator.
2. **generate_all_strings Function**: This function generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
3. **Main Logic**: For each test case, it generates all possible strings and checks if any of them is not a subsequence of `s`. If such a string is found, it prints "NO" followed by that string. If all possible strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This corrected program should handle the problem as described.
