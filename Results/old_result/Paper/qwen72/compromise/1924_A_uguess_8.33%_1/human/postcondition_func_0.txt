The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, followed by a string `s` of length `m` containing only the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then processes the string `s` to determine if it contains at least `n` complete sets of the first `k` alphabets. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a string that represents the incomplete set and the remaining characters needed to complete `n` sets. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
