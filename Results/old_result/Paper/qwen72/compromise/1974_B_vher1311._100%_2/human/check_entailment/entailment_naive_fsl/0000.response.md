Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description. It constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting and removing duplicates from the encoded string `b`. It then creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from the mapping. This approach works for all potential cases, including strings with repeated characters, single-character strings, and strings of various lengths. The program also correctly handles the input format, reading multiple test cases and their respective inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
