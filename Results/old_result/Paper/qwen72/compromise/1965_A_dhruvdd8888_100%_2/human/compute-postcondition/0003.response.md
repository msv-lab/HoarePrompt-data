Output State: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of piles, piles is a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), N is an input integer, nums is a sorted list of integers from the input with 0 added to it.**

Explanation:
- The initial state variables `t`, `n`, `piles`, and `N` remain unchanged.
- The variable `nums` was initially a set of strings from the input with '0' added to it. After the code `nums = sorted(map(int, nums))` is executed, `nums` is now a sorted list of integers. The strings in `nums` are converted to integers using `map(int, nums)`, and then the list is sorted in ascending order. The value '0' is also included in this sorted list.
