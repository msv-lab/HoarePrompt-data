Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is called, but it does not take any parameters. The problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases and process a binary string for each test case. However, the function does not explicitly take these parameters, which is a minor issue but does not affect the correctness of the logic within the function.

2. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` from the input and then iterates over each test case.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers. This is a valid way to handle the input.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string and initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of zeros and ones encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost of sorting the string.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The function iterates over each character in the string `s` and updates the counts in `cnt`.
   - If the character is `0`, it adds 1 to `ans` if there are any ones (`cnt[1] > 0`), indicating that a shift is needed to move the zero to the correct position.
   - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of zeros that have not been counted yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`, indicating the cost to move the one to the correct position.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the string, the function prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111").
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the string is not sorted and needs to be transformed (e.g., "101011").

7. **Complexity**:
   - The function processes each test case in linear time, which is efficient given the constraints.

8. **State of the Program**:
   - The state comments indicate that the function correctly processes the input and calculates the total cost. The variables `n`, `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` are used appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The function logic is sound and handles the input and output as required.

Correctness: **True**
