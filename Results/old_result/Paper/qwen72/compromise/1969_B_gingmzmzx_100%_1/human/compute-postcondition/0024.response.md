To determine what will be printed when the `print(ans)` statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`n`**: This is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. **`s`**: This is a list of integers representing the digits of an input string. Each element in `s` is either 0 or 1.
3. **`zeroes`**: This is the number of zeros in the list `s`.
4. **`cnt`**: This is a list where:
   - `cnt[0]` is the count of zeros in `s` (which is the same as `zeroes`).
   - `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in `s`.
5. **`ans`**: This is the sum of the number of zeros that appear after any one in the list `s`.

To calculate `ans`, we need to iterate through the list `s` and count the number of zeros that appear after each one. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

- Initialize `ans` to 0.
- Iterate through the list `s` from the beginning to the end.
- For each element in `s`:
  - If the element is 1, count the number of zeros that appear after this 1 in the list `s`.
  - Add this count to `ans`.

Since the exact list `s` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, `ans` will be the sum of the number of zeros that appear after any one in the list `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the number of zeros that appear after any one in the list `s`)**
