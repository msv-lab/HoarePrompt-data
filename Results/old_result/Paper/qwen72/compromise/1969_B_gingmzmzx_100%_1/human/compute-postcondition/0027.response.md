Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of zeros that appear after any one in the list `s`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `zeroes` is updated to the number of zeros in the list `s` using `s.count(0)`.
- The values of `n`, `s`, `cnt`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code snippet.
