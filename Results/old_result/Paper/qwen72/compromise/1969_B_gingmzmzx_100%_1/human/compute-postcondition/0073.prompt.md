Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the binary string and possibly the number of test cases. A corrected function definition might look like: `def min_cost_sort(s, t=1):` where `s` is a binary string and `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5. `n` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(n):
    s = list(map(int, input().strip()))
    zeroes = s.count(0)
    cnt = [0, 0]
    ans = 0
    for c in s:
        cnt[c] += 1
        if c == 0:
            ans += 1 if cnt[1] > 0 else 0
        else:
            ans += zeroes - cnt[0]
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of zeros that appear after any one in the list `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of zeros in `s` plus the product of the number of ones in `s` and the number of zeros in `s` minus the number of zeros encountered so far.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the number of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the number of ones in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of ones in `s` for each zero in `s` plus the sum of the number of zeros in `s` for each one in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
