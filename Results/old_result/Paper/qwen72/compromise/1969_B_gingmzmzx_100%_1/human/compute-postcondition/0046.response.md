Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string with at least 3 elements, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the third element of `s`, `cnt` is [2, 0] if `c` is 0, otherwise `cnt` is [1, 1], and `ans` is 1 if `c` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `2 * (zeroes - 1)`.***
