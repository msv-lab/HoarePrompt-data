Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is the count of zeros in `s` and `cnt[1]` is the count of ones in `s`, `ans` is the sum of the number of zeros that appear after any one in the list `s`.**

Explanation:
- The code `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` updates the value of `s` to a new list of integers, where each integer is a digit from the input string.
- The initial state specifies that `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string, which is now true after the code execution.
- The values of `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` are not changed by this code snippet, so they remain as specified in the initial state.
