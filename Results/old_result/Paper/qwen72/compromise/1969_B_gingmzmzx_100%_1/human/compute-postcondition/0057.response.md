Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and decremented by 1, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input string that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the first element of `s` and is 0, `zeroes` is the number of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is a list where `cnt[0]` is 0 and `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1, otherwise `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is incremented by 1 if `cnt[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it remains 0.
- Since `cnt[1]` is 1 if `c` is 1, and `c` is 0, `cnt[1]` is not greater than 0.
- Therefore, `ans` remains 0.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
