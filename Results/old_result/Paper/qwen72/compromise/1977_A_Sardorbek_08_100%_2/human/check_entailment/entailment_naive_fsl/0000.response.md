Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `n` is less than `m`. For example, if `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the program will output "No" because it checks if `b < c` and prints "No" if true. However, it is impossible to build a tower with 3 cubes in 2 moves, so the correct output should be "No". The program should check if `n` is less than `m` and print "No" in such cases. The current logic only checks if `b` is less than `c`, which is not sufficient to cover all edge cases.
