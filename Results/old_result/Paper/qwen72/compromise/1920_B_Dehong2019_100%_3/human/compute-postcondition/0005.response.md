Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `_` is a placeholder variable, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, where the integers are provided as input, `ans1` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`.** 

In natural language: The initial state remains the same, but now `ans1` holds the sum of all the integers in the list `a`.
