The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, two integers `k` and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a modified sum of the elements in `a`. The modified sum is computed by initially summing all elements in `a`, then subtracting twice the sum of the first `x` elements, and finally adjusting this sum by adding the first `k` elements and subtracting twice the elements from index `x` to `x + k - 1` (if these indices are within bounds). The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
