You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and p are lists of integers of the same length n, where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. s is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where 1 <= s[0], s[1] <= n. k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: The loop terminates when either `vis[s]` is 1 or `k` is 0. At this point, `mx` will be the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution. `cur` will be the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited in the loop. `k` will be the remaining number of iterations, which is 0 if the loop terminated due to `k` reaching 0, or a positive integer if the loop terminated due to `vis[s]` being 1. `vis` will be a list of length `n` where each element visited by `s` during the loop will be 1, and all other elements will remain 0.
    return mx
    #The program returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited in the loop, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `a[s]` is the value at position `s` in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `p` (a permutation of integers from 1 to n), `s` (a list of two integers representing starting positions), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `a[s]` is the value at position `s` in the list `a`. The loop terminates when either a position in `s` is revisited (i.e., `vis[s]` is 1) or `k` reaches 0. After the function concludes, `mx` holds the maximum value computed, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for all visited positions, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `vis` is a list indicating which positions in `p` have been visited.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Indices:**
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because Python uses 0-based indexing, while the problem description uses 1-based indexing.
   - However, this adjustment is incorrect. The elements of `p` should be adjusted, but the elements of `a` should remain as they are because `a` is not a permutation and does not need to be adjusted in the same way.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the game for a given starting position `s` and the number of turns `k`.
   - It initializes `mx` to 0, which will store the maximum score the player can achieve.
   - It initializes `cur` to 0, which will store the current score.
   - It initializes a list `vis` to keep track of visited positions.
   - The while loop runs until the current position `s` is visited or `k` turns are exhausted.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It marks the current position `s` as visited.
     - It updates `mx` to the maximum score possible by staying at the current position for the remaining turns.
     - It adds the score at the current position to `cur`.
     - It decrements `k` by 1.
     - It moves to the next position `p[s]`.

4. **Output:**
   - After simulating the game for both Bodya and Sasha, the program compares their final scores and prints the result accordingly.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Adjustment of `a`:** The elements of `a` should not be adjusted by subtracting 1. This is a critical error because it changes the values of the scores, which are supposed to be in the range [1, 10^9].

### Corrected Code:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1  # Adjust permutation indices to 0-based
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        cur += a[s]
        k -= 1
        s = p[s]
    return mx
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program remains as provided, due to the incorrect adjustment of `a`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect adjustment of `a` in the original program).
