The function `func_1` takes four parameters: `a` (a list of integers), `p` (a permutation of integers from 1 to n), `s` (a list of two integers representing starting positions), and `k` (a positive integer). It returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop execution, where `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for each position `s` visited, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `a[s]` is the value at position `s` in the list `a`. The loop terminates when either a position in `s` is revisited (i.e., `vis[s]` is 1) or `k` reaches 0. After the function concludes, `mx` holds the maximum value computed, `cur` is the sum of `a[s]` for all visited positions, `k` is the remaining number of iterations, and `vis` is a list indicating which positions in `p` have been visited.
