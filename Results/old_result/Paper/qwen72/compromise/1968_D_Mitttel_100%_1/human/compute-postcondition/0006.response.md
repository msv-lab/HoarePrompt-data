Output State: **`a` and `p` are lists of integers of the same length `n`, where `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`, `1 <= a[i] <= 10^9`, and `p` is a permutation of integers from `1` to `n`. `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, where `1 <= s[0], s[1] <= n`. `k` is a positive integer such that `1 <= k <= 10^9`. `n` is the length of the list `p`. `mx` is the maximum of the previous `mx` value (which was 0) and `cur + k * a[s[0]]` or `cur + k * a[s[1]]` (whichever is larger). `cur` is 0. `vis` is a list of length `n` where each element is 0, except `vis[s[0]]` and `vis[s[1]]` which are 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (0) and the value of `cur + k * a[s[0]]` or `cur + k * a[s[1]]` (whichever is larger).
- Since `cur` is 0, the new value of `mx` will be the maximum of 0 and `k * a[s[0]]` or `k * a[s[1]]`.
- The values of `a`, `p`, `s`, `k`, `n`, `cur`, and `vis` remain unchanged.
