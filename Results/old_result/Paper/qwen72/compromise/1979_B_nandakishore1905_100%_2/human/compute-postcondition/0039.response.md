Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 10^9, `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is 2 raised to the power of (`p` - 1).** 

Explanation: The value of `q` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of (`p` - 1), where `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.
