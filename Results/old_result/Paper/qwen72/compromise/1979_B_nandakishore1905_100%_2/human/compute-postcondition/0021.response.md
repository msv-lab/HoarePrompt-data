Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y <= 10^9`, `i` is `0`, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than `0`, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `k` is not a power of 2, `k` is even, `l` is the binary representation of `f` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the length of the string `l`, `q` is `2` raised to the power of `(p - 1)`, `f` is `k - 2*q` and `f` is not a power of 2.**

The code snippet `q = 2 ** (p - 1)` does not change the value of `q` because it is already defined in the initial state as `2` raised to the power of `(p - 1)`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
