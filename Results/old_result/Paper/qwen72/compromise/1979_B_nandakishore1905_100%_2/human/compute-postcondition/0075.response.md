Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are the new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m` and `k` must not be a power of 2, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), `f` is \(k - 2^{(p - 1)} - 2^{(p - 1)}\) and `f` must not be a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, and `p` is now the length of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `l = bin(f).replace('0b', '')` updates the value of `l` to the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix.
- The value of `f` is calculated as \(k - 2^{(p - 1)} - 2^{(p - 1)}\), which simplifies to \(k - 2 \times 2^{(p - 1)}\).
- The length of `l` is now the number of bits in the binary representation of `f`, which is stored in `p`.
- All other variables (`x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `f`) remain unchanged.
