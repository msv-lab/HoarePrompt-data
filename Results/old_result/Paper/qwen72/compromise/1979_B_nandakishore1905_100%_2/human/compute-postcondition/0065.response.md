Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are the new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.**

Explanation: The code snippet `l = bin(k).replace('0b', '')` converts the integer `k` to its binary representation and removes the '0b' prefix. The variable `l` now holds this binary string. The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
