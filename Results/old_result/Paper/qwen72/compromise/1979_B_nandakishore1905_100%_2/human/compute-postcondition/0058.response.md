Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 1, `n` and `m` are input integers where `n` and `m` are greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. If `k` is odd, no changes are made to the variables. If `k` is even and not a power of 2, `l` is the binary representation of `f` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `f`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\), and `f` is 0.***
