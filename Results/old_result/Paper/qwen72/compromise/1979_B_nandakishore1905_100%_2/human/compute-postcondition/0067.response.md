Output State: **`x` and `y` are distinct non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq x, y \leq 10^9\), `i` is 2, `n` and `m` are the new input integers greater than 0, `k` is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`, `l` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`, `q` is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).**

Explanation:
- The value of `q` is calculated as \(2^{(p - 1)}\), where `p` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `l`, and `p` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `q` is now part of the output state, and its value is \(2^{(p - 1)}\).
