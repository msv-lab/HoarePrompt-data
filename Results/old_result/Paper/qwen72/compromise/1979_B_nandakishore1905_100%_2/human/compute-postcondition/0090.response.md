Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a number of iterations from the user, then for each iteration, it reads two distinct non-negative integers `n` and `m` from the user. It calculates the absolute difference `k` between `n` and `m`. If `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`. If `k` is odd, it prints `1`. If `k` is even but not a power of 2, it prints the largest power of 2 that can be obtained by subtracting powers of 2 from `k` until the result is a power of 2. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state includes the number of iterations specified by the user, the last input integers `n` and `m`, and the final value of `k` which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`. **
