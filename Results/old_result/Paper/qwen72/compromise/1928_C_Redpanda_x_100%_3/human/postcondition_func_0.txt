The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 < n <= 10^9 and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. The function computes the prime factorization of `n`, storing the prime factors and their respective powers in a dictionary `factors`. After the factorization, the function converts the keys of `factors` into a list `primes` and yields each prime factor from this list. The final state of the program includes `factors` containing the prime factors of `n` and their powers, `nn` being equal to 1, and `i` being the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original `n`.
