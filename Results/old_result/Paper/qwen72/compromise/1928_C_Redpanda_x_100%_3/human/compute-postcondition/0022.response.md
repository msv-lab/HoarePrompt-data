The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`. The loop will execute one more time if `factors[prime] + 1` is greater than the current value of `_`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes)
- `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element
- `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`
- `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime_to_i * prime`
- `factor` is the next element from `rest`
- `factors[prime]` must be a non-negative integer
- A value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The loop variable `_` must be incremented by 1.
- The condition `factors[prime] + 1` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `_` is incremented by 1.
- `factors[prime]` must still be a non-negative integer, and the loop will execute if `factors[prime] + 1` is greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime_to_i * prime`, `factor` is the next element from `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be a non-negative integer, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded, `_` is incremented by 1, `factors[prime] + 1` must be greater than the new value of `_`**
