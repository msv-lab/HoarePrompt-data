The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `factors[prime]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `factors[prime]`. The loop will execute if `factors[prime]` is at least 0, because the loop will run `factors[prime] + 1` times. Therefore, `factors[prime]` must be a non-negative integer.

State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is 1, `factor` is the next element from `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be a non-negative integer**
