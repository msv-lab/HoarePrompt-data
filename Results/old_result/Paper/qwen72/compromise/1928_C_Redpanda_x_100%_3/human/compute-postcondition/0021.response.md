Output State: **`k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be a non-empty iterable with at least one more element, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, `prime_to_i` is equal to `prime_to_i * prime`, `factor` is the next element from `rest`, `factors[prime]` must be a non-negative integer, a value `factor * prime_to_i` has been yielded.**

Explanation:
- `prime_to_i` is updated to be `prime_to_i * prime`. Since `prime_to_i` was initially 1, it is now equal to `prime`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
