Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, `nn` is equal to 1, and `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original `n`.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, `nn` is equal to 1, and `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original `n`. If `nn` > 1, `factors[1]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `factors` remains unchanged.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, `factors` is a dictionary containing the prime factors of `n` and their respective powers, `nn` is equal to 1, `i` is the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original `n`, `primes` is a list of the prime factors of `n` (keys of the `factors` dictionary), `generate(0)` is a generator that has yielded all its values, and the generator has no more values to yield.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` such that 1 < n <= 10^9 and returns a generator that yields the prime factors of `n`. The function computes the prime factorization of `n`, storing the prime factors and their respective powers in a dictionary `factors`. After the factorization, the function converts the keys of `factors` into a list `primes` and yields each prime factor from this list. The final state of the program includes `factors` containing the prime factors of `n` and their powers, `nn` being equal to 1, and `i` being the smallest prime number greater than the square root of the original `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where primes is a list of prime numbers.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and all possible products of each `factor` in `rest` with each power of `prime` from 1 up to `primes[k]` raised to the power of `factors[prime]` have been yielded.
    #State: k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), where primes is a list of prime numbers. If k is equal to the length of the primes list, the generator has yielded the value 1. Otherwise, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < len(primes), `rest` is the result of `generate(k + 1)` and must be an empty iterable, `prime` is equal to `primes[k]`, and all possible products of each `factor` in `rest` with each power of `prime` from 1 up to `primes[k]` raised to the power of `factors[prime]` have been yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate` is a generator that, given a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 <= k <= len(primes), yields all possible products of the first `k` primes in the `primes` list raised to the powers specified in the `factors` dictionary. If `k` is equal to the length of the `primes` list, the generator yields the value 1. For each prime in the `primes` list up to the `k`-th prime, the generator recursively multiplies the results of the next level of recursion with the current prime raised to all powers from 0 up to the value specified in `factors` for that prime. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that all such products have been yielded, and the generator is exhausted.
