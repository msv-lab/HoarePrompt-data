The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each specified by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, it calculates a value `res` which is the sum of (i + 1) * (2 * i + 1) for i from 0 to n-1, and prints `res` alongside the value of `n << 1`. Additionally, for each value of `i` from `n` to 1, it prints two lines: the first line starts with '1' followed by `i` and the range from 1 to `n`, and the second line starts with '2' followed by `i` and the range from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results.
