Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the numbers in the matrix for every potential case. Specifically, the program assigns the same permutation to both rows and columns, which does not necessarily maximize the sum. For example, consider the case where \( n = 2 \):

- The program will output:
  ```
  7 4
  1 2 1 2
  2 2 1 2
  1 1 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```

- However, the correct output should be:
  ```
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```

The program uses more operations than necessary and does not ensure that the sum is maximized in the most efficient way. The correct approach should be to use the permutations in a way that maximizes the sum, and it can be shown that this can be done in no more than \( 2n \) operations.
