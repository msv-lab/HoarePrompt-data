Reasoning:

The provided program consists of two distinct parts: the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function and the `func_1` function. However, the `func_1` function is not related to the problem description for `generate_files_for_html_in_range`. The `func_1` function is a separate piece of code that reads input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions, and it is not called within the context of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, we need to focus on the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function to determine its correctness.

### Analysis of `generate_files_for_html_in_range` Function:
1. **Getting Subfolders:**
   - The function correctly uses `os.getcwd()` to get the current working directory.
   - It then uses `os.scandir()` to list all entries in the current directory and filters out only the directories using `f.is_dir()`.

2. **Checking Folder Names:**
   - The function checks if the folder name is a digit and falls within the specified range (`start` to `end`).

3. **Finding HTML Files:**
   - For each valid folder, it lists all files in the folder and filters out only the `.html` files using `f.endswith('.html')`.

4. **Generating Files:**
   - For each `.html` file found, it generates two new files: one with `-ac.py` appended to the base name and one with `-wa.py` appended.
   - It uses `os.path.splitext` to separate the file name and extension, and `os.path.join` to construct the full path for the new files.
   - It creates the new files using `open(file, 'w').close()`.

5. **Printing Information:**
   - The function prints the number of HTML files in each valid folder and the paths of the generated files.

### Issues:
- The annotated program mentions a state where `start` and `end` are integers such that `0 <= start <= end`. However, this state is not relevant to the `func_1` function, which is a separate piece of code.
- The `func_1` function is not called in the context of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function, and it does not interact with the `start` and `end` parameters in any way.

### Conclusion:
The `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function is correct based on the problem description and the provided comments. It correctly identifies subfolders, checks their names, finds `.html` files, and generates the required files. The `func_1` function is irrelevant to the problem and does not affect the correctness of the `generate_files_for_html_in_range` function.

Correctness: **True**
