### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `num_list`.

2. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each exponent in `num_list`.

3. **Triangle Formation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the sticks.
   - It does this by iterating through the counts of each exponent in `num_of_lens`:
     - If a particular exponent appears at least 3 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{cnt}{3} = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1) \times (cnt - 2)}{6} \).
     - If a particular exponent appears at least 2 times, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length using the formula \( \binom{cnt}{2} \times total\_count = \frac{cnt \times (cnt - 1)}{2} \times total\_count \), where `total_count` is the sum of all previous counts.
     - It updates `total_count` with the current count.

4. **Output:**
   - The program stores the result for each test case in a list `results` and prints the results after processing all test cases.

### Analysis:
- **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**
  - For three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\) to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sticks must be greater than the length of the third stick.
  - Given the lengths are powers of 2, the only way to form a non-degenerate triangle is if at least two of the sticks have the same length. This is because \(2^a + 2^b > 2^c\) only holds if \(a = b\) and \(c\) is the same or one of the other two exponents.

- **Combination Calculations:**
  - The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length and the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of the same length and one stick of a different length.
  - The combination formulas used are correct for the given problem.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where there are fewer than 3 sticks correctly by returning 0.
  - It also handles the case where all sticks have different lengths correctly by returning 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using the given sticks. The combination formulas and the conditions for forming a triangle are correctly applied.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
