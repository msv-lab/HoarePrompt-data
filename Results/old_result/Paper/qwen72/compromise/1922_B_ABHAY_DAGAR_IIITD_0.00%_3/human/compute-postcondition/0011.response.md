The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the list `num_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `num_list`. If `num_list` has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num_list` has at least 1 integer, `x` is the first integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes `x` as a key with its value increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `num_list` must have at least 2 integers. The next iteration will use the second integer in `num_list` as `x`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `x` is the second integer in `num_list`, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes the first integer of `num_list` as a key with its value increased by 1.**
