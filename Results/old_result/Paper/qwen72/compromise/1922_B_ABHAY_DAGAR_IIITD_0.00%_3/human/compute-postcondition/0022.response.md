The only objects in the loop head are `cnt` and `num_of_lens`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num_of_lens` dictionary. If the dictionary has at least one key-value pair, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `num_list` has at least `n` integers, and `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`. Therefore, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair for the loop to execute.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least one key-value pair, `res` is 0, `total_count` is 0**
