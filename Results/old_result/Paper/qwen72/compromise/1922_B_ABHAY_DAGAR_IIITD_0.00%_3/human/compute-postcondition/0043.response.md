The code snippet `results.append(res)` appends the value of `res` to the list `results`. The value of `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements. The other variables (`test_cases`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `res` is the sum of the combinations of choosing 3 elements from each integer's count plus the sum of the products of choosing 2 elements from each integer's count and the total count of all processed elements, `total_count` is the sum of all counts in `num_of_lens`.**
