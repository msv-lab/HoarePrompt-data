Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least one key-value pair remaining, `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values plus the current `cnt`, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`. If `cnt` is greater than or equal to 2, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `total_count += cnt` increments the value of `total_count` by the value of `cnt`.
- The initial state specifies that `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values plus the current `cnt`. After the execution of the code, `total_count` now includes the current `cnt` value in its sum.
- The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, and `res`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for updating `res` is not affected by this code snippet, so `res` remains in its initial state (unchanged or updated based on the previous conditions).

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `total_count` while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
