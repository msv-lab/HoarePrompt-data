The code snippet updates the value of `res` by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its previous value. The other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `total_count`, and `cnt`) are not directly modified by this code.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case.
- `results` is an empty list.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers.
- `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least two key-value pairs.
- `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values.
- `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`.

The output state will be:
- `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its previous value.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an input integer, `num_list` is a list of integers with at least `n` integers, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary that includes each integer from `num_list` as a key with its value representing the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list` and must have at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is the sum of the previous `cnt` values, `cnt` is the next value from `num_of_lens`, `res` is updated by adding `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count` to its previous value.**
