Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the final value of `res` after all iterations, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs, `total_count` is `cnt + cnt`, `x` is the last integer in the `num_list`, `n` is an input integer, `cnt` is the third value from `num_of_lens.values()`, and `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is updated by the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`.
- `total_count` is defined as `cnt + cnt`, which simplifies to `2 * cnt`.
- Therefore, `res` is increased by `cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * 2 * cnt`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `results`, `num_list`, `num_of_lens`, `x`, `n`, and `cnt`) remain unchanged.
