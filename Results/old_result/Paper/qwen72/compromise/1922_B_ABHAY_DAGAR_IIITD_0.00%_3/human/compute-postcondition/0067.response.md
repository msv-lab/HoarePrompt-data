The value of `res` is updated by adding the result of the expression `cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6` to its current value. Given that `cnt` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens` and `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, the expression calculates the number of combinations of 3 items that can be chosen from `cnt` items, and this value is added to `res`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the value of `res`, `num_list` is a list of integers provided by the input, `num_of_lens` is a dictionary where each integer in `num_list` is a key and its value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `num_list`, `num_of_lens` must have at least one key-value pair, `cnt` is the value of the first key in `num_of_lens`, `cnt` is greater than or equal to 3, `res` is `res + cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`, `total_count` is 0, `x` is the last integer in `num_list`.**
