The loop head contains the variable `_` and the object `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be an iterable, and in this case, it should be a list. The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the length of `test_cases`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `test_cases` must have at least one test case.

The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it is a throwaway variable used for iteration and will be assigned values from `range(test_cases)` during the loop execution. However, the length of `test_cases` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases with at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list**
