Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. It processes each test case to compute the number of ways to choose three sticks that can form a non-degenerate triangle, and stores these results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the list. The function does not return any value; instead, it modifies the state by printing the results to the console. After the function concludes, `test_cases` remains unchanged, and the results of the computations are printed to the console. **
