The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output conditions are not provided in the problem statement.
