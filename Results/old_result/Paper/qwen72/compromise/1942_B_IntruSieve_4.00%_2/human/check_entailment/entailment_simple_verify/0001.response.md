Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one by calling the `func_1` function.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**: The function reads the length `n` and the array `a` for each test case.
   - **Initialization**: It initializes two variables: `minn` to 0 and `maxx` to 0. These variables are used to keep track of the current range of values in the permutation.
   - **Constructing the Permutation**:
     - For each element `arr[i]` in `a`:
       - If `arr[i] > 0`, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. This is because if `a[i] > 0`, the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` must be `minn` and `p[i]` must be `minn - a[i]`, which simplifies to `minn` since `a[i]` is positive.
       - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because if `a[i] <= 0`, the MEX of the prefix `p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]` must be `p[i] + a[i]`, and `p[i]` must be `abs(arr[i] - minn)`.
       - It updates `maxx` if the new value in `mex` exceeds the current `maxx`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the constructed permutation `mex` for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the construction of the permutation based on the given rules.
   - It ensures that the MEX calculation and the permutation values are consistent with the input array `a`.
   - The program also ensures that the values in `mex` are unique and cover the range from 0 to `n-1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where `n = 1` correctly. For `n = 1`, the only possible value in `a` is 0, and the only possible permutation is `[0]`.
   - It should handle the case where all elements in `a` are positive or all are negative correctly. The logic for positive and negative elements is implemented correctly, ensuring that the permutation is constructed correctly in both scenarios.

However, there are a few issues with the original assessment and the program:

- **Function Definition**: The original assessment mentions that the function should be defined as `def construct_permutation(t, test_cases):`, but the actual function is defined as `def func_1():`. This discrepancy does not affect the correctness of the program as it stands, but it is worth noting for clarity and consistency.
- **Variable Naming**: The variable `mex` is used to store the constructed permutation, which is a bit misleading since it is not the MEX values but the permutation itself. This could be renamed to something like `perm` for clarity.
- **Logic for Negative Values**: The logic for handling negative values in `arr` is incorrect. Specifically, the line `mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))` does not correctly compute the permutation value. The correct value should be `p[i] = MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - a[i]`, which means `p[i] = minn - a[i]` (since `minn` is the current MEX). The `abs` function should not be used here.

Given these issues, the program is not correct. The logic for handling negative values in `arr` needs to be fixed.

Corrected Code:
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    maxx = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            minn += 1
            if minn == maxx:
                minn = maxx + 1
        else:
            mex.append(minn - arr[i])
            if minn - arr[i] > maxx:
                maxx = minn - arr[i]
        
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
    print()
```

Final: **False**
