Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to construct the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Instead, it calculates a list `mex` which is intended to represent the MEX values, but it does not directly construct the permutation `p`. The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is also flawed and does not correctly reflect the MEX calculation as described in the problem statement.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:
1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` does not match the intended function `construct_permutation(t, test_cases)`. It reads input directly, which is not a good practice for a function that should handle multiple test cases.
2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX calculation in the loop is incorrect. The MEX of a sequence should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the sequence. The current logic does not ensure that `mex` correctly represents the MEX values based on the permutation `p`.
3. **Permutation Construction**: The program does not construct the permutation `p` at all. It only prints the MEX values, which are not the same as the permutation `p`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, read `n` and the array `a`.
3. Construct the permutation `p` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` for each `i`.
4. Print the permutation `p` for each test case.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
