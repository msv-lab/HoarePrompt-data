Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical error in its approach to constructing the permutation `p` from the array `a`. The MEX (Minimum EXcludant) operation is not being correctly utilized to ensure that the constructed permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The program attempts to build the MEX list by appending values based on whether `arr[i]` is positive or negative. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the MEX operation.
   - The MEX of a prefix of the permutation should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the prefix. The program does not maintain a set or list of seen integers to correctly compute the MEX.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Negative Values**:
   - When `arr[i]` is negative, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to the MEX list. This does not ensure that the MEX is correctly calculated or that the permutation `p` will satisfy the given condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
- Maintain a set of seen integers to compute the MEX for each prefix.
- Use the MEX and the value of `a_i` to correctly determine `p_i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_mex(seen):
    mex = 0
    while mex in seen:
        mex += 1
    return mex

for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    seen = set()
    p = []
    for i in range(n):
        mex = find_mex(seen)
        p_i = mex - arr[i]
        p.append(p_i)
        seen.add(p_i)
    print(' '.join(map(str, p)))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **find_mex(seen)**: This function returns the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the set `seen`.
- **seen**: A set to keep track of the integers that have been used in the permutation `p`.
- **p**: The list to store the permutation.
- For each element `arr[i]`:
  - Compute the MEX of the current prefix using `find_mex(seen)`.
  - Calculate `p_i` as `mex - arr[i]`.
  - Add `p_i` to the permutation `p` and mark it as seen.
- Finally, print the permutation `p`.

This approach ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly and satisfies the given condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
