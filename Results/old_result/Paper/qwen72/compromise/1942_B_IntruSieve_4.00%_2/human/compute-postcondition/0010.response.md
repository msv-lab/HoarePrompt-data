The function `construct_permutation` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case, if the list `a` can be rearranged to form a permutation of the first `n` positive integers, the function returns "Yes" for that test case. Otherwise, it returns "No".

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. The function returns a list of strings, where each string is "Yes" if the list `a` can be rearranged to form a permutation of the first `n` positive integers, or "No" otherwise.**
