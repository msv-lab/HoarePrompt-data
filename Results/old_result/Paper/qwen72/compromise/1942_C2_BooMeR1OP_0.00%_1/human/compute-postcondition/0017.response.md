The function `func_1` should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. However, the function definition provided is not properly defined to include these parameters. Assuming the correct function definition is:
```
def func_1(n, x, y, vertices):
```
The function returns a list of integers representing the vertices that meet certain criteria based on the inputs `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list `vertices`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a list of integers representing the vertices that meet certain criteria based on the inputs.**
