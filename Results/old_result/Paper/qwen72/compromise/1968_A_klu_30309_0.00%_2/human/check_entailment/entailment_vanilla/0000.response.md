### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and calls the function `func_1(x)` to find the optimal \( y \).

3. **Function `func_1(x)`:**
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) but \( 2 * y < x \), it updates `max_val` to \( y \).
   - After the loop, it returns `max_val`.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function correctly iterates over possible values of \( y \) in descending order.
   - The condition \( x \% y == 0 \) ensures that \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is used to find the largest \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. This is because if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2 * y \).
   - If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), the function returns the largest divisor found, which is the next best option to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For \( x = 3 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For larger values of \( x \), the function will find the largest \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \) and satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \) if possible, or the largest divisor otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given \( x \). The logic and implementation are sound and handle the edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
