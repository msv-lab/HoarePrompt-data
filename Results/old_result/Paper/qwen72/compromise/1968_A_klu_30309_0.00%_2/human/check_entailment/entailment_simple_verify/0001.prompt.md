You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and calls the function `func_1(x)` to find the optimal \( y \).

3. **Function `func_1(x)`:**
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) but \( 2 * y < x \), it updates `max_val` to \( y \).
   - After the loop, it returns `max_val`.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function correctly iterates over possible values of \( y \) in descending order.
   - The condition \( x \% y == 0 \) ensures that \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is used to find the largest \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. This is because if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2 * y \).
   - If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), the function returns the largest divisor found, which is the next best option to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For \( x = 3 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For larger values of \( x \), the function will find the largest \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \) and satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \) if possible, or the largest divisor otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly finds the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given \( x \). The logic and implementation are sound and handle the edge cases appropriately.
