### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) is the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and calls the function `func_1(x)` to find the optimal \( y \).

3. **Function `func_1(x)`:**
   - The function initializes `max_val` to 1.
   - It iterates over possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 2.
   - For each \( y \), it checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) (i.e., \( x \% y == 0 \)).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) and \( 2 * y \ge x \), it immediately returns \( y \).
   - If \( x \) is divisible by \( y \) but \( 2 * y < x \), it updates `max_val` to \( y \).
   - After the loop, it returns `max_val`.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function correctly iterates over possible values of \( y \) in descending order.
   - The condition \( x \% y == 0 \) ensures that \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \).
   - The condition \( 2 * y \ge x \) is used to find the largest \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2 * y \). This is because if \( y \) is a divisor of \( x \), then \( \gcd(x, y) = y \), and \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2 * y \).
   - If no \( y \) satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \), the function returns the largest divisor found, which is the next best option to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For \( x = 3 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( \gcd(3, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is correct.
   - For larger values of \( x \), the function will find the largest \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \) and satisfies \( 2 * y \ge x \) if possible, or the largest divisor otherwise.

6. **Challenging the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the function correctly finds the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - However, the function `func_1` does not always return the correct \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). It only returns the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge x \) if it exists, or the largest divisor otherwise.
   - This approach may not always yield the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). For example, consider \( x = 10 \):
     - The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5.
     - The function will return 5 because \( 2 * 5 = 10 \ge 10 \).
     - However, \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \), which is correct.
     - But for \( x = 15 \):
       - The divisors of 15 are 1, 3, 5.
       - The function will return 5 because \( 2 * 5 = 10 < 15 \).
       - However, \( \gcd(15, 5) + 5 = 10 \), which is not the maximum possible value.
       - The maximum value is \( \gcd(15, 3) + 3 = 6 \).

### Conclusion:
The program does not always find the \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). The logic in `func_1` is flawed in that it only considers the largest divisor \( y \) such that \( 2 * y \ge x \) if it exists, or the largest divisor otherwise, which may not be the optimal \( y \).
