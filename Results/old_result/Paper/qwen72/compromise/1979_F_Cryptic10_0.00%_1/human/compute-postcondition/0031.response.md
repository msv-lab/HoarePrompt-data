To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head, which are `d` and `n`.

1. **Variable `d`**: The loop initializes `d` to `n - 1` and decrements `d` by 1 until it reaches -1. For the loop to execute at least once, `d` must start at a value that is greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, `n - 1` must be greater than or equal to 0, which means `n` must be at least 1.

2. **Variable `n`**: The state before the loop specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\). This condition already ensures that `n` is at least 2, which is sufficient for `d` to start at a value greater than or equal to 0.

Given these conditions, the loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 2. The variable `d` will start at `n - 1`, which is at least 1, and will decrement until it reaches -1.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. The variable `d` should be initialized to `n - 1`, and `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is `n - 1`**
