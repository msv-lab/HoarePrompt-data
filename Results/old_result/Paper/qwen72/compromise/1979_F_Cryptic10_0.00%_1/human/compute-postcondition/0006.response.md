Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive), `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`, and the current value of `v` is 0. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
