Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive), `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**. 

The values of `v` and `u` are determined by the function `func_1(d)`, and they are now assigned the results of this function. The other variables remain unchanged.
