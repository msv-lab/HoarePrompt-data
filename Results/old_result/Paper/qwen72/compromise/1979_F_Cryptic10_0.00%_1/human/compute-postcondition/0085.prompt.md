Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except the value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one element. `d` is 0
Code of the loop:
for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
    v, u = func_1(d)
    if v == 0:
        continue
    if v in remaining_vertices:
        path.append(v)
        remaining_vertices.remove(v)
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the loop continues with the current values of `v` and `u`. If `v` is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list. We have exited the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 2`, and `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is 0, the current iteration of the loop is skipped, and the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` are not affected. If `v` is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list, and the `path` list now includes `v` as its last element, with `v` no longer in the `remaining_vertices` list. If `v` is not in the `remaining_vertices` list, the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `d` is `n - 3`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. If `v` is not 0 and is in the `remaining_vertices` list, `v` is appended to the `path` list and removed from the `remaining_vertices` list, with `v` as the last element of `path` and `v` no longer in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0 or was not in the `remaining_vertices` list, the states of `path` and `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged. In all cases, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
