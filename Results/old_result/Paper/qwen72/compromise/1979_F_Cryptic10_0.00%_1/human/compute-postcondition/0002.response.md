The only object in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `remaining_vertices` is non-empty. Right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive), where `n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Since `n` is at least 2, `remaining_vertices` will always contain at least one element (i.e., it will not be empty), ensuring that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive)**
