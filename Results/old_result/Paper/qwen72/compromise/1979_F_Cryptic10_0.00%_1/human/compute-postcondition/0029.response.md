Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. `d` is 0.**

### Explanation:
- **`n`**: The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
- **`path`**: The `path` list can contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0. This is because the loop breaks as soon as it finds a non-zero `v` that is in `remaining_vertices`.
- **`remaining_vertices`**: The `remaining_vertices` set will contain all integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except the value `v` that was added to `path` if such a `v` was found and was not 0.
- **`d`**: The loop iterates from `n - 1` down to 0. After all iterations, `d` will be 0.
