Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, `d` is `n - 1`, `path` is a list containing the value `v`, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n (inclusive), `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`. The current value of `v` is in `remaining_vertices`. If `v` is 0, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- The value `v` is appended to the list `path`.
- The other variables (`n`, `d`, `remaining_vertices`, `u`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `v` is in `remaining_vertices` and the behavior if `v` is 0 are still valid.
