Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\), `path` is a list that may contain at most one value `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) except `v` if `v` was in `remaining_vertices` and `v` is not 0, and `remaining_vertices` must not be empty, `d` is `n - 1`, `v` and `u` are the values returned by `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation:
- The value of `n` remains a non-negative integer within the specified range.
- The list `path` and the set `remaining_vertices` remain unchanged in their structure and content.
- The variable `d` remains `n - 1`.
- The variables `v` and `u` are assigned the values returned by the function `func_1(d)`. The specific values of `v` and `u` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are now part of the output state.
