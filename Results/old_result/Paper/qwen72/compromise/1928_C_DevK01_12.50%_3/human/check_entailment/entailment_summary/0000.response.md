### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the number of possible values for `k` given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers from 1 to `k`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given `n` and `x`, the value of `k` must satisfy the condition that `x` appears at position `n` in the settling pattern.
   - The position `n` can be expressed as `n = (2k - 2) * m + p`, where `m` is a non-negative integer and `p` is the position within the first `2k - 2` positions.
   - The number `x` can appear in two possible positions within the first `2k - 2` positions: either in the first `k` positions or in the next `k - 2` positions.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is odd. If `y` is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it calculates `q = (y - 2) // 2` and calls `func_1(q, x)` to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and, if true, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional divisors.
   - The results from both calls to `func_1` are combined, converted to a set to remove duplicates, and the length of the set is printed as the answer.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(q, x)` returns a list of divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first checks if `q` is a perfect square and if the square root is greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to the list.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `q` and checks if they are divisors of `q`. If they are, and if they meet the condition `i >= x - 1` or `q // i >= x - 1`, they are added to the list.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd by printing 0, as an odd `y` implies that no valid `k` exists.
   - The calculation of `q` and the use of `func_1` to find divisors is logically sound.
   - The additional check for `n >= 3 * x - 2` and the second call to `func_1` ensures that all possible `k` values are considered.
   - The use of a set to remove duplicates and the final length calculation are appropriate for counting unique `k` values.
