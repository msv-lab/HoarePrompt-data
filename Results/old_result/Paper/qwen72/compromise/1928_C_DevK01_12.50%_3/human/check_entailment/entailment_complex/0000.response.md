Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if the sum `y = n + x` is odd. If it is, the program prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because for the settling to be valid, `n + x` must be even. This is because the settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and for `x` to be a valid number in the settling pattern, `n + x` must align with this periodicity.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1` with the arguments `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`. This transformation is correct because it converts the problem into finding divisors of a specific value that can fit the settling pattern.

4. **Divisor Calculation**: The function `func_1` calculates the divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This is done by iterating up to the square root of `q` and checking both the divisor and the quotient. This is a standard and efficient way to find divisors of a number.

5. **Additional Check**: If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, the program calls `func_1` again with the arguments `(n - x) // 2` and `x`. This additional check is necessary because the settling pattern can also be valid for `n - x` in certain cases, and the function `func_1` is used to find the valid `k` values for this case as well.

6. **Set Conversion and Length Calculation**: The program converts the list `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then prints the length of the set. This is correct because it ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n + x` is odd, or when no valid `k` can be found.

8. **Output**: The program outputs the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints, which is the correct output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
