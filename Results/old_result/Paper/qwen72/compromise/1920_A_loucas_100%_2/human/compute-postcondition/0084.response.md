Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` is greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `big` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 1, `less` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 2, `no` is a list containing all values of `a` where `x` was 3, and the current value of `num` is less than 1.**
