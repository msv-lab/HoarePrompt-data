Postcondition: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0, `num` is 0, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `a` is an input integer where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. If `x` is 1, `big` is a list containing the value of `a`, `less` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is 2, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, `big` and `no` are empty lists. If `x` is not 1 or 2, `less` and `big` are empty lists, and `no` is a list containing the value of `a`.**
