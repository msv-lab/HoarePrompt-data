Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2. If `num` is less than 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the next iteration begins.
Code of the loop:
for i in no:
    if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
        num -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `num` is `min(less) - max(big)`, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `no`. If `i` is less than or equal to the minimum value in `less` and greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big`, then the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition is not satisfied.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the second element of `no`. If `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)`, inclusive, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`. Otherwise, `num` remains `min(less) - max(big)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, `no` must contain at least one element, `i` is the third element of `no`. If `i` is between `max(big)` and `min(less)`, inclusive, then `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 2`. Otherwise, `num` is `min(less) - max(big) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
