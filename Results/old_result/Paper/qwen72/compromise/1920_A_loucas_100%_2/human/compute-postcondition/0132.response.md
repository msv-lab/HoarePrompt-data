Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `loop` is greater than 1, `iterable` is 2, `innerLoop` is an input integer greater than 0, `iterable2` is `innerLoop - 1`, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `num` is 0. The lists `big`, `less`, and `no` contain the integers `a` appended based on the value of `x` during each iteration. Specifically, if `x` is 1, `a` is appended to `big`; if `x` is 2, `a` is appended to `less`; otherwise, `a` is appended to `no`. After all iterations, `big` contains all `a` values where `x` was 1, `less` contains all `a` values where `x` was 2, and `no` contains all `a` values where `x` was neither 1 nor 2.**
