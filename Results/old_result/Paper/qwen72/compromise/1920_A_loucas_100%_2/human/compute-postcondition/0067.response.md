Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, each test case has constraints (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `loop` must be greater than 1, `iterable` is 1, `innerLoop` must be greater than 0, `iterable2` is 0, `x` is the last integer from the input, `a` is the last integer from the input, `num` is 0. If `x` is 1, `big` is [1], `less` is an empty list, and `no` is an empty list. If `x` is 2, `big` is an empty list, `less` is a list containing the value of `a`, and `no` is an empty list. Otherwise, `big` is an empty list, `less` is an empty list, and `no` contains the value of `a`.***
