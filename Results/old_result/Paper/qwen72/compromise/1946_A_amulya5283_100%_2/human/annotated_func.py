#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: `t` is 0, and all test cases have been processed. For each test case, `n` was an input integer, `a` was a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `mdx` was set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `res` was the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. If `n` was 1, the function printed 1. If `n` was greater than 1, the function printed the value of `res`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers from the user. It sorts the array `a` and then calculates the number of elements from the middle index to the end of the array that are equal to the element at the middle index. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the calculated count. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0, and all test cases have been processed.
