Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus the number of iterations and is still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer and is greater than or equal to `mdx`, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.**

In natural language, after the loop has finished executing all its iterations:
- The value of `t` is reduced by the number of iterations the loop has executed, and it is still greater than 0.
- The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- The list `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user.
- The value of `mdx` remains `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- The value of `i` is now `n`, as the loop has iterated from `mdx` to `n-1`.
- The value of `res` is the count of elements in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to the element at index `mdx`.
