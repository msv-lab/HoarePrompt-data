Postcondition: ***`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is set to 2. Otherwise, `res` remains 0.***
