Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

Explanation:
- `a` is now assigned the value of a list of integers provided by the user input, and it is sorted.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `mdx`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged, but `a` is updated to reflect the new list of integers.
