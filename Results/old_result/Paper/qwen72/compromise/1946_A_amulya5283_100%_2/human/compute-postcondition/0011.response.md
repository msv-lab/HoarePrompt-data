To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and expressions in the loop head, which are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`.

1. **`i`**: This variable is initialized by the `range` function and will start at `mdx`.
2. **`mdx`**: This is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. Given that `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` will be a valid integer.
3. **`n`**: This is the upper limit of the `range` function and must be greater than `mdx` for the loop to execute at least once.

Let's break it down:

- **`n` is greater than 1**: This ensures that `mdx` is a valid index.
- **`mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`**: This means `mdx` will be the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or one less than the middle index if `n` is even.
- **`i` starts at `mdx`**: The loop will iterate from `mdx` to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `mdx` must be less than `n`. Given the calculation of `mdx`, this will always be true as long as `n` is greater than 1.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute:

State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `res` is 0, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` starts at `mdx`**
