Output State: **`t` is the previous value of `t` minus 1 and still greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user input, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n`, `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**

The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `mdx`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged. The list `a` is now sorted, but the specific values of the elements in `a` are not provided, so we only note that `a` is now a sorted list of `n` integers.
