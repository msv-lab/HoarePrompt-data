The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` was 0 if `a[mdx]` was not equal to `a[i]`, or 1 if `a[mdx]` was equal to `a[i]`. Therefore, the new value of `res` will be 1 if `a[mdx]` was not equal to `a[i]`, or 2 if `a[mdx]` was equal to `a[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, `t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `res` is 2. Otherwise, `res` is 1.**
