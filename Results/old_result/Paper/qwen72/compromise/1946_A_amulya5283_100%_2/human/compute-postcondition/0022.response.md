Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases.
2. `t` is an input integer minus 1.
3. `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
4. `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user.
5. `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
6. `i` is `n`.
7. `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `mdx`**:
   - `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
   - `n // 2` gives the integer division of `n` by 2.
   - `n % 2` gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 2.
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` is 0, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2 - 1`.
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` is 1, so `mdx` becomes `n // 2`.

2. **Understanding `res`**:
   - `res` counts the number of elements in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.
   - This means we are counting the occurrences of the element at index `mdx` in the sublist `a[mdx:n]`.

### Example Calculation:
- Suppose `n = 5` (an odd number):
  - `mdx = 5 // 2 + 5 % 2 - 1 = 2 + 1 - 1 = 2`.
  - The sublist `a[mdx:n]` is `a[2:5]`.
  - `res` will count how many times `a[2]` appears in `a[2:5]`.

- Suppose `n = 6` (an even number):
  - `mdx = 6 // 2 + 6 % 2 - 1 = 3 + 0 - 1 = 2`.
  - The sublist `a[mdx:n]` is `a[2:6]`.
  - `res` will count how many times `a[2]` appears in `a[2:6]`.

### General Case:
- For any `n`, `mdx` will be the middle index of the list `a` (if `n` is odd) or the first of the two middle indices (if `n` is even).
- `res` will count the occurrences of `a[mdx]` in the sublist `a[mdx:n]`.

### Output:
The `print(res)` statement will print the number of elements in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of elements in the list `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`)**
