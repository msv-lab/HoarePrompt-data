Postcondition: ***`func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an input integer minus 1, and `n` is an input integer. `a` is now a sorted list of `n` integers provided by the user. If `n` is 1, the function processes the single-element array. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n-1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.***
