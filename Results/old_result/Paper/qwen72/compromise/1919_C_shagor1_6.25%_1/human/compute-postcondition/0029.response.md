Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the condition in the previous iteration), `y` is equal to `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is now equal to the value of `a`, which is the third element of the list `inp`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `inp`, `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
