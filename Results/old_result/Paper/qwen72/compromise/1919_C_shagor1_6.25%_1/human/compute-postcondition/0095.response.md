The only objects in the loop head are the variable `a` and the list `inp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `inp`. If `inp` has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `inp` must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`, and `_` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `inp` must have at least 3 elements, and `a` will be the third element of `inp`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`. If `a` ≤ `x`, `ans` is 0 if the third element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1. If `a` > `x`, `ans` is 1 if the third element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2.**
