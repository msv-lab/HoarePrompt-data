Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `y` is the third element of `inp`, `ans` is 0 if the third element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1 if `a` ≤ `x`, or `ans` is 1 if the third element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `a` > `x`.**
