Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is 0 or 1 (depending on the condition in the previous iteration), and `x` is the second element of `inp`.**
