Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
2. `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
3. `_` is 1.
4. `inp` is a new list of integers from the input.
5. `a` is the last element of `inp`.
6. `x` is the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to the initial `x` (which is `n + 1`).
7. `y` is the smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` and less than or equal to the initial `y` (which is `n + 1`).
8. `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y` after all iterations.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` is initialized to `n + 1`.
   - `y` is also initialized to `n + 1`.

2. **Finding `x` and `y` in `inp`:**
   - `x` is set to the smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `y` is set to the smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Counting elements greater than both `x` and `y`:**
   - `ans` is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Explanation of Variables:
- **`x`**: The smallest element in `inp` that is less than or equal to `n + 1`.
- **`y`**: The smallest element in `inp` that is greater than `x` and less than or equal to `n + 1`.
- **`ans`**: The number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

### Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`.

Since the exact values of `inp` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of elements in `inp` that are greater than both `x` and `y`)**
