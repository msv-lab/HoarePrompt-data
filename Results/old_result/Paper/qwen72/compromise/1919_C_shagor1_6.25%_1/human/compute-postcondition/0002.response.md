The code snippet `*inp, = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, converts each part to an integer, and assigns these integers to the list `inp`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n
- `_` is 0
- The input to the loop is `t` which must be at least 1

The code snippet affects the variable `inp` by assigning it the list of integers from the input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `_`) are not directly affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input.**
