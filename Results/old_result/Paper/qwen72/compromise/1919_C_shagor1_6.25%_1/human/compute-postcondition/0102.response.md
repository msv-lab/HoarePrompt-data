Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, and `x` is a fixed integer. If `a` ≤ `x` and the third element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, `ans` is 0. If `a` ≤ `x` and the third element of `inp` > `n + 1`, `ans` is 1. If `a` > `x` and the third element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, `ans` is 1. If `a` > `x` and the third element of `inp` > `n + 1`, `ans` is 2.***
