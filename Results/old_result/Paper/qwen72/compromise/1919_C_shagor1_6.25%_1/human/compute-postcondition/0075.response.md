The only objects in the loop head are the variable `a` and the list `inp`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `inp`. If `inp` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is the last element of `inp`, but for the loop to execute, `a` should be the first element of `inp` in the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `a` is the first element of `inp`, `x` is `n + 1`, `y` is `n + 1`, `ans` is 0**
