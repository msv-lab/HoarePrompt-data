Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `_` is 0, `inp` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is 1 or 2 (depending on the condition in the previous iteration), `y` is equal to `a`.** 

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
