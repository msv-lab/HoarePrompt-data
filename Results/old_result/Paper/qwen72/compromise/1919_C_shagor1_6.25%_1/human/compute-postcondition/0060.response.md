The only objects in the loop head are the list `inp` and the variable `a`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `inp` must have at least one more element, and `a` must be set to the next element in the list.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `_` is 1.
- `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements.
- `a` is the second element of `inp`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `inp` must have at least 3 elements.
- `a` must be the third element of `inp`.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 1, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`.**
