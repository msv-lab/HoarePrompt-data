Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 2, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `a` is the third element of `inp`, `x` is the third element of `inp`, `ans` is 0 if the third element of `inp` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `ans` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated to be the same as the value of `a`, which is the third element of `inp`.
- The conditions for `ans` remain the same: if the third element of `inp` (which is now also `x`) is less than or equal to `n + 1`, then `ans` is 0; otherwise, `ans` is 1.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `_`, and `inp` remain unchanged.
- The value of `a` is still the third element of `inp`.
