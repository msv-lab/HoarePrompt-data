The code snippet `x == y` is a comparison that checks if the values of `x` and `y` are equal. This comparison does not change the values of `x` or `y`, but it evaluates to a boolean value (`True` or `False`). The boolean result of this comparison is not stored in any variable, so the state of the program remains unchanged except for the fact that this comparison has been evaluated.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5
- `_` is 1
- `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements
- `a` is the second element of `inp`
- `x` is `n + 1` if `a` > `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is equal to `a`
- `y` is `n + 1` if `a` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is equal to `a`
- If `a` ≤ `n + 1`, `ans` is 0
- If `a` > `n + 1` and `a` ≤ `y`, `ans` is 0
- Otherwise, `ans` is 1

The comparison `x == y` will evaluate to:
- `True` if `a` ≤ `n + 1` (since both `x` and `y` will be equal to `a`)
- `False` if `a` > `n + 1` (since `x` will be `a` and `y` will be `n + 1`)

Since the comparison does not change any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `_` is 1, `inp` is a new list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `inp`, `x` is `n + 1` if `a` > `n + 1`, otherwise `x` is equal to `a`, `y` is `n + 1` if `a` ≤ `n + 1`, otherwise `y` is equal to `a`, `ans` is 0 if `a` ≤ `n + 1` or if `a` > `n + 1` and `a` ≤ `y`, otherwise `ans` is 1.**
