Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
   - No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
   - For every integer `v` in the range `[1, n]` except `k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` using a loop.
   - It constructs the sequence `ans` with specific elements:
     - `k - (1 << i)` ensures that the sequence does not have a subsequence summing to `k`.
     - `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` are added to ensure that the sequence can form sums close to `k` but not exactly `k`.
     - It appends all powers of 2 up to `2^19` except `2^i` to the sequence to ensure that all other sums can be formed.

3. **Verification**:
   - The sequence `ans` is constructed to avoid a subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing elements.
   - The inclusion of powers of 2 ensures that all other sums can be formed, as any number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2.
   - The size of the sequence is at most 25, which meets the problem's constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the sequence avoids the sum `k` while covering all other required sums.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
