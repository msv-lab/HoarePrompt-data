Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input by the user where 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `tc` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq k\), `ans` is a list containing the values `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`. If `j` is not equal to `i`, `ans` is extended to include the value `1`, and `j` remains 0.***
