The code snippet `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the new input.

Let's break down the impact of this code:

- `n` and `k` are both reassigned to new values read from the input.
- The initial values of `n` and `k` are no longer relevant after this assignment.
- The values of `t`, `tc`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `tc` is 2.
- `n` remains an integer input by the user.
- `k` is unchanged.
- `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\).
- `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` concatenated with all powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).

After executing the code:
- `n` and `k` are updated to the new values read from the input.
- The values of `t`, `tc`, `i`, and `ans` remain the same.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` is 2, `n` is an integer input by the user, `k` is an integer input by the user, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), and `ans` is `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]` concatenated with all powers of 2 from 1 to \(2^{19}\) except \(2^i\).**
