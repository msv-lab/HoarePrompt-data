To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the current state:

### Current State:
- `k` is an integer input by the user (at least 2).
- `i` is increased by 1.

### Loop Condition:
```python
while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
```

### Analysis:
- The loop condition checks if `1 << (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `1 << (i + 1)` is equivalent to `2 ** (i + 1)`, which means the loop continues as long as `2 ** (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `k`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Current State of `i`**: After the previous iteration, `i` has been increased by 1. Let's denote the value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration as `i_new = i_old + 1`.
2. **Loop Condition Check**: For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `1 << (i_new + 1) <= k` must be true.
   - Substituting `i_new = i_old + 1` into the condition, we get `1 << ((i_old + 1) + 1) <= k`, which simplifies to `1 << (i_old + 2) <= k`.
   - This means `2 ** (i_old + 2) <= k` must be true for the loop to execute again.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `i`.
- Since `i` is already increased by 1, no further adjustment to `i` is needed.
- The condition `1 << (i + 1) <= k` must still hold true for the loop to execute one more time.

### Conclusion:
Since `i` is already increased by 1, and the condition `1 << (i + 1) <= k` must still hold true, the state remains the same.

State: **`k` is an integer input by the user (at least 2), `i` is increased by 1**
