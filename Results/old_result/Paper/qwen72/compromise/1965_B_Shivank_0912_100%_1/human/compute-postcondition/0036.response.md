The code snippet updates the list `ans` by setting it to a new list containing three elements: `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`. This overwrites the previous contents of `ans`.

- `k - (1 << i)` calculates the value of `k` minus \(2^i\).
- `k + 1` simply adds 1 to `k`.
- `k + 1 + (1 << i)` calculates the value of `k + 1` plus \(2^i\).

The other variables (`t`, `tc`, `n`, `k`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` remains an integer input by the user where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `tc` remains 1, `n` remains an integer input by the user, `k` is unchanged, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i+1} \leq k\), and `ans` is now `[k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]`.**
