Output State: **`k` is an integer input by the user (at least 2), `i` is increased by 3, and `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << (i + 2)`**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so if it was previously increased by 2, it is now increased by 3.
- The condition `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << (i + 3)` from the initial state is updated to `k` must be greater than or equal to `1 << (i + 2)` because `i` is now one more than its previous value.
