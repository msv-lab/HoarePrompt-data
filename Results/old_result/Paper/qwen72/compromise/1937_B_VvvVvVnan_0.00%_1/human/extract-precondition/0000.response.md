Precondition: **The function `func_1` should accept parameters to represent the input, but based on the provided function definition, it does not. For the problem to be correctly addressed, the function should accept parameters such as the number of test cases `t`, the integer `n` representing the width of the grid, and two binary strings `a1` and `a2` representing the two rows of the grid.** 

However, to provide a more accurate precondition, the function definition should be updated to reflect the actual inputs required for the problem:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing an integer `n` and two binary strings `a1` and `a2`.

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case is a tuple (n, a1, a2) where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and a1, a2 are binary strings of length n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
