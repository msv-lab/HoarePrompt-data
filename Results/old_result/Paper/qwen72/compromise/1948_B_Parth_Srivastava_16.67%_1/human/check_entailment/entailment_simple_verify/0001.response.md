### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `c` to store the transformed array and a counter `n` to keep track of the length of `c`.
   - It iterates through each element of the array `a` and applies the transformation logic.

3. **Transforming the Array**:
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is not the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if the first digit `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c` and if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - If not, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is greater than 10 and it is the first element, it splits the element into its digits `x` and `y`.
     - It checks if `y` is less than or equal to `x`.
     - If true, it appends `y` and `x` to `c`.
     - If not, it appends the original element to `c`.
   - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends the element to `c`.

4. **Checking Sorted Order**:
   - After transforming the array, the function sorts the transformed array `c` and checks if it is equal to the original transformed array.
   - If they are equal, it appends `1` to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - If they are not equal, it appends `0` to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program iterates through the list `b` and prints 'YES' for each `1` and 'NO' for each `0`.

### Analysis:
- The program's logic for transforming the array is correct in terms of splitting elements greater than 10 into their digits and inserting them in the correct order.
- However, the final check to determine if the array can be sorted is flawed. The program only checks if the transformed array `c` is equal to its sorted version `d`. This is not sufficient because the transformation should ensure that the array can be made non-decreasing, not just that it is already sorted.

### Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `12 3 45 67`
  - Transformed: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `12 28 5`
  - Transformed: `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 2, 2, 5, 8]`
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `0 0`
  - Transformed: `[0, 0]`
  - Sorted: `[0, 0]`
  - Output: `YES` (Correct)

### Additional Test Case:
- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `15 23 8 34 12`
  - Transformed: `[1, 5, 23, 8, 34, 12]`
  - Sorted: `[1, 5, 8, 12, 23, 34]`
  - Output: `NO` (Incorrect)
  - **Explanation**: The transformed array `[1, 5, 23, 8, 34, 12]` cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of operations, but the program incorrectly outputs `NO` because it only checks if the transformed array is equal to its sorted version.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for transforming the array is correct, but the final check to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing is flawed. The program should check if the transformed array can be made non-decreasing, not just if it is already sorted.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
