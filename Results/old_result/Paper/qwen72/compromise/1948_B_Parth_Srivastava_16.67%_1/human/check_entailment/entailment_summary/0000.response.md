### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Structure:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m`.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the results of each test case.
   - It iterates over the number of test cases, calling `func_1` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `k` and the array `a`.
   - It processes each element of the array `a`:
     - If the element is greater than 10 and not the first element, it breaks it down into its tens and units digits.
     - It checks if the tens digit is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c` and if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit.
     - If both conditions are met, it appends the tens and units digits to `c`.
     - If the conditions are not met, it appends the original element to `c`.
     - If the element is the first element and greater than 10, it breaks it down and appends the digits to `c` if the tens digit is less than or equal to the units digit.
     - If the element is less than or equal to 10, it appends it directly to `c`.

3. **Sorting and Checking:**
   - After processing all elements, the function sorts the list `c` and checks if it is equal to the original list `c`.
   - If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b` (indicating the array can be sorted).
   - Otherwise, it appends 0 to the list `b` (indicating the array cannot be sorted).

4. **Output:**
   - After all test cases are processed, the program iterates over the list `b` and prints 'YES' for 1 and 'NO' for 0.

### Issues and Edge Cases:
- **Incorrect Handling of Digits:**
  - The function `func_1` only appends the tens and units digits in a specific order if the conditions are met. However, it should always append the digits in the order they appear in the original number, regardless of the conditions.
  - For example, if the array is `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the function should transform it to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and then check if it is sorted.

- **Incorrect Logic for First Element:**
  - The function has a special case for the first element, but it should always break down the first element if it is greater than 10, regardless of the order of the digits.

- **Redundant Counting:**
  - The variable `n` is used to count the elements in `c`, but this is unnecessary since `len(c)` can be used directly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues and edge cases identified, the program does not correctly handle the transformation of elements greater than 10 and the sorting check. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
