Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 50) and a list `a` of `n` integers (where 0 <= a_i <= 99). It modifies the list `a` by breaking down integers greater than 10 into their tens and units digits, appending these digits to a new list `c` in a specific order, and then appends the original integer if the condition is not met. The function also maintains a count `n` of the elements in `c`. After processing, it sorts the list `c` and checks if the sorted list `d` is equal to `c`. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`; otherwise, it appends 0. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the list `b` to indicate whether the processed list `c` is sorted. **
