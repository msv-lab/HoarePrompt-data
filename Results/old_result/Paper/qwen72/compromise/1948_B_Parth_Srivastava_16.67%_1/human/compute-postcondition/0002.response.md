Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of integers, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` converts the string `a` into a list of integers by splitting the string at whitespace and converting each resulting substring into an integer. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
