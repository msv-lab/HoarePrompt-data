Reasoning:  
The program aims to find a way to distribute the coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. The approach taken by the program is to calculate the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then for each multiplier, compute the bet as `prod` divided by that multiplier. This results in a list `vprod` where each element is the bet for the corresponding outcome. The sum of all bets is then subtracted from `prod` to get `den`. If `den` is less than or equal to 0, it means that the total amount bet is not strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome, and the program prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the bets.

However, this approach has a critical flaw. The product of all multipliers (`prod`) can become extremely large, especially when the number of outcomes is high and the multipliers are large. This can lead to integer overflow or very large numbers that are not practical for the problem constraints. Additionally, the condition `den > 0` does not guarantee that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome. Instead, it should ensure that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for the outcome with the smallest multiplier.

A correct approach would be to find the smallest multiplier and set the bet for that outcome to 1. Then, for each other outcome, set the bet to a value that ensures the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for the smallest multiplier. This can be achieved by setting the bets for other outcomes to 1 and ensuring the total sum of bets is less than the smallest multiplier.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle large products and does not correctly ensure the condition for all outcomes.

Correctness: **False**
