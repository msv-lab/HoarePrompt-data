Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an input integer greater than 2, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 1, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2. If `d[j]` is in `e[k:]` and either `k` is equal to `c` or `j` is equal to `b - 1`, then `k` is set to 3, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. Otherwise, if `d[j]` is not in `e[k:]`, then `k` is set to 2, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
