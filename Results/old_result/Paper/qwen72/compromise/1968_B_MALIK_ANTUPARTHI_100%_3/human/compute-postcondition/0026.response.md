Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 2, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` updates the value of `k`.
- `d[j]` is the value of `d` at index `j`, which is 2.
- `e[k:]` is a slice of the string or list `e` starting from index `k` to the end.
- `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the slice `e[k:]`.
- The new value of `k` is calculated as the index found plus 1, plus the original value of `k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `i`, `d`, `e`, `j`) remain unchanged.
