The only variable in the loop head is `j`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the condition `j < b`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 2, and `b` must still be greater than `j` (i.e., `b` must be greater than 2).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 2, `b` must be greater than 2.**
