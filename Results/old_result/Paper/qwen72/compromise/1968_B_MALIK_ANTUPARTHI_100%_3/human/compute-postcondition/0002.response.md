Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` is an integer, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The code `b, c = map(int, input().split())` reads a line of input, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer, assigning them to `b` and `c` respectively.
- The initial value of `b` as a binary string of length `m` is no longer valid after this assignment, as `b` is now an integer.
- The initial state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `i` remains unchanged.
- The new values of `b` and `c` are integers, but their specific values depend on the input provided.
