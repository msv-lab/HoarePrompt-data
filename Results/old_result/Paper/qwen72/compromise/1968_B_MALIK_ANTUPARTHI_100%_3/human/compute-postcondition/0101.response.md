Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 1, `b` is an input integer greater than 0, `c` is an input integer, `i` is 2, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is the index at which the loop breaks or `b` if the loop completes without breaking, `k` is the index of the last element in `d` that was found in `e` plus 1, or the index at which the loop breaks if no such element is found.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `i`, `d`, and `e` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- The variable `j` will be the index at which the loop breaks, or it will be `b` if the loop completes all iterations without breaking.
- The variable `k` will be the index of the last element in `d` that was found in the slice `e[k:]` plus 1, or it will be the index at which the loop breaks if no such element is found. If the loop completes without breaking and the last element in `d` is found in `e[k:]`, `k` will be set to `b` (since `j` will be `b - 1` and `k` will be set to `j + 1`). If the loop breaks because `k` equals `c` or `d[j]` is not found in `e[k:]`, `k` will be the index at which the loop breaks.
