Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is an input integer greater than 0, `b` must be greater than 1, `c` is an integer, the sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5, `i` is 0, `d` is an input value, `e` is an input value, `j` is 1, `k` is `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `k` is updated to `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k`.
- `e[k:]` slices the string `e` starting from index `k` to the end.
- `d[j]` retrieves the value at index `j` in `d`, which is 1.
- `e[k:].index(d[j])` finds the index of the first occurrence of `d[j]` in the sliced string `e[k:]`.
- `e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k` calculates the new value of `k` by adding the index found, 1, and the original value of `k`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
