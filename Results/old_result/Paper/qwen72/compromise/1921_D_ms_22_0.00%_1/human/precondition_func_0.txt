t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a_i and b_i are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, with the length of a_i being n and the length of b_i being m. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
