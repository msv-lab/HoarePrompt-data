You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, as the loop has iterated `t` times. The variables `L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, but these values are not guaranteed to be consistent across different test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of sale days `n`, the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list `a` of ticket prices for each day. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum cost required to buy exactly `k` tickets over the `n` sale days. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `t` will be 0, and the list `a` will be sorted and potentially modified. The final state of other variables (`L`, `M`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `q`, `N`, `w`, `mu`, and `cost`) will be based on the last test case processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program has a logical error in the way it calculates the cost. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the cost increase for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on previous days. Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Sorting the Prices:**
   The program sorts the list `M` of ticket prices, which is a good start to minimize the cost by buying tickets on the cheapest days first.

2. **Calculating the Number of Days to Buy Tickets:**
   The program calculates `q` as the number of days required to buy all `k` tickets, which is `math.ceil(k / m)`. This is correct.

3. **Selecting the Cheapest Days:**
   The program selects the first `q` days from the sorted list `M` to buy tickets. This is also correct.

4. **Calculating the Cost:**
   The program then calculates the cost in two different ways:
   - If `n * m == k`, it calculates the cost as `m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)`.
   - If `n * m != k`, it calculates the cost as `mu * w + m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu`.

   The issue lies in the way the cost increase due to ticket purchases is handled. The program assumes a uniform increase in cost for all subsequent days, which is not accurate according to the problem description. The cost increase should be applied to each subsequent day based on the number of tickets purchased on the previous day.

**Example Case:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

The program will sort the prices to `[2, 4, 6, 8]` and select the first `q = 2` days. It will then calculate the cost as follows:
- `N = [2, 4]`
- `q = 2`
- `n = 2`
- `m = 2`
- `k = 3`

Since `n * m != k`, it will pop the last element `w = 4` and set `mu = 3 - (2 - 1) * 2 = 1`. The cost calculation will be:
- `cost = 1 * 4 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 2 * ((2 - 1) * (2 - 2) // 2) + 2 * 2 * 1`
- `cost = 4 + 4 + 0 + 4 = 12`

However, the correct minimum cost should be `10`:
- Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are `[6, 4, 2]`.
- Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are `[4, 2]`.
- Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost `4`. The price per ticket for the remaining day is `[3]`.
- Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost `6`.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the cost increase for subsequent days, leading to incorrect results in some cases.
