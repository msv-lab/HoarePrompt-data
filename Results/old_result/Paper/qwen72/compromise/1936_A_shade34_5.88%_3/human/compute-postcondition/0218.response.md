Output State: **`i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>` or remains 0 if no such input was received.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` flushes the output buffer, but it does not change any of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
