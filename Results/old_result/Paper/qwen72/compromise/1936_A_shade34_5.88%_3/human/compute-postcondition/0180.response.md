The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `pans` is a list containing `[0]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, `mak` is 0 if `s` is `<`, otherwise `mak` is set to the highest index for which the user input was `<` if the user input is `<` at any iteration, or remains 0 if no `<` is found, `s` is the user input string, and the output buffer has been flushed.**
