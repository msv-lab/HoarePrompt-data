The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop control variable. The loop will execute based on the result of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The other details about the function's operation, the hidden permutation, and the constraints on `n` and the number of queries are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`_` is the loop control variable, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
