Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`i` is 2**: This is explicitly given.
2. **`n` must be greater than 2**: This is a condition, but it doesn't directly affect the print statement.
3. **`pans` is a list containing `[1]` if `s` is `=`, or `[0, 1]` if `s` is `<`, otherwise `pans` remains an empty list**: This depends on the value of `s`.
4. **`mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`**: This means `mak2` will be the highest index in the `pans` list where `s` is `<`.
5. **`mak` is 1 if `s` is `<`, 0 if `s` is `=`, and remains 0 if no `<` is found**: This directly depends on the value of `s`.
6. **`s` is the user input string**: The value of `s` is not explicitly provided, but it can be either `=`, `<`, or something else.
7. **The output buffer has been flushed**: This is a condition that doesn't affect the print statement.

Now, let's consider the possible values of `s` and their impact on the variables:

- If `s` is `=`:
  - `pans` will be `[1]`.
  - `mak` will be `0`.
  - `mak2` will be `0` (since there is no `<` in `pans`).

- If `s` is `<`:
  - `pans` will be `[0, 1]`.
  - `mak` will be `1`.
  - `mak2` will be `1` (since the highest index for `<` is 1).

- If `s` is something else (e.g., `>`):
  - `pans` will be an empty list `[]`.
  - `mak` will be `0`.
  - `mak2` will be `0` (since there is no `<` in `pans`).

Given the print statement:
```
print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
```

Let's evaluate the output for each case:

- **If `s` is `=`**:
  - `mak` is `0`.
  - `mak2` is `0`.
  - `i` is `2`.
  - `mak2` is `0`.
  - Output: **? 0 0 2 0**

- **If `s` is `<`**:
  - `mak` is `1`.
  - `mak2` is `1`.
  - `i` is `2`.
  - `mak2` is `1`.
  - Output: **? 1 1 2 1**

- **If `s` is something else (e.g., `>`)**:
  - `mak` is `0`.
  - `mak2` is `0`.
  - `i` is `2`.
  - `mak2` is `0`.
  - Output: **? 0 0 2 0**

Since the exact value of `s` is not provided, we need to consider the most general case. However, the output will depend on the value of `s`. Let's provide the most precise description:

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 2 [mak2] (where [mak] is 0 if `s` is `=`, 1 if `s` is `<`, and 0 otherwise, and [mak2] is 0 if `s` is `=`, 1 if `s` is `<`, and 0 otherwise)**
