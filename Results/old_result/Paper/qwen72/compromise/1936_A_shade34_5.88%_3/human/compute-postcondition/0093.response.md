Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0, `mak2` is equal to `mak`.**
