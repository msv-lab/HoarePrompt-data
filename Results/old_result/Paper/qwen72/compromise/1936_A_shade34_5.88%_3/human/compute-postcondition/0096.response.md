Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0.
   - `pans` is an empty list.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - `mak` is the highest value of `i` for which the user input was a string equal to `<`. If no user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The string `'?'` is a constant and will be printed as is.
   - `mak` is 0 if no user input was `<`. If there was a user input `<` at some index `i`, `mak` would be that index, but since the problem does not specify any user input, we assume `mak` is 0.
   - `mak2` is equal to `mak`, so it is also 0.
   - `i` is 0 as given in the initial state.
   - The last `mak2` in the print statement is also 0.

4. **Construct the Output:**
   - The print statement will output the string `'?'` followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **? 0 0 0 0**
