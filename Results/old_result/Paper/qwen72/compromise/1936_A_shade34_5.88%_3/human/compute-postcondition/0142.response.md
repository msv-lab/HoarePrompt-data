Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `pans` must have at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', `mak` is 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or 1 based on the user input if the input is not '>', otherwise `mak` is 2.***
