Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is an empty list, the output buffer has been flushed, `mak` is 0, `mak2` is 0, `s` is `<`.**

Explanation:
- The code `mak = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 0) to `mak`.
- Since `mak` is now 0, and `mak2` is equal to `mak`, `mak2` is also 0.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `pans`, `s`, and the output buffer state) remain unchanged.
