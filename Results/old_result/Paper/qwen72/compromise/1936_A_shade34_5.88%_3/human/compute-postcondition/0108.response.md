To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial and adjusted states step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 0.
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `n` must remain greater than the new value of `i` for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted State:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

### Final State:
- The `print` statement is:
  ```python
  print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
  ```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement will output a string that starts with `?`.
- The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `i` are mentioned in the `print` statement.
- From the adjusted state, we know that `i` is now 1.
- The values of `mak` and `mak2` are not provided in the initial or adjusted states, so we cannot determine their exact values. However, we can describe them as they are defined in the context.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output a string that starts with `?`, followed by the values of `mak`, `mak2`, `i`, and `mak2` again. Since the exact values of `mak` and `mak2` are not provided, we can only describe them as they are defined in the context.

Output: **? [mak] [mak2] 1 [mak2] (where [mak] is the value of `mak`, [mak2] is the value of `mak2`, and `i` is 1)**
