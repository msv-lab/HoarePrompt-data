Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

1. **`i` is `len(pans) - 1`**: This means `i` is the index of the last element in the list `pans`.
2. **`pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations**: This indicates that `pans` is a list with a sufficient number of elements to support the loop's iterations.
3. **`n` is an input integer greater than 0**: This means `n` is a positive integer provided by the user.
4. **`mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`**: This means `mak2` is the largest index where the user input was the character `<`.
5. **`mak` is the highest index for which the user input was `>` during the loop's execution**: This means `mak` is the largest index where the user input was the character `>`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('!', mak2, mak)` will output the following:

- The string `'!'`.
- The value of `mak2`, which is the highest index where the user input was `<`.
- The value of `mak`, which is the highest index where the user input was `>`.

Since the exact values of `mak2` and `mak` are not provided, we can only describe them based on the given conditions.

Output: **! [mak2] [mak] (where [mak2] is the highest index for which the user input was `<` and [mak] is the highest index for which the user input was `>`)**
