The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`_` is the loop control variable, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is a string that equals `<`, `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
