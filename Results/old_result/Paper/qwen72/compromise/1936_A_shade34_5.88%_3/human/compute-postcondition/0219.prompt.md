Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function operates in an interactive environment with a hidden permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements from the permutation. The function must find and output a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, and 0 ≤ i, j < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '<':
            mak = i
    mak2 = mak
    pans = []
    for i in range(n):
        print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
        sys.stdout.flush()
        s = str(input())
        if s == '<':
            mak = i
            pans = [i]
        elif s == '=':
            pans.append(i)
    mak = 0
    for i in range(1, len(pans)):
        print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
        sys.stdout.flush()
        if str(input()) == '>':
            mak = i
    print('!', mak2, mak)
    sys.stdout.flush()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list that must have at least `len(pans)` elements, `mak` remains unchanged, and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and `mak` is the highest index for which the user input was `>` during the loop's execution. The output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is `len(pans) - 1`, `pans` is a list containing all indices `i` for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<` and must have at least 2 elements, `n` is greater than `len(pans)`, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, the output buffer has been flushed, and `mak` is the index of the last element in `pans` for which the user input was `>` or remains 0 if no such input was received.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
