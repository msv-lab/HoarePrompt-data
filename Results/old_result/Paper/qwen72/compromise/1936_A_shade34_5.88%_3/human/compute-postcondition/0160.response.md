The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `pans` has at least as many elements as the number of iterations, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is `<`, `mak` is set to 2. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.**
