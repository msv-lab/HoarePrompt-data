Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `pans` is a list containing the indices for which the user input was `=` or the highest index for which the user input was `<`. `mak` is 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(pans)):
    print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
    sys.stdout.flush()
    if str(input()) == '>':
        mak = i


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 1, `pans` must have at least 2 elements, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`. The `sys.stdout.flush()` function has been called, ensuring that any buffered output is written to the terminal or output stream immediately. If the user input is `'>`', `mak` is set to 1. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is 2, `pans` must have at least 3 elements, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, `mak` remains 0 or 1 based on the user input if the input is not '>', otherwise `mak` is 2, and the output buffer has been flushed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`i` is 3, `pans` must have at least 4 elements, `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `mak2` is equal to the highest index for which the user input was `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the user input is '>', `mak` is 3. Otherwise, `mak` remains 0 or 1 based on the user input if the input is not '>', otherwise `mak` is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
