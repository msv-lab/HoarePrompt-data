You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                template.append(a[i])
            else:
                template.append(a[i].upper())
        match_a_b = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    match_a_b = False
                    break
            elif a[i].lower() == template[i].lower() or b[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_a_b = False
                break
        match_c = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i].islower():
                if c[i] != template[i]:
                    match_c = False
                    break
            elif c[i].lower() == template[i].lower():
                match_c = False
                break
        if match_a_b and (not match_c):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three inputs: an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 20), and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` (each of length `n` and containing lowercase Latin letters). It then processes these inputs to determine if a specific condition is met: the strings `a` and `b` must match a generated template, and the string `c` must not match this template. The template is constructed by comparing characters of `a` and `b` and using uppercase characters where they differ. If the condition is met, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program is that the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last test case, and the template list will be the result of the last test case's calculations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction:**
   - The program constructs a template `template` by iterating through each character of the strings `a` and `b`.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, it appends the character to `template` as a lowercase letter.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, it appends the character from `a` to `template` as an uppercase letter.

3. **Matching Conditions:**
   - The program checks if strings `a` and `b` match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template character.
   - The program checks if string `c` does not match the template:
     - For each position `i`, if the template character is lowercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is not the same as the template character.
     - If the template character is uppercase, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is different from the lowercase version of the template character.

4. **Output:**
   - If both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template, the program prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Template Construction:**
  - The logic for constructing the template is correct. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template should have the same lowercase character. If they are different, the template should have an uppercase character to ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template.

- **Matching Conditions:**
  - The conditions for checking if `a` and `b` match the template are correct.
  - The conditions for checking if `c` does not match the template are also correct.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are identical and `c` is different.
  - It also handles the case where `a` and `b` have different characters at some positions, and `c` has the same character as one of them at those positions.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. The conditions and logic are sound and cover all the required cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
