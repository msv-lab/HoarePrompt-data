To determine the output state, let's break down the loop and understand what it does:

1. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
2. For each number `num` in this range, it checks if `num` is a key in the dictionary `count_a`.
3. If `num` is in `count_a` and its value (the count) is 2, it increments `max_score` by 1.

Given the initial state:
- `count_a` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value associated with each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`.
- `max_score` is 0.

After the loop finishes executing, `max_score` will be the number of unique integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice.

Output State: **`max_score` is the number of unique integers in the list `a` that appear exactly twice, and `count_a` remains unchanged.**
