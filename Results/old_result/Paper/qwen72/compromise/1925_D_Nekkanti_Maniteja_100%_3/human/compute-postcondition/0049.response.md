Output State: **`i` is `k`, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is `s + c * ((k-1) * k // 2) * c * m + c * a * k`, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, `u` is the last input integer, `v` is the second last input integer, `f` is the third last input integer, `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated to the new input values, where `n` and `m` are integers and `k` is an integer greater than the initial `k` and greater than the initial `k`.**
