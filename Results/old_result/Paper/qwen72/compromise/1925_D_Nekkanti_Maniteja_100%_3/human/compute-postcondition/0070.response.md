Output State: **`M` is 1000000007, `i` is `k-1`, `k` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `u` is the last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `v` is the second last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `f` is the third last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, `a` is the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, `s` is `c * a * k + c * m * c * (k * (k - 1) // 2)`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`M`**: Remains 1000000007, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `k-1`, because the loop runs `k` times and `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 each iteration.
- **`k`**: Remains an input integer greater than or equal to 3, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`m`**: Remains an input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: Remains an input integer, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`c`**: Remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`u`**: Remains the last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`v`**: Remains the second last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`f`**: Remains the third last input integer from the `m`-th iteration, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: Remains the sum of all `f` values from the `m` iterations, as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`s`**: After the loop completes, `s` will be the sum of the expressions `c * a + c * i * c * m` for each iteration from `i = 0` to `i = k-1`. This can be simplified to `c * a * k + c * m * c * (k * (k - 1) // 2)`. The term `c * a * k` comes from adding `c * a` `k` times, and the term `c * m * c * (k * (k - 1) // 2)` comes from the sum of `c * i * c * m` for `i` from 0 to `k-1`, which is a sum of an arithmetic series.
