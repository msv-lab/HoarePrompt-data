Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. For each test case, it reads `m` lines of input, each containing integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. The function calculates a value `s` based on the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, the sum of all `f_i` values, and the values of `k` and `m`. The final value of `s` is printed modulo `1000000007` for each test case. **
