Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` must be greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`, `a` is equal to the sum of all `f` values input during the `m` iterations, `u` is the last input integer, `v` is the second last input integer, `f` is the third last input integer.**

Explanation:
- The value of `s` is updated to `s + c * i * c * m + c * a`.
- `i` is 1, so `c * i * c * m` simplifies to `c * c * m`.
- The new value of `s` is `s + c * c * m + c * a`.
- All other variables (`i`, `k`, `m`, `n`, `M`, `c`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f`) remain unchanged.
