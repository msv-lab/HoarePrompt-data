Output State: **`i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than the initial `k`, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `1000000007`, `s` is 0, `a` is equal to `f`, `u` is the first input integer, `v` is the second input integer, `f` is the third input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `u, v, f = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `u`, `v`, and `f` respectively.
- The initial values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated to the new input values.
- All other variables (`i`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, `a`) remain unchanged.
- The new values of `u`, `v`, and `f` are now the first, second, and third input integers, respectively.
