The only object in the loop head is the variable `i`. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for `i`, but the input value must be ensured to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
