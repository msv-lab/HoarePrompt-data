Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `k` are unspecified integers, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is assigned the value of the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `M`. The values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `M` is still 1000000007. The modular multiplicative inverse of a number `a` modulo `M` is a number `b` such that `(a * b) % M = 1`. In this case, `a` is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
