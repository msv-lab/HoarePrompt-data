Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the problem described:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs. However, the way it accumulates the expected value is incorrect.
   - The line `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values should be calculated differently.

2. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - For each excursion, the expected value of the friendship value of the chosen pair can be calculated as the sum of the friendship values of all pairs of friends divided by the total number of possible pairs of children.
   - The expected value for the sum of friendship values over all k excursions is the sum of the expected values for each excursion.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers, but the way it accumulates the expected value is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends divided by the total number of possible pairs of children.
- For each excursion, the expected value of the friendship value of the chosen pair is the same, so the total expected value over k excursions is simply k times the expected value for one excursion.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        if total_pairs == 0:
            print(0)
            continue
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_value = (a * c) % M
        total_expected_value = (expected_value * k) % M
        print(total_expected_value)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`total_pairs`**: This is the total number of possible pairs of children.
- **`c`**: This is the modular inverse of the total number of pairs.
- **`a`**: This is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.
- **`expected_value`**: This is the expected value of the friendship value of a randomly chosen pair of friends.
- **`total_expected_value`**: This is the total expected value over k excursions, which is `k * expected_value`.

This corrected program should correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
