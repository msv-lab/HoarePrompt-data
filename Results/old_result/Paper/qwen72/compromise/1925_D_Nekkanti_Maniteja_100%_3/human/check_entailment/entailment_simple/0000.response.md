### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It initializes `M` to \(10^9 + 7\), which is the modulus for the final answer.

2. **Modular Multiplicative Inverse:**
   - The program calculates `c` as the modular multiplicative inverse of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is correct because \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs of children, and `c` is used to normalize the probability of selecting a pair.

3. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly sums the initial friendship values `f` for all pairs of friends and stores this sum in `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen.
   - The loop `for i in range(k):` is used to accumulate the expected value.
   - However, the formula used inside the loop is incorrect. The expected value for each excursion should be calculated as the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions.
   - The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \left( \frac{a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \right) \mod M
     \]
   - The program's current formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the result `s % M` for each test case.

### Correct Formula:
The correct formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen is:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = \left( \frac{a \cdot k + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}} \right) \mod M
\]
This can be simplified to:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = \left( a \cdot k \cdot c + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \cdot c \right) \mod M
\]

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        a = 0
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        # Correct expected value calculation
        expected_value = (a * k * c + m * k * (k + 1) // 2 * c) % M
        
        print(expected_value)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the incorrect formula used in the expected value calculation. The corrected program uses the correct formula and should produce the correct results.
