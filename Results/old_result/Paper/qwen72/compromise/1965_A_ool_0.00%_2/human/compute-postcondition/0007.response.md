The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `set_`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `set_`. For the loop to execute, `set_` must have at least 2 elements (since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `len(set_) - 1`). The variable `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of arr is between 1 and 2 * 10^5; A is False; the first element of arr is 1; set_ is a sorted list containing the unique elements from arr and must have at least 2 elements; not_c is True; `i` is 1**
