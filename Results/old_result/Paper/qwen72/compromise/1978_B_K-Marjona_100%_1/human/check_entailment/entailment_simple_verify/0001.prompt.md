You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the output is either `a * n` if `b <= a`, or `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` where `k = min(n, b - a)`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged as they are input for each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Determine the Optimal `k`:**
   - The variable `k` is set to `min(n, b - a)`. This is because Bob can choose to sell up to `n` buns at the modified price, but the modified price should not be less than the usual price `a`. Therefore, the maximum `k` should be `b - a` to ensure the modified price is always greater than or equal to `a`.

3. **Calculate the Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is not beneficial, and Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The profit in this case is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, Bob will sell the first `k` buns at the modified price. The profit from these `k` buns is calculated as `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`. This formula comes from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - k + 1`.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `(n - k) * a` to the profit.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - The function prints the total profit for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 4 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Modified price profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 = 5`
    - Usual price profit: `(4 - 1) * 4 = 12`
    - Total profit: `5 + 12 = 17`
  - Output: `17` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 5 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Modified price profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 = 36 - 6 = 30`
    - Usual price profit: `(5 - 4) * 5 = 5`
    - Total profit: `30 + 5 = 35`
  - Output: `35` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `10 10 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Usual price profit: `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Output: `100` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5 5 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Modified price profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 = 55 - 10 = 45`
  - Output: `45` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Usual price profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Usual price profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `1000 1 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is calculated as:
    - Modified price profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 = 999000 - 498501 = 499499`
    - Usual price profit: `(1000 - 999) * 1 = 1`
    - Total profit: `499499 + 1 = 500500`
  - Output: `500500` (Correct)
