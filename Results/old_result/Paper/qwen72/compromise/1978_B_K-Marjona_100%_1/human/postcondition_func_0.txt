The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`). For each test case, it computes and prints a result based on the following logic: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the result is `a * n`. Otherwise, the result is `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and their results printed, but the input values `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged.
