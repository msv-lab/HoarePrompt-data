The variables in the loop head are `power` and `log2(n)`. For the loop to execute, `power` must be less than `log2(n)`.

- `power` is currently 1.
- `log2(n)` depends on the value of `n`, which is an input integer and is not equal to 1.

For `power < log2(n)` to be true, `log2(n)` must be greater than 1. Since `log2(n)` is greater than 1 when `n` is greater than 2, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer and `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
