Output State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- `n_cases` remains greater than 0 because it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` remains 2 because it is not modified within the loop.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once. This condition is necessary for the loop to start and continue.
- `power` will be the smallest integer greater than `log2(n)`. This is because the loop increments `power` by 1 until `power` is no longer less than `log2(n)`. When the loop terminates, `power` will be the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to `log2(n)`, but since the loop condition is `power < log2(n)`, `power` will be exactly one more than the largest integer less than `log2(n)`.
