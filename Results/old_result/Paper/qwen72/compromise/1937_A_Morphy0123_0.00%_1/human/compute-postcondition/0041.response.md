Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n_cases` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 2.
- `n` is a new input integer.
- `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\).
  - If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged.
  - If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\).
  - If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged.
  - Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement is a simple print statement that prints the integer `1`.
- The values of `n_cases`, `i`, `n`, and `power` do not affect the output of this print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
The code snippet prints the integer `1`.
Output: **1**
