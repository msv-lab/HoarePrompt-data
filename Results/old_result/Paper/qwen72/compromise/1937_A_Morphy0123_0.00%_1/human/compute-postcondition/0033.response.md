Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n_cases` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\).
   - `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\).
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n_cases` is not directly relevant to the calculation in the `print` statement.
   - `i` is 1, but it is also not directly relevant to the calculation in the `print` statement.
   - `n` is a value that must satisfy the condition \(n \geq 2^{(power-1)}\).
   - `power` is defined as the smallest integer such that \(2^{power} \geq n\).
   - The current value of `power` is equal to `n`.

3. **Calculating the Output:**
   - According to the initial state, `power` is equal to `n`.
   - The `print` statement is `print(2 ** power)`.
   - Since `power` is equal to `n`, the `print` statement will print \(2^n\).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the value of \(2^n\), where `n` is the current value of `power`.

Output: **2^n (where n is the current value of power and power is equal to n)**
