Postcondition: ***`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the new input integer, and `power` is the smallest integer such that \(2^{\text{power}} \geq \text{new input integer}\). If `n` is 1, `power` remains unchanged. If `n` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to \(2^{(power-1)}\). If `power` is equal to `n`, `power` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `power` is decremented by 1.***
