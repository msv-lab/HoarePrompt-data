To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition: `while power < log2(n)`.

### Current State:
- `n_cases` is greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `i` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition)
- `n` is the new input integer
- `power` is 1

### Loop Condition:
- The loop will execute if `power` is less than `log2(n)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Relevant Variables:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `power` and `n`.

2. **Initial Values:**
   - `power` is 1.
   - `n` is the new input integer.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `1 < log2(n)`.

4. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - `log2(n)` is the base-2 logarithm of `n`.
   - For `1 < log2(n)` to be true, `n` must be greater than 2. This is because `log2(2) = 1`, and for any `n > 2`, `log2(n) > 1`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 2.

### Adjusted State:
- `n_cases` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `power` is 1 (unchanged)

State: **`n_cases` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `power` is 1**
