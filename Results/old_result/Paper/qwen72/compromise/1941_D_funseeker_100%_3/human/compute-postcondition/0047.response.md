Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the same as the set `temp`.
- The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, `c`) remain unchanged.
- The specific values and constraints of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` are still valid.
- The set `ans` now contains the same elements as `temp`, which are the unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0'.
