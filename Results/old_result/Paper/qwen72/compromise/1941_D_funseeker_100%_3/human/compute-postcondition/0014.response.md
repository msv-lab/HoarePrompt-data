The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds a new element to the set `temp`. The new element is calculated as `(q + r) % n`. The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged. The set `ans` also remains unchanged. The updated state of `temp` depends on the initial value of `temp` and the value of `q`.

- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` initially contains the values `(x + r) % n` and `(x - r) % n`.
- If `c` is neither '1' nor '?', `temp` initially contains the value `(x - r) % n`.

In both cases, the new value `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.

Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the value `x` and at least one more element, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing the values `(x + r) % n`, `(x - r) % n`, and `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?'; otherwise, `temp` is a set containing the values `(x - r) % n` and `(q + r) % n`.**
