Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or all unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`**

Explanation: The code snippet `r, c = func_1().split()` updates the values of `r` and `c` based on the string returned by `func_1()`. The new value of `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string, and `c` is the second part of the string. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.
