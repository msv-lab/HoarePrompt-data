Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 1, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing at least two unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', or at least two unique values of the form `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', `r` is the integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` if `c` is '1' or '?', otherwise `temp` contains the value `(q + r) % n` and an additional value `(q + r) % n` if `c` is '0', and `q` is the second element in `ans`.**

Explanation:
- The code `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- If `c` is '1' or '?', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n`. After the code execution, `temp` will still contain these values, but `(q + r) % n` will be added again if it is not already present.
- If `c` is '0', `temp` already contains `(q + r) % n`. After the code execution, `temp` will contain an additional value `(q + r) % n` if it is not already present.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`, and `q` remain unchanged.
