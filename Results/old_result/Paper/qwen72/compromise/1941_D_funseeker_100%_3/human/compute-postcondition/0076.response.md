Let's break down the initial state and the behavior of the code step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` remains unchanged with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 1000\).
- `m` remains unchanged with the constraint \(1 \leq m \leq 1000\).
- `x` remains unchanged with the constraint \(1 \leq x \leq n\).
- `ans` is a set that starts with a single value `x`.
- For each of the `m` iterations:
  - If `c` is '1' or '?', `ans` is updated to include all unique values of the form \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) for each `q` in the set `ans` from the previous iteration.
  - If `c` is '0', `ans` is updated to include all unique values of the form \((q + r) \% n\) for each `q` in the set `ans` from the previous iteration.
- If 0 is in `ans`, then 0 is removed from `ans` and `n` is included in `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `ans` starts as a set containing a single value `x`.
   - `x` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq x \leq n\).

2. **Iteration Process**:
   - For each iteration from 1 to `m`:
     - If `c` is '1' or '?':
       - For each `q` in `ans`, compute \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) for each `r` in `ans` and add the results to `ans`.
     - If `c` is '0':
       - For each `q` in `ans`, compute \((q + r) \% n\) for each `r` in `ans` and add the results to `ans`.

3. **Final Set Update**:
   - After all iterations, if 0 is in `ans`, remove 0 and add `n` to `ans`.

### Determining the Output:
- **Initial Set**:
  - `ans` starts with \(\{x\}\).

- **First Iteration**:
  - If `c` is '1' or '?':
    - `ans` will include \((x + x) \% n\) and \((x - x) \% n\).
    - \((x + x) \% n = 2x \% n\)
    - \((x - x) \% n = 0\)
    - So, `ans` becomes \(\{x, 2x \% n, 0\}\).
  - If `c` is '0':
    - `ans` will include \((x + x) \% n\).
    - \((x + x) \% n = 2x \% n\)
    - So, `ans` becomes \(\{x, 2x \% n\}\).

- **Subsequent Iterations**:
  - If `c` is '1' or '?':
    - The set `ans` will grow to include more values of the form \((q + r) \% n\) and \((q - r) \% n\) for each `q` and `r` in `ans`.
  - If `c` is '0':
    - The set `ans` will grow to include more values of the form \((q + r) \% n\) for each `q` and `r` in `ans`.

- **Final Set**:
  - After `m` iterations, if 0 is in `ans`, it will be removed and `n` will be added.
  - The set `ans` will contain unique values modulo `n`.

### Conclusion:
- The set `ans` will contain unique values modulo `n`, and after the final update, if 0 is in `ans`, it will be replaced by `n`.
- The number of unique values in `ans` will depend on the values of `n`, `m`, and `x`, as well as the value of `c` in each iteration.

Since the exact values of `n`, `m`, `x`, and `c` are not provided, we can't determine the exact size of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the length of the set `ans`.

Output: **len(ans) (where `ans` is the set of unique values modulo `n` after `m` iterations, and if 0 is in `ans`, it is replaced by `n`)**
