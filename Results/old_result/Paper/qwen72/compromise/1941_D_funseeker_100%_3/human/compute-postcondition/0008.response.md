Output State: **`n` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 2 <= n <= 1000, `m` is a value returned by `func_3()` and must be greater than 0, `x` is a value returned by `func_3()` with the constraint 1 <= x <= n, `ans` is a set containing the value `x`, `r` is an integer value of the first part of the string returned by `func_1().split()`, `c` is the second part of the string returned by `func_1().split()` and is either '0' or '?', `temp` is a set containing the value `(q + r) % n`, `q` is the first element in `ans` which is `x`.**

Explanation:
- `q` is the first element in `ans`, which is `x`.
- `temp.add((q + r) % n)` adds the value `(q + r) % n` to the set `temp`.
- Since `q` is `x`, the value added to `temp` is `(x + r) % n`.
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `x`, `ans`, `r`, `c`) remain unchanged.
