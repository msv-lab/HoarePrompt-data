Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are used to read input efficiently. `func_1` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace. `func_2` converts the result of `func_1` to an integer, and `func_3` splits the line into multiple integers.

2. **Main Function (`func_4`)**:
   - **Initialization**: The function reads the number of players `n`, the number of throws `m`, and the starting player `x`. It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.
   - **Processing Throws**: For each throw, it reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`. It then creates a temporary set `temp` to store the possible positions of the ball after the current throw.
     - If the direction is '0' or '?', it adds the position `(q + r) % n` to `temp`.
     - If the direction is '1' or '?', it adds the position `(q - r) % n` to `temp`.
   - **Update Possible Positions**: After processing all throws, it updates `ans` to the temporary set `temp`.
   - **Adjust for 1-based Indexing**: If `0` is in the set `ans`, it is removed and `n` is added to account for 1-based indexing.
   - **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of players who could have the ball and the sorted list of these players.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the direction is unknown ('?').
   - It also correctly handles the 1-based indexing by adjusting the set to exclude `0` and include `n` if necessary.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of sets and the `%` operator ensures that the program efficiently handles the transitions and avoids duplicate positions.
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases efficiently, as required by the problem constraints.

Given the problem description and the constraints, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for valid inputs.
