The function `func_4` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin), strips any leading and trailing whitespace, splits the line into individual components, converts each component to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has a list of integers that were provided in the input line.
