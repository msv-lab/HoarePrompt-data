Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where it needs to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_6` function, specifically in the way it processes the edges and tries to find a cycle.

1. **Cycle Detection and Union-Find Misuse**:
   - The program uses a union-find (DSU) data structure to detect cycles, but it incorrectly processes the edges in the `func_6` function. The program sorts the edges in descending order of their weights and then tries to union the vertices. However, it should be sorting the edges in ascending order to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v:` should be used to detect a cycle, but the program incorrectly unions the vertices in this condition, which is not the correct way to handle cycle detection in a union-find structure.

2. **DFS Cycle Detection**:
   - The DFS function `dfs` is used to find the cycle, but it does not correctly handle the cycle detection. The function `dfs` should return the cycle path when it detects a cycle, but the current implementation does not ensure that the cycle is simple (i.e., it doesn't pass through the same vertex twice).

3. **Incorrect Cycle Path**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the cycle path should be returned. The `dfs` function should return the cycle path when it detects a cycle, but the current implementation does not ensure that the path is valid and simple.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
4 5
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
4 1 4
1 3 5
```

The correct output should be:
```
1 4
1 2 3 4
```

However, the program as written will not produce the correct output because it incorrectly processes the edges and does not correctly handle the cycle detection.
