### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Graph Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and stores the edges in a list `edges` with their weights, vertices, and sorts the edges in descending order of weight. This is appropriate for the problem since we are looking for the lightest edge in a cycle.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - The `DSU` class is used to manage the connected components of the graph.
   - The `DSU` class is initialized with `n + 1` elements (to handle 1-based indexing). This is correct and necessary for the problem.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges (from heaviest to lightest).
   - For each edge, it checks if the two vertices are already in the same component using the `find` method.
   - If they are, it means a cycle exists, and the program updates the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the vertices `node_u` and `node_v` that form this cycle.
   - If they are not in the same component, it unites them using the `union` method.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the condition `if parent_u == parent_v` should be `if parent_u != parent_v` to ensure the union operation is only performed when the vertices are not already connected. However, the current implementation already has this logic correctly.

4. **DFS for Cycle Traversal:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycle starting from `node_u`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited).
   - The DFS function `dfs` appends the current node to the path and recursively visits its neighbors.
   - If a node is revisited (i.e., its color is 1), it returns the path, indicating a cycle.
   - The current implementation of `dfs` is designed to detect cycles, but it may not always return the correct cycle path. Specifically, the condition `if res and node_v in set_res` ensures that the cycle includes the node `node_v`, which is part of the detected cycle. However, the path returned by `dfs` should be from `node_u` to `node_v` and back to `node_u`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the length of the cycle.
   - It then prints the vertices of the cycle in the order they were traversed.

### Issues:

1. **Cycle Detection Logic:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the union operation should only be performed when the vertices are not in the same component. However, the current implementation already has this logic correctly:
     ```python
     if parent_u == parent_v:
         if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
             _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
             node_u = u
             node_v = v
     else:
         dsu.union(u, v, w)
     ```
   - This logic is correct because it ensures that the union operation is only performed when the vertices are not already connected, and it updates the minimum edge weight when a cycle is detected.

2. **DFS Cycle Traversal:**
   - The DFS function `dfs` is designed to detect cycles, but it may not always return the correct cycle path. The current implementation:
     ```python
     def dfs(curr, parent, path):
         if colors[curr] == 1:
             return path
         colors[curr] = 1
         path.append(curr)
         for nei in graph[curr]:
             if colors[nei] != 2 and nei != parent:
                 res = dfs(nei, curr, path)
                 set_res = set(res)
                 if res and node_v in set_res:
                     return res
         colors[curr] = 2
         return []
     ```
   - This implementation correctly detects cycles by checking if a node is revisited. However, it may not always return the correct path. Specifically, the path should be from `node_u` to `node_v` and back to `node_u`. The current implementation may return a path that includes `node_v` but does not necessarily start from `node_u`.

3. **DSU Class:**
   - The `DSU` class is not defined in the provided code. This is a critical issue because the program assumes the existence of `find` and `union` methods, which are necessary for the disjoint set operations.
   - Without the `DSU` class, the program will not function correctly.

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified, the program is not correct as it stands. The DFS traversal needs to be fixed to ensure it returns the correct cycle path, and the `DSU` class should be properly defined.

Final: **False**
