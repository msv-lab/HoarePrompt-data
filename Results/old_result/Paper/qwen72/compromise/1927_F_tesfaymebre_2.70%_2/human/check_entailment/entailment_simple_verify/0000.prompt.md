You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where it needs to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_6` function, specifically in the way it processes the edges and tries to find a cycle.

1. **Cycle Detection and Union-Find Misuse**:
   - The program uses a union-find (DSU) data structure to detect cycles, but it incorrectly processes the edges in the `func_6` function. The program sorts the edges in descending order of their weights and then tries to union the vertices. However, it should be sorting the edges in ascending order to find the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v:` should be used to detect a cycle, but the program incorrectly unions the vertices in this condition, which is not the correct way to handle cycle detection in a union-find structure.

2. **DFS Cycle Detection**:
   - The DFS function `dfs` is used to find the cycle, but it does not correctly handle the cycle detection. The function `dfs` should return the cycle path when it detects a cycle, but the current implementation does not ensure that the cycle is simple (i.e., it doesn't pass through the same vertex twice).

3. **Incorrect Cycle Path**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the cycle path should be returned. The `dfs` function should return the cycle path when it detects a cycle, but the current implementation does not ensure that the path is valid and simple.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
1
4 5
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
4 1 4
1 3 5
```

The correct output should be:
```
1 4
1 2 3 4
```

However, the program as written will not produce the correct output because it incorrectly processes the edges and does not correctly handle the cycle detection.
