Correctness: **False**

The program provided has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **DSU (Disjoint Set Union) Implementation Missing**: The `DSU` class or structure is not defined in the provided code. The `find` and `union` methods are used, but their implementation is missing, which is crucial for the logic to work.

2. **Incorrect Use of DSU for Cycle Detection**: The logic for detecting cycles and updating the minimum edge weight is flawed. The `dsu.union(u, v, w)` call should only be made if `parent_u != parent_v` to avoid adding redundant edges to the same component. However, the current implementation incorrectly adds the edge to the union even when `parent_u == parent_v`, which is not the correct way to use DSU for cycle detection.

3. **Cycle Construction Logic**: The `dfs` function is intended to find the cycle, but it does not correctly handle the cycle construction. Specifically, the condition `if colors[curr] == 1` is used to detect a cycle, but the function does not properly backtrack to find the cycle path. Additionally, the use of `node_v in set_res` is not a reliable way to ensure the cycle includes the specific edge that was found to be part of a cycle.

4. **Global Variables and State Management**: The `graph`, `edges`, `colors`, `node_u`, `node_v`, and `_min_edge` variables are used globally, which can lead to issues when handling multiple test cases. Each test case should have its own isolated state to avoid interference.

5. **Edge Sorting**: The edges are sorted in reverse order, which is incorrect for finding the cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge. The edges should be sorted in ascending order of their weights to ensure that the smallest edge is considered first.

6. **Output Format**: The output format is not correctly handled. The program should output the cycle in the correct order, but the current `dfs` function does not ensure this.

To correct these issues, the program should:

- Define the `DSU` class with proper `find` and `union` methods.
- Correctly use the DSU to detect cycles and update the minimum edge weight.
- Properly construct the cycle using a more reliable method, such as tracking the path during the DFS.
- Ensure that each test case has its own isolated state.
- Sort the edges in ascending order of their weights.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
