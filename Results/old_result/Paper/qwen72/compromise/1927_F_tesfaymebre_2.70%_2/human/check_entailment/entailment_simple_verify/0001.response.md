### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Graph Construction:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` using `func_3()`.
   - It constructs the graph using a `defaultdict` of lists and stores the edges in a list `edges` with their weights, vertices, and sorts the edges in descending order of weight.

2. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU) Initialization:**
   - The `DSU` class is correctly initialized with `n + 1` elements to handle 1-based indexing.
   - The `find` method in the `DSU` class is implemented to perform path compression, which is efficient for union-find operations.
   - The `union` method in the `DSU` class is implemented to union two sets and update the minimum edge weight for the new set.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges (from heaviest to lightest).
   - For each edge, it checks if the two vertices are already in the same component using the `find` method.
   - If they are, it means a cycle exists, and the program updates the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the vertices `node_u` and `node_v` that form this cycle.
   - If they are not in the same component, it unites them using the `union` method.

4. **DFS for Cycle Traversal:**
   - The program uses a depth-first search (DFS) to find the cycle starting from `node_u`.
   - The `colors` array is used to track the state of each node (0: unvisited, 1: visiting, 2: visited).
   - The DFS function `dfs` appends the current node to the path and recursively visits its neighbors.
   - If a node is revisited (i.e., its color is 1), it returns the path, indicating a cycle.
   - The cycle is then printed with the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.

### Issues:

1. **Cycle Detection Logic:**
   - The original assessment identified an issue with the cycle detection logic, stating that the `union` method should only be called when the two vertices are not in the same component. However, the code already does this correctly. The `union` method is called only when `parent_u != parent_v`.
   - The condition `if parent_u == parent_v` is used to detect a cycle, and the program correctly updates the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the vertices `node_u` and `node_v` that form this cycle.

2. **DFS Cycle Traversal:**
   - The original assessment also mentioned that the DFS function `dfs` may not return the correct cycle path. However, the DFS function is designed to return the path when it detects a back edge to a node that is already in the path.
   - The function correctly marks nodes as visiting (color 1) and visited (color 2) to avoid revisiting nodes and to detect cycles.

3. **DSU Class:**
   - The `DSU` class is correctly defined in the provided code. It includes the necessary methods `find` and `union` to manage the connected components and the minimum edge weights.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment identified some issues that are not present in the code. The cycle detection logic and DFS traversal are implemented correctly, and the `DSU` class is properly defined. Therefore, the program should be able to find and print the correct simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
