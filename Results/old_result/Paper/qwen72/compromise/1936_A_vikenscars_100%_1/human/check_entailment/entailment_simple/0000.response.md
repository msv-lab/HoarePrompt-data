Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can make queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The goal is to achieve this with at most \(3n\) queries.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sends a query to the interactor and receives a response.
   - The query is in the form `"? a b c d"`, and the response is one of `"<"`, `"="`, or `">"`.
   - The function correctly formats the query and flushes the output to ensure the interactor receives it.
   - It then reads the response and returns it.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function is responsible for finding the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - **First Loop**:
     - The loop iterates over all indices from 1 to \(n-1\) to find the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
     - For each index \(i\), it compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{max_item_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
     - If \(p_i \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
     - This ensures that `max_item_idx` holds the index of the maximum element in the permutation.
   - **Second Loop**:
     - The loop iterates over all indices from 0 to \(n-1\) to find a pair of indices that maximizes \(p_i \oplus p_j\).
     - For each index \(i\), it compares \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\).
     - If \(p_{\text{max_item_idx}} \mid p_i\) is greater, it updates `pair_idx` to \(i\).
     - If they are equal, it further compares \(p_{\text{pair_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair_idx}}\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\) to ensure the correct pair is chosen.
     - This ensures that `pair_idx` holds the index of the element that, when XORed with `max_item_idx`, gives the maximum result.

4. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop makes \(n-1\) queries.
   - The second loop makes \(n\) queries.
   - The total number of queries is \(2n-1\), which is within the limit of \(3n\).

5. **Output**:
   - After determining the indices, the function prints the result in the required format `! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the smallest valid input \(n = 2\) correctly.
   - It also handles larger inputs within the given constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem within the constraints and follows the interaction rules.

Correctness: **True**
