The function `func_1` accepts four integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, all of which are within the range 0 to `n-1` (inclusive), where `n` is the length of a permutation `p`. It prints a formatted query string `? a b c d` to the standard output and then reads a line of input from the standard input. The function returns this input as a string. After the function concludes, the input parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged, and the program state includes the returned string from the input.
