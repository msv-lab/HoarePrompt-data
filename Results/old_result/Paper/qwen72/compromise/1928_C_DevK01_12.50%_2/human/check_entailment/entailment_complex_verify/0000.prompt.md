You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q and x are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9.
def func_1(q, x):

    #State: *`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `M` is a list. If `w` is an integer and `w` >= `x - 1`, `M` contains the integer `w`, which is the square root of `q`. Otherwise, `M` remains an empty list.

    return M
    #The program returns the list `M` which contains integers that are divisors of `q` and are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integers `q` and `x` (where 1 <= x < q <= 10^9) and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If the square root of `q` is an integer and is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it is also included in the list `M`. The function does not modify the input variables `q` and `x`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for some potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The program calculates `y = n + x`. However, based on the problem description, the correct approach should involve checking the position and the number received to determine the possible values of `k`. The calculation `y = n + x` does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a number, but it is not clear how this function is supposed to help in determining the valid values of `k`. The logic inside `func_1` is also flawed. For example, the condition `if w == w // 1` is not a valid way to check if `w` is an integer. Instead, `if w == int(w)` should be used.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` and `x` are such that `n < 3 * x - 2`, the program should not add the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`, but it does so without proper checks.

4. **Incorrect Output for Some Cases**: The program may output incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`. The correct output should be `4` (as mentioned in the problem description), but the program's logic might not produce this result correctly.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `n = 10` and `x = 2`:
- The program calculates `y = 10 + 2 = 12`.
- It then checks if `12 % 2 != 0`, which is `False`.
- It proceeds to call `func_1((12 - 2) // 2, 2)`, which is `func_1(5, 2)`.
- The function `func_1` will return an empty list because `5` has no divisors greater than or equal to `1` (which is `x - 1`).
- The program then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`, which is `10 >= 4`, which is `True`.
- It calls `func_1((10 - 2) // 2, 2)`, which is `func_1(4, 2)`.
- The function `func_1` will return `[2]` because `4` has `2` as a divisor.
- The program then converts this list to a set and prints the length, which is `1`.

However, the correct output for `n = 10` and `x = 2` should be `4`, as the valid values of `k` are `2, 3, 5, 6`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
