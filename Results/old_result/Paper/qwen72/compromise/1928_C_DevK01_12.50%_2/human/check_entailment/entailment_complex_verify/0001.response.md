### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem describes a pattern where numbers are assigned to positions in a line. The pattern repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - For a given position \(n\) and number \(x\), we need to determine how many different values of \(k\) (where \(k > 1\)) can fit the constraints.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
   - Each test case consists of two integers \(n\) and \(x\).

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The pattern of numbers repeats every \(2k - 2\) positions.
   - If \(n\) is the position and \(x\) is the number received, then \(n\) and \(x\) must satisfy the pattern.
   - The pattern can be broken down into two segments: the first \(k\) positions and the next \(k-2\) positions.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - For a given \(n\) and \(x\), the position \(n\) can be expressed as \(n = m \cdot (2k - 2) + r\), where \(m\) is the number of complete cycles and \(r\) is the remainder.
   - The remainder \(r\) must be within the valid range for the pattern to fit.

5. **Program Logic:**
   - The program calculates \(y = n + x\).
   - It checks if \(y\) is odd. If \(y\) is odd, it prints 0 because \(y\) must be even for the pattern to fit.
   - If \(y\) is even, it calculates \(q = (y - 2) // 2\) and calls `func_1(q, x)` to find possible values of \(k\).
   - It also checks if \(n \geq 3x - 2\) and if so, calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find additional possible values of \(k\).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

6. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of \(q\) that are greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).
   - It first checks if the square root of \(q\) is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\). This check is not necessary because the square root of \(q\) is not a divisor of \(q\) unless \(q\) is a perfect square.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the integer part of the square root of \(q\) and checks if they are divisors of \(q\).
   - If a divisor is found, it adds it to the list \(M\).
   - It also adds the quotient \(q // i\) to the list if it is greater than or equal to \(x - 1\).

7. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(y\) is odd by printing 0.
   - The logic for finding divisors in `func_1` is correct, but the square root check is unnecessary and can be simplified.
   - The program correctly combines the results from the two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
   - The program correctly prints the number of unique values of \(k\).

### Final Evaluation:
The program is logically correct and should work for the given problem constraints. However, the square root check in `func_1` is not necessary and can be simplified. Despite this, the program's core logic and functionality are accurate.

Final: **True**
