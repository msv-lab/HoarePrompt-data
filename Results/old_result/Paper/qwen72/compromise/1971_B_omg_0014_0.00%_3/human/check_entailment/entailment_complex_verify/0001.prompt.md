You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, where `1 <= n <= 1000`. It then reads `n` strings, each of which is a string of lowercase English letters with a maximum length of 10. For each string, it checks if the string contains exactly two distinct characters. If it does, the function prints 'NO'. If the string contains more than two distinct characters, it prints 'YES' and then prints the string in sorted order. If the string is already sorted in non-decreasing order, it prints the string in reverse sorted order; otherwise, it prints the string in sorted order. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s`.

2. **Set Creation:**
   - The program creates a set `a` from the string `s` to determine the number of unique characters in `s`.

3. **Check for Unique Characters:**
   - If the length of the set `a` is 2, the program prints "NO". This is because if there are only two unique characters, any rearrangement of the string will either be the same as the original string or a string that is a palindrome (if the string is of even length and both characters appear the same number of times), which is not allowed.
   - If the length of the set `a` is greater than 2, the program proceeds to generate a rearranged string.

4. **String Rearrangement:**
   - The program sorts the string `s` to create a new string `b`.
   - It also sorts the string `s` in reverse order to create a new string `c`.
   - If the sorted string `b` is equal to the original string `s`, it prints the reverse sorted string `c` to ensure the rearranged string is different from the original.
   - Otherwise, it prints the sorted string `b`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness for Test Cases:**
  - For strings with more than two unique characters, the program will always find a valid rearrangement because sorting or reverse sorting will produce a different string.
  - For strings with exactly two unique characters, the program correctly identifies that no valid rearrangement exists and prints "NO".
  - For strings with only one unique character, the program will also print "NO" because the set `a` will have a length of 1, which is not explicitly handled but will fall into the "NO" case due to the `if len(a) == 2` condition.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the string has only one unique character (e.g., "d") by printing "NO".
  - The program handles the edge case where the string has exactly two unique characters (e.g., "co") by printing "NO".
  - The program handles the case where the string has more than two unique characters (e.g., "codeforces") by generating a valid rearrangement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement. It ensures that the rearranged string is different from the original string when possible and prints "NO" when it is not possible.

### Correctness:
**True**
