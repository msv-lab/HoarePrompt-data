Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the string `s` has more than two distinct characters but rearranging them to form a string `r` that is not equal to `s` is still possible. For example, for the input `s = "abc"`, the program will output `YES` and then `abc` (which is the same as the input), which does not meet the requirement that `r` should not be equal to `s`. The program should instead output a different rearrangement, such as `bca` or `cba`.
