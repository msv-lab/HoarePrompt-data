Output State: **t remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters, n is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is not modified within the loop, so its value remains unchanged.
- The variable `s` is updated in each iteration of the loop with a new input string, but it always remains a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.
- The variable `n` is used to control the number of iterations of the loop and is not modified within the loop, so its value remains unchanged.

The loop itself performs operations on `s` and prints certain outputs based on the conditions, but these operations do not affect the values of `t` or `n`. The state of `s` at the end of the loop will be the last input string provided.
