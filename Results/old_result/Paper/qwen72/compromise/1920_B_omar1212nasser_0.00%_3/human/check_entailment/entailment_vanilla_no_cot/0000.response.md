Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the game's rules and constraints. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling of Removals and Negatives**: The program attempts to handle the removals and the negatives by sorting the array and then trying to minimize the impact of the negatives. However, the logic for handling the removals and negatives is flawed. Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum, and Bob should negate the smallest remaining elements to minimize the sum. The current logic does not correctly implement this strategy.

2. **Special Case Handling**: The program includes a special case for `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`, which returns 0. This is not a general solution and does not apply to all test cases.

3. **IndexError Handling**: The program uses a try-except block to handle `IndexError` when accessing elements in the list. This is not a robust way to handle the logic and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**: The program calculates the sum of the array and then tries to adjust it by removing and negating elements. However, the logic for adjusting the sum is not correct and does not follow the optimal strategy for both players.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        result = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(result)

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # Alice removes the smallest k elements to maximize the sum
    elements = elements[removals:]
    
    # Count the number of negative elements in the remaining array
    neg_count = sum(1 for e in elements if e < 0)
    
    # If there are more negative elements than Bob can negate, negate the smallest x elements
    if neg_count > negatives:
        elements.sort()
        for i in range(negatives):
            elements[i] = -elements[i]
    else:
        # If there are fewer negative elements than Bob can negate, negate all negative elements
        for i in range(neg_count):
            elements[i] = -elements[i]
        # If Bob has more negations left, he will negate the smallest positive elements
        if (negatives - neg_count) % 2 == 1:
            elements.sort()
            elements[0] = -elements[0]
    
    # Return the sum of the final array
    return sum(elements)

# Example usage
# func_1()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice removes the smallest `k` elements to maximize the sum.
2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob negates the smallest `x` elements to minimize the sum. If there are fewer negative elements than `x`, he negates all negative elements and then, if he has more negations left, he negates the smallest positive element to minimize the sum further.
3. **Sum Calculation**: The final sum is calculated after both players have played their optimal moves.

This corrected version should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output for all test cases.
