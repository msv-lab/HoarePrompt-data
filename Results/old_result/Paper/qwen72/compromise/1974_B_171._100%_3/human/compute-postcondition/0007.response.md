The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`. `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function returns a string `decoded`, which is formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding value in `char_map`. `char_map` is a dictionary where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its reverse position in the list.
