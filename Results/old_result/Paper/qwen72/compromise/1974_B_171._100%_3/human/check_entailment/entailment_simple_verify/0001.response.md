### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through the list to parse the number of test cases `t`, the length of each encoded string `n`, and the encoded strings `b`.
   - This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and ensures that all input is read and processed correctly.

2. **Test Case Loop:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the encoded string `b`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` to decode the string and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - This loop correctly processes each test case and collects the results.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - The function `func_1` takes the encoded string `b` as input.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique characters in the string `b` using `sorted(set(encoded))`.
   - It then creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each character in the sorted list to its symmetric character.
   - Finally, it decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

4. **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is essential for creating the symmetric mapping.
   - The use of `set` ensures that only unique characters are considered, and `sorted` ensures they are in alphabetical order.

5. **Symmetric Mapping:**
   - The program creates a symmetric mapping by pairing the first character with the last, the second with the second last, and so on. This is done using a dictionary `char_map`.
   - The loop `for i in range(len_unique): char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]` correctly establishes this mapping.

6. **Decoding:**
   - The program decodes the string by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method.
   - The generator expression `char_map[ch] for ch in encoded` ensures that each character is replaced according to the symmetric mapping.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles single-character strings correctly. For example, if the encoded string is "w", the unique characters list will be ["w"], and the mapping will be `{"w": "w"}`, resulting in the correct output "w".
   - It also handles strings with repeated characters correctly. For example, if the encoded string is "ttf", the unique characters list will be ["f", "t"], and the mapping will be `{"f": "t", "t": "f"}`, resulting in the correct output "fft".
   - It handles the case where the encoded string has all unique characters. For example, if the encoded string is "algorithm", the unique characters list will be ["a", "g", "h", "i", "l", "m", "o", "r", "t"], and the mapping will be `{"a": "t", "g": "r", "h": "o", "i": "m", "l": "l", "m": "i", "o": "h", "r": "g", "t": "a"}`, resulting in the correct output "algorithm".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct decoded strings. The original assessment is accurate.
