Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the integer `t` (number of test cases) and for each test case, it parses the integer `n` (length of the encoded string) and the string `b` (the encoded string).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters**: It constructs a list `unique_chars` of all distinct characters in the encoded string `b`, sorted in alphabetical order.
   - **Character Mapping**: It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character in the list. For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
   - **Decoding**: It decodes the string `b` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding value in `char_map` and returns the decoded string.

3. **Output**: The program prints the decoded string for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them.
   - The mapping of characters to their symmetric positions is done correctly.
   - The decoding process is performed correctly by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding value from the `char_map`.

Given the problem description and the execution states, the program appears to follow the correct logic for decoding the string as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
