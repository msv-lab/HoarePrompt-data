Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a card game where two players, you and Nene, take turns placing cards on a table. The goal is to maximize your score, which is the number of times you place a card that matches a card already on the table. Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Input Parsing**: The program reads input from stdin, which is a common practice for competitive programming problems. It processes the input in a specific way:
   - The first line contains the number of test cases `t`.
   - Each test case has two lines: the first line contains `n`, and the second line contains the integers on your cards.

3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program iterates over every second line starting from the third line (i.e., the lines containing the integers on your cards).
   - It splits the line into tokens (which are the integers on your cards).
   - It calculates the number of points you can get by subtracting the number of unique integers from the total number of integers.

4. **Logic Explanation**:
   - `len(tokens)` gives the total number of cards in your hand.
   - `len({*tokens})` gives the number of unique integers in your hand.
   - The difference `len(tokens) - len({*tokens})` gives the number of integers that appear more than once in your hand. This is because each unique integer can only appear once on the table to score a point, and any additional occurrence of the same integer will score a point.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - The logic assumes that you will always place a card that matches a card already on the table if possible, and Nene will play optimally to minimize your points.
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can score by counting the duplicates in your hand, as each duplicate can potentially score a point.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the number of points you can score.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by identifying the number of duplicates in your hand, which is the maximum number of points you can score if Nene plays optimally.

Correctness: **True**
