This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for ii in range(tt):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = x + y - 2
        
        tmp = []
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0:
                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
        
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0:
            tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
        
        tmp.sort()
        
        for i in tmp:
            if y >= i - 1:
                ans += i
                y -= i - 1
            else:
                break
        
        ans += y
        
        print(min(ans, n - 2))
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all `tt` iterations. `ans` is the final computed value for each iteration, which is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` where `y >= i - 1`, and finally plus the remaining value of `y`. `y` is reduced by the sum of `(i - 1)` for all elements `i` in `tmp` that were processed in the loop, where `y` was greater than or equal to `(i - 1)`. `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` is the total number of iterations. `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `tmp` is a sorted list containing the integer results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number and not equal to 2. If `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` is not equal to 2 and is even, then `tmp` also includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `tt` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` integers `a` representing chosen vertices. It then computes and prints the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the vertices in `a` and up to `y` additional vertices. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `tt` test cases have been processed, and the final state includes the printed results for each test case. The variables `n`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged for each test case, and `y` is reset for each new test case.
