Output State: **`n` is an integer input, `x` is an integer input, `y` is an integer input, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` must be greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `x + y - 2`, `tmp` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list `tmp`, and the initial state of all other variables remains unchanged.
