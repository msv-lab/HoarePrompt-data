Output State: **`a` is now sorted in ascending order, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` where `y >= i - 1`, and finally plus the value of `y`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` must have at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
