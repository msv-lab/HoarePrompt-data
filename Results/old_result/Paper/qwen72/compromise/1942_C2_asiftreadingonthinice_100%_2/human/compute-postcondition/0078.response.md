Output State: **`ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2. `tmp` is a list containing the values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference greater than 2. `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged, `ii` is `tt - 1`, `tt` must be greater than `ii`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, and `i` is `len(a) - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The value of `ans` starts at `x + y - 2` and increases by 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in the list `a` that have a difference of 2.
- The list `tmp` will contain the values `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` that have an even difference greater than 2.
- The variables `y`, `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` do not change during the loop.
- The variable `ii` remains `tt - 1` and `tt` must be greater than `ii`.
- The loop index `i` will be `len(a) - 1` after the loop has completed all iterations.
