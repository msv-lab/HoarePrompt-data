Output State: **`ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus `i`, and `i` is the second element of `tmp`. `y` is now `y - (i - 1)`. `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt - 1`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `tmp` must have at least two elements.**

Explanation:
- The value of `y` is updated to `y - (i - 1)`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
