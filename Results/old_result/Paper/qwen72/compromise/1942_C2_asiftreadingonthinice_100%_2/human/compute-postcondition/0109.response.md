Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` that have a difference of 2, plus 1 if `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2`, plus the sum of all elements `i` in `tmp` where `y >= i - 1`, and finally plus the value of `y`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` must have at least one element.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `a`.
- The initial state of `ans` remains the same, as the code snippet does not affect it.
- The values of `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged.
- The relationship `ii` is `tt` and `tt` must be greater than `ii` remains valid.
- The value of `i` is still the last element of `tmp` that was processed, and `tmp` must have at least one element.
