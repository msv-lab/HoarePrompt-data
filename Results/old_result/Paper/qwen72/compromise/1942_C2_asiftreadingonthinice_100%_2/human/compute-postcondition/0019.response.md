Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is 2, `ans` is `x + y`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. If the difference between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is an even number but not 2, `tmp` is a list containing the value `(a[2] - a[1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` is an empty list.***
