Output State: **`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `tmp` is a list containing the results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`n`, `x`, `y`**: These values remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`chosen_vertices`**: This list also remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`tt`**: This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`ii`**: This value remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`a`**: The sorted list of integers provided by the user remains unchanged as it is only read within the loop.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` starts at `x + y - 2` and increases by 1 for each pair of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is exactly 2.
- **`tmp`**: The list `tmp` collects the results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2. If no such pairs exist, `tmp` remains an empty list.
