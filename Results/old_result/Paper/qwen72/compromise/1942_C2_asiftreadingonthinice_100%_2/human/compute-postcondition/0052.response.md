Output State: **The loop has finished executing, `ans` is increased by the value of `y`, and `y` remains unchanged. The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans += y` increases the value of `ans` by the value of `y`.
- The value of `y` is not changed by this code.
- The values of `n`, `x`, `a`, and `chosen_vertices` are not affected by this code.
- The loop has already finished executing, so no further changes to `ans` or `y` will occur from the loop.
- The final values of `ans` and `y` are now `ans` (previous value) + `y` and `y` (unchanged), respectively.
