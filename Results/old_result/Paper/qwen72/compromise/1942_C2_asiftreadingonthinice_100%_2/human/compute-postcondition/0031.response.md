Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `y` are integers, `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, `tt` is greater than 0, `ii` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is the initial value `x + y - 2` plus the number of times the difference between consecutive elements in `a` is exactly 2, `tmp` is a list containing the results of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2` for all pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the difference is an even number but not 2, and the difference between the first element of `a` and `n` plus the last element of `a` is not equal to 2. If the sum of the first element of `a`, `n`, and the negative of the last element of `a` is even, `tmp` now includes the value `(a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2` as its last element.***
