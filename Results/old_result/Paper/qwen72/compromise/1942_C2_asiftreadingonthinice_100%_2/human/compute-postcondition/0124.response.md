Postcondition: ***`a` is now sorted in ascending order and must have at least 3 elements. `ans` is `x + y - 1` if the difference between the second element and the first element of `a` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is `x + y - 2`. `y`, `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` remain unchanged. `ii` is `tt`, and `tt` must be greater than `ii`. `i` is 2. If the difference between `a[i]` and `a[i - 1]` is an even number and not equal to 2, `tmp` is a list containing the integer result of `(a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2`. Otherwise, `tmp` is a list with one additional element.***
