Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect. The logic in the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. Specifically, the program calculates the sum of the differences between each non-zero element in `nums` and the last element in `nums`, and checks if this sum is zero. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Balance**: The condition `if curr == 0` is not a valid way to determine if the containers can be balanced. The sum of the differences between each element and the last element being zero does not guarantee that all elements can be made equal. For example, in the case `[4, 5, 2, 1, 3]`, the sum of differences is not zero, but it is possible to balance the containers as shown in the problem description.

2. **Ignoring the Sum Constraint**: The problem states that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, which means that the average amount of water per container is an integer. The correct approach should involve calculating this average and checking if it is possible to transfer water between containers to make all elements equal to this average.

3. **Logical Error**: The program does not consider the correct condition for balancing the containers. The correct condition is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, and the water can be transferred from any container to any other container with a higher index.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Calculate the average amount of water per container.
2. Check if it is possible to transfer water from containers with more than the average to containers with less than the average, ensuring that the water can only be transferred from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total = sum(nums)
        avg = total // n  # Calculate the average amount of water per container
        max_water = 0
        min_water = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i > avg:
                max_water += i - avg
            else:
                min_water += avg - i
        if max_water == min_water:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

In this corrected version, we calculate the total amount of water and the average amount of water per container. We then count the total excess water (`max_water`) and the total deficit water (`min_water`). If the total excess water equals the total deficit water, it is possible to balance the containers, and we print 'YES'. Otherwise, we print 'NO'.

Correctness: **False**
