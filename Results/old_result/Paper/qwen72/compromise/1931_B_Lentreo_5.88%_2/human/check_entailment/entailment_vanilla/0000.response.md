### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by `n`, then the target amount of water in each container is `sum(a) / n`.
   - The operation allows us to move water from any container to any container to the right of it.
   - To achieve the target amount in each container, we need to ensure that we can always move water from containers with more than the target amount to containers with less than the target amount.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container `nums`.
   - It then calculates `last` as the amount of water in the last container.
   - It initializes `curr` to 0 and iterates through the list `nums`.
   - For each container `i`, it adds `i - last` to `curr` if `i` is not zero.
   - Finally, it checks if `curr` is zero. If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaws in the Program:**
   - The program calculates `last` as the amount of water in the last container and uses it to compute `curr`.
   - This approach is incorrect because the target amount of water in each container should be `sum(nums) / n`, not the amount in the last container.
   - The program does not correctly determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from left to right.

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - Calculate the target amount of water in each container as `target = sum(nums) / n`.
   - Check if it is possible to make all containers have `target` amount of water by ensuring that the total excess water (sum of amounts greater than `target`) can be moved to the total deficit water (sum of amounts less than `target`).

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because it uses an incorrect method to determine if the containers can be made to have the same amount of water. The target amount should be calculated as the average of the amounts in the containers, and the program should check if the total excess can be moved to the total deficit.
