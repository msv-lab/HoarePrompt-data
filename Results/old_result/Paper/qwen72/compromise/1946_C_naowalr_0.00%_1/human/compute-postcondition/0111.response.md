Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**

Explanation:
- The code `leftover = dfs(1, 1)` assigns the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call to the variable `leftover`.
- The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
- The specific value of `leftover` depends on the implementation of the `dfs` function, which is not provided here. Therefore, we only state that `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.
