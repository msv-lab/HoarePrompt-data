Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is `(L + R) // 2`, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, `R - L` is 1 or less. If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), then `L` is the final value of `x`. Otherwise, `R` is the final value of `x`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `R - L` is greater than 1. After the loop finishes, `R - L` will be 1 or less.
- During each iteration, `x` is calculated as the midpoint between `L` and `R`.
- The `dfs(1, 1)` function call determines the `leftover` value, which is used to decide whether to update `L` or `R`.
- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` equals `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to `x`), `L` is updated to `x`.
- Otherwise, `R` is updated to `x`.
- After the loop completes, either `L` or `R` will be the final value of `x`, depending on the conditions checked during the last iteration.
