Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` and `b` contains the corresponding connected nodes as specified by the input pairs, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is 1, `R` is 50000, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call, and `numCuts` is less than or equal to `k` and either `numCuts` is less than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is less than `x`).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `R = x` updates the value of `R` to be equal to the value of `x`.
- The value of `x` is 50000, so `R` is now 50000.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
