Output State: **`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` remains 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is now 1, `R` is now 100001, `numCuts` is now 0, `x` is 50001.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets `numCuts` to 0, which updates its value from the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
