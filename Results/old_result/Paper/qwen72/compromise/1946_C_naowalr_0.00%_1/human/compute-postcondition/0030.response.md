The code snippet updates the value of `x` to be the integer division of the sum of `L` and `R` by 2. To determine the new value of `x`, we need to consider the values of `L` and `R` based on the conditions provided:

- If `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50000), then `L` is 50000 and `R` is 100001.
- Otherwise, `L` is 1 and `R` is 50000.

Given these conditions, we can calculate the new value of `x`:

1. If `L` is 50000 and `R` is 100001:
   - `x = (50000 + 100001) // 2 = 75000`

2. If `L` is 1 and `R` is 50000:
   - `x = (1 + 50000) // 2 = 25000`

Therefore, the output state will depend on the values of `L` and `R`:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `x` is 75000 if `numCuts` is greater than `k` or (`numCuts` is equal to `k` and `leftover` is greater than or equal to 50000), otherwise `x` is 25000, `leftover` is the result of the `dfs(1, 1)` function call.**
