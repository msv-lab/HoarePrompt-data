Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 3 read from standard input, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists where `adj[a]` now contains `[b]` and `adj[b]` now contains `[a]`, `z` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are specific integers read from the input, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0, `a` and `b` are updated to the specific integers read from the input, and `adj[a]` now contains `[b]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `adj[a].append(b)` adds the integer `b` to the list `adj[a]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.
- The initial state is preserved except for the modification to `adj[a]`.
