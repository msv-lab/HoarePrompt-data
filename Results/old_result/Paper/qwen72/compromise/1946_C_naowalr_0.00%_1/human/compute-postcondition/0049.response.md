Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `z` is 1, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `L` is the largest integer such that the condition `numCuts <= k` or (`numCuts == k` and `leftover < L`) holds, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code reads two integers `a` and `b` from the standard input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `b`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `adj`, `z`, `i`, `L`, `R`, `numCuts`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
