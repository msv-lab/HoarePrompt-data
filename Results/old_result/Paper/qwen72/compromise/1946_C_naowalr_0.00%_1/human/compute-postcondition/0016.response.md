Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `n - 1` times, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n - 2`.
- Each iteration reads two integers `a` and `b` from the standard input and appends `b` to `adj[a]` and `a` to `adj[b]`.
- After all iterations, `adj` will be a list of `n + 1` lists, where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `z` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
