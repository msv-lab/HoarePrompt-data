Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a tree represented by its adjacency list and two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of cuts that can be made in the tree such that no subtree has more than a certain number of nodes. The function prints the maximum number of nodes that can remain in any subtree after making at most `k` cuts, for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but it has printed the results for each test case. **
