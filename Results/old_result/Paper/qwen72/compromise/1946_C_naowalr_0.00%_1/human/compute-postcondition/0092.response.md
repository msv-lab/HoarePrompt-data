To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(n - 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variable `i` is the loop counter.
   - The expression `n - 1` determines the range of the loop.

2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0. This means `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **Adjust States:**
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial state of `i` should be 0, as it is the starting point of the loop.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `k` is the second integer read from the input.
- `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists.
- `z` is 2.
- `i` is 0 (initial state of the loop counter).
- `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input.
- `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`.
- `R` is `L + 1`.
- `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` must be greater than 1, `k` is the second integer read from the input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` empty lists, `z` is 2, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`**
