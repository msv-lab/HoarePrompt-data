The only variable in the loop head is `z`, so we can only adjust this one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `z` relative to `t`. If `z` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `z` is 1. Since `z` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `z` must be 2, and `t` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` remains a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` remains an integer greater than 1 read from standard input, `k` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5 read from standard input, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list at index `a` contains all the integers `b` that were paired with `a` during the loop, and each list at index `b` contains all the integers `a` that were paired with `b` during the loop, `z` is 2, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input, `L` is the largest value such that the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L` is less than or equal to `k`, `R` is `L + 1`, and `numCuts` is the number of cuts required to achieve a `leftover` value of at least `L`**.
