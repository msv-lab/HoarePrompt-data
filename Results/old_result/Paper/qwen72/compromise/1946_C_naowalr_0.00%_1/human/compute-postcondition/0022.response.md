Output State: **`t` is a positive integer read from standard input (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `adj` is a list of `n + 1` lists where each list `adj[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ n) contains the indices of nodes connected to node `i`, `z` is 0, `i` is `n - 2`, `a` and `b` are integers read from standard input, `L` is 1, `R` is 100001, `numCuts` is 0, `x` is 50000.**

The code snippet `numCuts = 0` initializes the variable `numCuts` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
