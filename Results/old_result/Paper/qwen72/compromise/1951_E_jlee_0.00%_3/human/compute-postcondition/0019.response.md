Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, `done` remains False, and all characters in `s` are equal to `x`. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
