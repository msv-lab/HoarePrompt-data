Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` > 1, `count` remains unchanged, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than 1, `count2` is 0, and `done` is False. The program continues to the next iteration of the loop or the next statement after the loop.***
