Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `x` is the first character of `s`, and `done` remains False. If all characters in `s` are equal to `x`, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `s` contains at least one character that is not `x` and `s.count(x) == n - 1`, the program also continues to the next iteration of the loop. If `n` is 1 or if `n` is greater than 1 and `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
