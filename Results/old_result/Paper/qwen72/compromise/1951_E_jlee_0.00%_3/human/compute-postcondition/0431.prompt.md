Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings `s` where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters and the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6. `t` is now an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    string = input()
    s = list(string)
    n = len(s)
    done = False
    if n == 1:
        print('NO')
        continue
    x = s[0]
    if x != s[-1]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        continue
    if s.count(x) == n:
        print('NO')
        continue
    elif s.count(x) == n - 1:
        if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
        continue
    count = 0
    count2 = 0
    for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
        if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            done = True
            break
        if s[j] != x and count < 1:
            count = j
        if count > 0:
            if s[j] != x:
                if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
                elif count2 == count:
                    if count > 1:
                        print('YES')
                        print(2)
                        print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                        done = True
                        break
                    else:
                        count2 = 0
                        continue
                elif count2 > count:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:])
                    done = True
                    break
            else:
                count2 += 1
    if not done:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`. If `done` is False, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` if such a character exists, otherwise it is 0. `count2` is the number of times a character in `s` that is not the first character and not equal to `x` was encountered, but only if `count` is a positive integer. If `done` is True, the program does not alter `count` or `count2` and retains the values as they were before the if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `count` is 0 or greater than 0. If `done` is True, the loop has encountered a condition where it printed 'YES' and the appropriate number (1 or 2) along with the `string` or a split of the `string` and then broke out of the loop. If `done` is False, the loop has completed all iterations without encountering such a condition, and `count` and `count2` will have values based on the number of times `s[j]` was not equal to `x` and the conditions checked within the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s`, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x` (or 0 if all characters are equal to `x`), `done` is False, and `count2` is the count of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first mismatch (or 0 if no such characters exist). If `done` is False, the program continues with these variable states.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
