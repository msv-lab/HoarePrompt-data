Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is a new input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
- `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1.
- `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- `count` is 0 or 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was less than 1, `count` is set to 1 and `done` is True if the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to the last character of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`).
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
- Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `string` is a new input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.

2. **Conditions and Variables:**
   - `x` is the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`).
   - `count` is 0 or 1.
   - If `s[1]` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1:
     - `count` is set to 1.
     - `done` is True if `s[0]` is not equal to `s[n-1]`.
   - If `s[1]` (i.e., `s[j]`) is not equal to `s[n-1-j]`:
     - `done` is True and we break out of the loop or if statement.
   - Otherwise, `done` remains unchanged.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(string[:j], string[j:])` statement will print the substring of `string` from the start to index `j-1` (inclusive) and the substring from index `j` to the end of the string.
   - Since `j` is 1, `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`, and `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string] [rest of string starting from the second character]**
