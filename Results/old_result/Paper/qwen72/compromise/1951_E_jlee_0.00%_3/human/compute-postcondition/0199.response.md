Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `string` is a new input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`.
   - `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1.
   - `x` is the first character of the new `s`.
   - `j` is 0.
   - `count` is greater than 1.
   - `count2` is 0 or greater than or equal to `count`.
   - `done` remains False.
   - The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`.
   - The current value of `count2` is equal to `count`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `j` is 0.
   - `string[:j - 1]` means slicing the string from the start to `j - 1`. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, slicing with a negative index means slicing from the end of the string. However, `string[: -1]` would give all characters except the last one. But `string[: -1]` when `j` is 0 is equivalent to `string[: -1]` which is an empty string because it starts from the beginning and ends before the first character.
   - `string[j - 1:]` means slicing the string from `j - 1` to the end. Since `j` is 0, `j - 1` is -1. In Python, `string[-1:]` gives the last character of the string. However, `string[-1:]` when `j` is 0 is equivalent to `string[-1:]` which is the last character of the string.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - `string[:j - 1]` will be an empty string.
   - `string[j - 1:]` will be the last character of the string `string`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **'' (an empty string), [last character of string] (where the last character is the last character of the input string `string`)**
