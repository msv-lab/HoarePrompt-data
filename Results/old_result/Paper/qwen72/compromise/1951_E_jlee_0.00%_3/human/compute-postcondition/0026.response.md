Let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.
2. `i` is 0.
3. `string` is an input string.
4. `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
5. `n` is the length of `s`.
6. `x` is the first character of `s`.
7. `done` remains False.
8. `n` is greater than 1.
9. `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`.
10. `s` contains at least one character that is not `x`.
11. The current value of `s.count(x)` is `n - 1`.
12. Either `n` is even, or `n` is odd and `s[(n - 1) // 2]` is equal to `x`.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the `print(1)` statement:

- The statement `print(1)` simply prints the integer 1.
- The value 1 is a constant and does not depend on any of the variables or conditions provided in the initial state.

Therefore, the output of the `print(1)` statement is straightforward:

Output: **1**
