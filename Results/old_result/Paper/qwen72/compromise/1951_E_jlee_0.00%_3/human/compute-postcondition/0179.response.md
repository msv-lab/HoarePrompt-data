The `print(string)` statement will print the value of the variable `string`, which is a new input string provided in the initial state. The exact content of `string` is not specified, but we know it is a valid string with at least one character, and its first character is not equal to its last character.

Output: **[string] (where [string] is the new input string provided, and it has at least one character with its first character not equal to its last character)**
