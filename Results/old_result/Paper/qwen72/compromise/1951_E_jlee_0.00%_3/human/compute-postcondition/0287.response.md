Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0 or greater than 0, and `done` is False. The loop has completed all iterations without encountering a condition where it printed 'YES' and the appropriate number (1 or 2) along with the `string` or a split of the `string`.**
