Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s`, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, `count` is 0, `done` is False, `count2` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for j in range((n + 1) // 2):
    if s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(string)
        done = True
        break
    if s[j] != x and count < 1:
        count = j
    if count > 0:
        if s[j] != x:
            if count2 > 0 and count2 < count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
            elif count2 == count:
                if count > 1:
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j - 1], string[j - 1:])
                    done = True
                    break
                else:
                    count2 = 0
                    continue
            elif count2 > count:
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:j], string[j:])
                done = True
                break
        else:
            count2 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is 0 or greater, and `done` is True if the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to the last character of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`). If `count` is greater than 0: If `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` remains unchanged. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is 1, the program skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. If `count2` is 0 or greater than or equal to `count`, the program continues executing the next statements after the if-else block. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is set to 1. If `count` is 0, the program continues executing the next statements after the if-else block.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 1, `count` is 0 or 1. If `count` > 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True if the first character of `s` (i.e., `s[0]`) is not equal to the last character of `s` (i.e., `s[n-1]`), and `count` is 0 or 1. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` remains unchanged. If `count` is 0, `count` and `done` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 0 or 1. If `count` is greater than 0, and `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is incremented to 2, and `done` is set to True if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1. If `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`, or if `count2` is equal to `count` and `count` is greater than 1, or if `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
