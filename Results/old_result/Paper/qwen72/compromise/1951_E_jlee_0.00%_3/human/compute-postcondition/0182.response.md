Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0. If the first character of `s` is not equal to the last character of `s`, `done` is True, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `done` remains False, `count` remains 0, and `count2` remains 0.***
