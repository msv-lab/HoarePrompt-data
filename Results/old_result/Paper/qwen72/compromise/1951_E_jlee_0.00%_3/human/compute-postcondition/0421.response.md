Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 2, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 3, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 0 or 1. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
