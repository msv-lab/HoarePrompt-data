Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 1, `string` is a new input string, `s` is a list of characters from the new `string`, `n` is the length of the new `s` and must be at least 1, `x` is the first character of the new `s`, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `count2` is 0, and `done` remains False. The current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` is greater than 0 and less than `count`.**
