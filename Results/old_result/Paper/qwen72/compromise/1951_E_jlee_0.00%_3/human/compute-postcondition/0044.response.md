Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to `j`, and `done` is True if the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` remains False. If `s[j]` is equal to `x` or `count` is not less than 1, `count` remains 0 and `done` is False if the character at index `j` in `s` is equal to the character at index `n - 1 - j` in `s`, otherwise `done` is True.***
