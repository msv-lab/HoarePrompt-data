Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` remain non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`). `elements` is a list of integers where each element is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 1000. `pos` is a list containing the values of `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of the loop. `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements. `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements plus the sum of the `negatives` elements that are `removals` positions before the end of the list.**
