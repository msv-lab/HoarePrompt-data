Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. It returns the maximum value from a list `pos` that contains the results of the expression `s - 2 * s2` after each iteration of a loop. Here, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements` minus the sum of the last `removals` elements, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements` adjusted by subtracting the sum of the last `removals` elements and adding the sum of the `negatives` elements that are `removals` positions before the end of the list. The function does not modify the input parameters `removals`, `negatives`, or `elements`. **
