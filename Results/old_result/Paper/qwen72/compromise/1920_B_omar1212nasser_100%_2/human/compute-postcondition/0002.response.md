Output State: **`removals` and `negatives` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `removals`, `negatives` <= len(`elements`), `elements` is a list of integers where each element is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 1000, `pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`.**

Explanation:
- The value `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` is appended to the list `pos`.
- `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`.
- `elements[-negatives:]` is a sublist of the last `negatives` elements of `elements`.
- `sum(elements[-negatives:])` calculates the sum of these last `negatives` elements.
- The expression `s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:])` computes the new value to be appended to `pos`.
- The values of `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements` remain unchanged.
- The value of `s` remains the sum of all elements in `elements`.
