The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of `lst` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list `lst` is equal to its sorted version `sorted_lst`. If `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99, and the list length between 2 and 50) and returns `True` if `lst` is sorted in ascending order, otherwise it returns `False`.**
