Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers (each between 0 and 99, and the list length between 2 and 50) and returns a boolean value indicating whether `lst` is sorted in ascending order. If `lst` is already sorted in ascending order, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`. **
