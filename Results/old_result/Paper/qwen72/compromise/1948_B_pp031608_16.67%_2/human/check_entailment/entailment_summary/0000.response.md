Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the list with its sorted version. If they are the same, the list is sorted, and the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This part of the code is correct and serves its purpose well.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `list1`.
   - It then iterates over the array to check if any element can be split to potentially make the array sorted.
   - The condition `if not func_1(list1):` ensures that the program only attempts to split elements if the array is not already sorted.
   - If an element at position `p-1` is greater than the element at position `p` and is greater than 10, the program splits the element at position `p-1` into its digits and inserts them back into the list.
   - After potentially modifying the list, the program checks again if the list is sorted using `func_1(list1)`.
   - If the list is sorted, it prints `Yes`; otherwise, it prints `No`.

3. **Splitting Logic**:
   - The splitting logic is implemented correctly. If an element is greater than 10, it is split into its tens and units digits and inserted back into the list.
   - However, the program only attempts to split the first element that violates the non-decreasing order. This is a critical flaw because it may not be sufficient to split just one element to make the entire array sorted. For example, consider the array `[12, 3, 45, 67]`. The first split will make it `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, but the array is still not sorted because `45` and `67` need to be split as well.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the array contains only single-digit numbers, as no splitting is needed.

5. **General Correctness**:
   - The program fails to handle cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array. For example, in the test case `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program will only split `12` and then check if the array is sorted, which it is not. It does not attempt to split `45` and `67` to make the array sorted.

Given these points, the program is **incorrect** because it does not handle all possible cases where multiple elements need to be split to achieve a sorted array.

Correctness: **False**
