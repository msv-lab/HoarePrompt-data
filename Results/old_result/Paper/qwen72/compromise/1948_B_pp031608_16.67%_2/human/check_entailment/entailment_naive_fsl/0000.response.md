Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to consider the possibility of applying the operation multiple times to achieve a sorted array. The program only applies the operation once and checks if the array is sorted, which is insufficient for the problem requirements.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will output:
```
Yes
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
Yes
```
This is because the array can be transformed into a sorted array by applying the operation to `12` and `45`:
1. Apply the operation to `12`: `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`
2. Apply the operation to `45`: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`

The final array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program does not handle this case correctly because it only applies the operation once and does not consider the possibility of applying it multiple times. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
