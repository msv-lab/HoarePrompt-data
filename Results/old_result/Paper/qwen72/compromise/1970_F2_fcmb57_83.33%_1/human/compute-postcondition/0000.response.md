Output State: **The code snippet `x, y = a` will result in an error because `a` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into two variables `x` and `y`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged: `a` and `b` are integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively, such that 0 <= a, b <= 10000.**
