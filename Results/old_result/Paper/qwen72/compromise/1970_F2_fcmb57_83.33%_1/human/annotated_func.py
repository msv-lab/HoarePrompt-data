#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the scores of the red and blue teams respectively, such that 0 <= a, b <= 10000.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program results in an error because `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`. Therefore, no values are returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both expected to be integers. However, the function attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` is an integer and cannot be unpacked, the function results in a `ValueError` and does not return any value.
