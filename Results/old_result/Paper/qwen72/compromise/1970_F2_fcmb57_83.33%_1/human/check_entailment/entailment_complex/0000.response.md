Reasoning:  
The program is incorrect due to a few issues:

1. **Function `func_1` Error**: The function `func_1` is designed to move an entity (player or ball) on the grid. However, the function expects `b` to be a tuple of movements (dx, dy), but the dictionary `mouvements` provides tuples of the form (dx, dy). The function should correctly unpack these tuples. The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it attempts to unpack an integer `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which results in a `ValueError`.

2. **Handling Ball Catching**: The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` is a comparison, not an assignment. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to correctly assign the player who catches the Quaffle.

3. **Handling Ball Throwing**: The logic for handling the Quaffle being thrown is incorrect. The program should check if the player is carrying the Quaffle before attempting to throw it. Additionally, the Quaffle should always return to the middle of the field after a goal is scored, regardless of the player's team.

4. **Bludger Elimination**: The program correctly checks for player elimination by a Bludger, but the logic for handling the Quaffle when a player is eliminated is incorrect. The Quaffle should remain at the player's position if the player is eliminated while carrying it.

5. **Final Score Output**: The final score is printed correctly, but the program should ensure that all other events are printed before the final score.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the rules of the game as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
