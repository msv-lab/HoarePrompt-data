The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input()` accepts an input and `int()` converts it to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `s` is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. These conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a binary string with 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and `n` is an input integer.**
