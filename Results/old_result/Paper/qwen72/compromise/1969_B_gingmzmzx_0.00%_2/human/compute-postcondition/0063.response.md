Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 1 element, `n` is 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `c` is the first element of `s`. If `c` is 0, `cnt` is [1, 0] and `ans` is 0. If `c` is 1, `cnt` is [0, 1] and `ans` is `zeroes - 1`.***
