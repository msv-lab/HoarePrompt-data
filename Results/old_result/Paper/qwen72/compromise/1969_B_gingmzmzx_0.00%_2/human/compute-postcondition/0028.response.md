The code snippet `s = list(map(int, input().strip()))` reads a line of input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts each character into an integer, storing the result in the list `s`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string
- `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1
- `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`
- `cnt` is [number of zeros in `s`, number of ones in `s`]
- `ans` is the sum of the number of ones before each zero in `s` plus the number of zeros after each one in `s`

After executing the code snippet, the list `s` is updated to contain the digits of the new input binary string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string, `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [number of zeros in `s`, number of ones in `s`], `ans` is the sum of the number of ones before each zero in `s` plus the number of zeros after each one in `s`.**
