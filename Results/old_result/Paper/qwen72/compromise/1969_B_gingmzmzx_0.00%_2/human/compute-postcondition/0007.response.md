The code snippet `cnt[c] += 1` increments the value of the element in the list `cnt` at the index specified by the variable `c`. Since `c` is the first element of the list `s`, and `s` contains integers representing the digits of a binary string, `c` can only be 0 or 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string that must have at least 1 element
- `n` is greater than 0
- `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`
- `cnt` is [0, 0]
- `ans` is 0
- `c` is the first element of the list `s`

After executing the code snippet:
- If `c` is 0, then `cnt[0]` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` [1, 0].
- If `c` is 1, then `cnt[1]` is incremented by 1, making `cnt` [0, 1].

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the input binary string that must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is [1, 0] if `c` is 0 or [0, 1] if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0, `c` is the first element of the list `s`.**
