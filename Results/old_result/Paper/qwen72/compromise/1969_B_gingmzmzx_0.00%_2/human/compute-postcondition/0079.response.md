Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5) and calculates a value `ans` based on the positions of '0's and '1's in the string. Specifically, for each '1' in the string, it adds the number of '0's that come after it in the string to `ans`. The function prints the calculated `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the state is such that `t` remains unchanged, `s` is the last processed binary string converted to a list of integers, `n` is 0, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the last `s`, `cnt` is the count of '0's and '1's in the last `s`, and `ans` is the final calculated value for the last test case. **
