Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `s` is a list of integers representing the digits of the new input binary string that must have at least 1 element, `n` is greater than 0 but will be decremented by 1, `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the list `s`, `cnt` is updated to [1, 0] if `c` is 0, or [0, 0] if `c` is 1, `ans` is 0 if `c` is 0, or `zeroes` if `c` is 1, and `c` is the first element of `s`.***
