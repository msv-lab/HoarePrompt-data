Correctness: **True**

The provided solution appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by reading a binary string, then calculates the minimum cost required to sort the string in non-descending order through cyclic shifts. The logic within the loop iterates through the string, maintaining counts of `0`s and `1`s encountered, and calculates the cost based on the positions of these characters. This approach aligns with the problem's requirements and constraints, and the output matches the expected results for the given examples. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
