### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings. Each cyclic shift on a substring `[l, r]` costs `r - l + 1`.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.
   - It counts the number of zeros in the string `s` and initializes a counter array `cnt` to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total cost.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of zeros in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any ones before the current position.
     - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the remaining number of zeros to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the total cost `ans`.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The algorithm correctly counts the number of zeros and ones in the string.
   - It calculates the cost by considering the number of ones before each zero and the number of zeros after each one.
   - This approach ensures that the string is sorted in non-descending order with the minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The algorithm handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - It also handles the case where the string has no zeros or no ones (e.g., "1111" or "0000").

5. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of test cases and `m` is the length of the string. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is an integer where \(1 \le t \le 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `s` is a binary string with \(2 \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

- **Inside the Loop:**
  - `s` is converted to a list of integers.
  - `zeroes` is the count of zeros in `s`.
  - `cnt` is initialized to `[0, 0]`.
  - `ans` is initialized to 0.
  - For each character `c` in `s`:
    - If `c` is 0, it increments the count of zeros in `cnt` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any ones before the current position.
    - If `c` is 1, it increments the count of ones in `cnt` and adds the remaining number of zeros to `ans`.

- **Final State:**
  - `t` remains unchanged.
  - `s` is the last processed binary string converted to a list of integers.
  - `n` is 0.
  - `zeroes` is the count of zeros in the last `s`.
  - `cnt` is the count of '0's and '1's in the last `s`.
  - `ans` is the final calculated value for the last test case.
