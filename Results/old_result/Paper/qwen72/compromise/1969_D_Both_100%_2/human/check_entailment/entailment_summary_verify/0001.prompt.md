You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves calculating the maximum profit Alice can achieve by selecting up to `k` items from a list of items. Each item has a price (from the `prices` list) and a bonus (from the `bonuses` list). The function reads the number of test cases and, for each test case, reads the values of `n` (the number of items) and `k` (the number of items to select), along with the `prices` and `bonuses` lists. It then calculates the maximum profit by considering the combined effect of prices and bonuses, ensuring that the selected items maximize the total profit. The function prints the maximum profit for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function completes its execution, and the state of the program reflects the final values of the variables used in the last test case, with `test_cases` being 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with `n` items, each having different prices for Alice (`a_i`) and Bob (`b_i`).
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, which is defined as the difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends.
   - Bob can take up to `k` items for free if Alice buys more than `k` items, and he will choose the `k` items that minimize Alice's profit.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a combination of sorting and a priority queue (heap) to solve the problem.
   - **Step-by-Step Breakdown:**
     - **Reading Input:**
       - `func_1` reads the number of test cases.
       - `func_2` reads the integers from the input and returns them as a map.
     - **Processing Each Test Case:**
       - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k`.
       - It reads the prices for Alice (`prices`) and the prices for Bob (`bonuses`).
       - It creates a list of tuples `combined` where each tuple contains the negative price for Alice and the price for Bob.
       - **Sorting and Initial Heap:**
         - The `combined` list is sorted based on the price for Bob (`b_i`).
         - The first `k` items are pushed into a heap, which will help in efficiently managing the items Bob can take for free.
       - **Calculating Initial Profit:**
         - The initial profit is calculated using `func_3`, which sums the profits from the items in the heap and the remaining items.
       - **Optimizing Profit:**
         - The program iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit by considering the effect of adding a new item and removing an item from the heap.
         - The maximum profit is updated if the current profit exceeds the previous maximum.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic for calculating the initial profit and optimizing it by considering the addition and removal of items is sound.
   - The use of a heap ensures that the items Bob takes for free are chosen optimally to minimize Alice's profit.
   - The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items.

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above.
