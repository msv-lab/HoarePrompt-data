Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle reading the input correctly. `func_1` reads the number of test cases, and `func_2` reads the subsequent lines of input, converting them into lists of integers. This part is essential for processing the input data as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Data Preparation**: In `func_4`, the input data is prepared by creating lists of negative prices (`neg_prices`) and bonuses (`bonuses`). These are then zipped together and sorted based on the bonuses. This step ensures that the items are considered in the order that maximizes the potential profit.

3. **Heap Management**: A heap is used to manage the selection of items. The heap is populated with the top `k` items based on their bonuses. This ensures that Bob will take the most valuable items for free, minimizing Alice's profit.

4. **Profit Calculation**: The function `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing the relevant values from the `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`. The logic in `func_4` updates the current profit and checks if it exceeds the maximum profit observed so far. This is done by iterating through the remaining items and adjusting the profit accordingly.

5. **Optimal Strategy**: The algorithm correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. Alice tries to maximize her profit by selecting items that maximize the difference between the bonuses and the prices, while Bob minimizes Alice's profit by taking the most valuable items for free.

6. **Edge Cases**: The code handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items available. It also correctly handles the case where the sum of the price and bonus is negative, ensuring that the profit is adjusted appropriately.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
