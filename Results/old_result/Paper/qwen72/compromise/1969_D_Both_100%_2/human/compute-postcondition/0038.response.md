The code snippet `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` subtracts the first element of the `removed_item` tuple from `current_profit`.

Given the initial state:
- `test_cases` must be greater than 0
- `_` is `k-1`
- `k` must be greater than 0
- `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including `item` and excluding the smallest element)
- `remaining_items` is an empty list
- `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`
- `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`
- `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`
- `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 1` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element
- If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged
- `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`
- `removed_item` is the tuple that was popped from the heap, and `removed_item` is not `None`

After executing the code snippet:
- `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including `item` and excluding the smallest element), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 1` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element, if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged, `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the tuple that was popped from the heap, and `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is `current_profit - removed_item[0]`.**
