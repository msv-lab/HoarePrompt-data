Output State: **`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now one element shorter than before, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last one, sorted according to the second element of each tuple, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `item[1]`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than the original `max_profit`, `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged. Additionally, the sum of the first and second elements of the current `item` is greater than or equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `current_profit` is decreased by the second element of the current `item`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
