Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`.** 

Explanation: The function `func_2()` is called and returns two values which are assigned to `n` and `k`. The other variables (`test_cases`, `_`, `heap`, and `remaining_items`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
