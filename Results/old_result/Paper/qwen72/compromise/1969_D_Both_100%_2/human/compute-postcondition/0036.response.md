The code `removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)` performs the following actions:

1. It pushes the `item` onto the heap.
2. It simultaneously pops the smallest element from the heap (based on the second element of the tuples, since the heap is maintained based on these values).
3. The popped element is stored in the variable `removed_item`.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact:

- `heap` contains the `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined`.
- `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`.
- `heap` is a min-heap, so the smallest element (based on the second element of the tuples) is at the top.

After executing the code:

- `heap` will contain `k` tuples, but the composition might change because `item` is pushed and the smallest element is popped.
- `removed_item` will hold the tuple that was popped from the heap.

The specific values of `heap` and `removed_item` depend on the actual values of `item` and the current state of `heap`. However, we can generalize the changes:

- `heap` still contains `k` tuples, but the smallest element (based on the second element of the tuples) might have been replaced by `item`.
- `removed_item` is the tuple that was popped from the heap.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including `item` and excluding the smallest element), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 1` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `item` is the last tuple that was removed from `combined`. `removed_item` is the tuple that was popped from the heap.**
