The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` performs the following actions:

1. It pops the last element from the list `combined`.
2. It pushes this popped element into the heap `heap`.

Given the initial state, let's analyze the impact of these actions:

- `combined` is a list of tuples, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order.
- Popping the last element from `combined` means removing the tuple with the highest second element (since the list is sorted in ascending order).
- This tuple is then pushed into the heap `heap`.

Since `heap` was initially an empty list, after pushing the popped element, `heap` now contains one element, which is the tuple with the highest second element from `combined`.

The updated state of the variables is as follows:

- `heap` now contains the tuple with the highest second element from `combined`.
- `combined` is now one element shorter, having lost the tuple with the highest second element.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains the tuple with the highest second element from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, and `combined` is one element shorter.**
