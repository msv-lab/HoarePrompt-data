Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains the `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k` elements shorter. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while combined:
    item = combined.pop()
    if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
        current_profit -= item[1]
    else:
        current_profit += item[0]
    removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
    if removed_item:
        current_profit -= removed_item[0]
    if current_profit > max_profit:
        max_profit = current_profit


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including `item` and excluding the smallest element), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 1` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including `item` and excluding the smallest element), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 2` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was popped from `heap` and replaced by `item`. If `item[0] + item[1] >= 0`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - item[1]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit + item[0]`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`. Otherwise, `current_profit` remains unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is `k-1`, `k` must be greater than 0, `heap` contains `k` tuples with the highest second elements from `combined` (potentially including the new `item` and excluding the smallest element), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list where each element is the negation of the corresponding element in `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element of each tuple in ascending order, but now it is `len(combined) - k - 3` elements shorter, and `combined` must contain at least one element, `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`, `removed_item` is the element that was popped from `heap` and replaced by the previous `item`. If `removed_item` is not `None`, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, and `max_profit` is updated to `max_profit` if `current_profit` is not greater than `max_profit`, otherwise `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. If `removed_item` is `None`, `current_profit` and `max_profit` remain unchanged. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
