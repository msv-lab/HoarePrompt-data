Postcondition: **`k` is 0, `_` is -1, `combined` is now two elements shorter than before, `heap` contains all the elements that were originally in `combined` except the last two, sorted according to the second element of each tuple. `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`. `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` adjusted as follows: if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is increased by `item[0]`. Additionally, if the sum of the first and second elements of `item` is greater than or equal to 0, `current_profit` is further decreased by `item[1]`; otherwise, `current_profit` is further increased by `item[0]`. If `removed_item` is not None, `current_profit` is further decreased by `removed_item[0]`. If `current_profit` is greater than the original `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to the value of `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged. `test_cases`, `n`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, and `bonuses` remain unchanged, and `removed_item` is the item that was removed from `heap` and replaced by `item` (if `removed_item` is not None).**
