The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99), and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).**
