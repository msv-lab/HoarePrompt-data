Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a rectangle of size \(a \times b\) can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reassembled to form a different rectangle. The key insight is that for a rectangle to be able to form a different rectangle after cutting, one of its dimensions must be even. This is because if both dimensions are odd, the only possible cuts will result in two rectangles that, when reassembled, will either form the original rectangle or a rotated version of it, which is considered the same.

The given program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints "Yes" because it is possible to form a different rectangle. If both are odd, it prints "No" because no different rectangle can be formed.

Let's verify this logic with the provided examples:

1. **Input: 1 1**
   - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
   - Output: "No" (Correct, as no different rectangle can be formed).

2. **Input: 2 1**
   - \(a\) is even, \(b\) is odd.
   - Output: "No" (Correct, as the only possible cut results in two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle).

3. **Input: 2 6**
   - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.
   - Output: "Yes" (Correct, as the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and reassembled into a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle).

4. **Input: 3 2**
   - \(a\) is odd, \(b\) is even.
   - Output: "Yes" (Correct, as the rectangle can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and reassembled into a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle).

5. **Input: 2 2**
   - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.
   - Output: "Yes" (Correct, as the rectangle can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles and reassembled into a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle).

6. **Input: 2 4**
   - Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.
   - Output: "Yes" (Correct, as the rectangle can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and reassembled into a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle).

7. **Input: 6 3**
   - \(a\) is even, \(b\) is odd.
   - Output: "No" (Correct, as the only possible cuts result in rectangles that, when reassembled, form the original rectangle or a rotated version).

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a different rectangle can be formed based on the evenness of the dimensions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
