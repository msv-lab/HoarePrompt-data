Reasoning:  
The program correctly identifies whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. The key insight is that if either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) is even, then Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearrange them to form a different rectangle. This is because an even dimension allows for a cut that results in two equal parts, which can be recombined in a different orientation to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, then any cut will result in rectangles that, when recombined, will only form the original rectangle or a 90Â° rotation of it, which is considered the same.

The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:`. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form another rectangle. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot form another rectangle.

The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description, and the logic is consistent with the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
