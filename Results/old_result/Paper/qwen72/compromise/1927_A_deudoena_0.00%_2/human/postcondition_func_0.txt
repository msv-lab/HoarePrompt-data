The function `func` reads a string `inpstr` from user input. It then finds the index of the first 'B' character (`ind1`) and the index of the last 'B' character (`ind2`) in the string. The function prints the difference between the length of the string and the sum of these two indices (`len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`). The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated result.
