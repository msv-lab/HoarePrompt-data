Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def min_segment_to_paint_white(t, test_cases):
```

With the precondition:

**t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**
