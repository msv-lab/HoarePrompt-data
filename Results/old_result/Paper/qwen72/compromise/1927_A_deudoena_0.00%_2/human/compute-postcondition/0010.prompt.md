You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples test_cases, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' character in `inpstr`, `ind2` is 0, `outind` is 0.
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
        
    #State: `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' character in `inpstr`, `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' character in `inpstr` when counting from the end, `outind` is 0.
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
    #This is printed: - Since the exact value of `inpstr` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the result of this calculation.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with at least one 'B' character. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. If the string `s` in a test case contains at least one 'B' character, the function returns a specific output based on the content of `s`. If the string `s` does not contain at least one 'B' character, the function returns an error or invalid input message.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
