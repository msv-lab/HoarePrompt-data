Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' character in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' character in `inpstr` when counting from the end.
   - `outind` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `len(inpstr)`: This is the length of the string `inpstr`.
   - `ind1`: This is the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - `ind2`: This is the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in `inpstr` when counting from the end. Note that this is the same as the index of the last 'B' in the string from the beginning.
   - `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`: This expression calculates the difference between the length of the string and the sum of the indices of the first and last 'B' characters.

4. **Explanation:**
   - The value of `ind1` is the position of the first 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - The value of `ind2` is the position of the last 'B' in `inpstr`.
   - The expression `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` will give the number of characters in `inpstr` that are not between the first and last 'B' characters, including the 'B' characters themselves.

5. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `inpstr` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`. However, based on the given information, the print statement will output the result of this calculation.

Output: **len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1 (where `len(inpstr)` is the length of the string `inpstr`, `ind1` is the index of the first 'B' character in `inpstr`, and `ind2` is the index of the last 'B' character in `inpstr`)**
