Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if Bob can form a different rectangle from the two resulting rectangles after cutting the original rectangle. Rectangles differing only by a 90Â° rotation are considered the same.

2. **Input and Output**: The program reads multiple test cases, each containing two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle. It should output "Yes" if Bob can form a different rectangle and "No" otherwise.

3. **Logic of the Program**:
   - The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integers `a` and `b`.
   - The function checks if `b` is divisible by 2 (i.e., `b % 2 == 0`).
   - If `b` is divisible by 2, it returns "yes"; otherwise, it returns "no".

4. **Analyzing the Logic**:
   - For a rectangle to be cut into two smaller rectangles and then form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions must be even. This is because only an even dimension can be split into two equal integer parts.
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, cutting the rectangle will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and no matter how you arrange them, the resulting rectangle will have the same dimensions (considering rotations).
   - If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle along the even dimension to form two smaller rectangles, and then rearrange them to form a different rectangle.

5. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program only checks if `b` is even. However, it should also check if `a` is even.
   - The correct logic should be to return "yes" if either `a` or `b` is even, and "no" otherwise.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate. The program is indeed incorrect because it only checks one dimension (`b`) for evenness, while it should check both `a` and `b`.

Final: **False**
