Reasoning:  
The provided program is incorrect because it only checks if `b` is an even number, which is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. The problem requires that Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then form a new rectangle that is different from the original one, considering that rectangles differing by a 90-degree rotation are the same.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:
1. If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.
2. If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle that is different from the original one because cutting an odd-length side will always result in two rectangles that can only be reassembled to form the original rectangle or a rotated version of it.

The correct logic should check if at least one of the dimensions `a` or `b` is even. If either is even, the answer is "Yes"; otherwise, it is "No".

Given the current implementation, the program will fail for cases where `a` is even and `b` is odd, or both `a` and `b` are odd. For example, for the input `3 2`, the program will incorrectly return "no" because it only checks `b`.

Correctness: **False**
