Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `combined` is not empty.
- Each iteration removes one tuple from `combined` and updates `current_profit` based on the conditions specified.
- The `heap` maintains the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values.
- `max_profit` is updated whenever `current_profit` exceeds the current `max_profit`.
- After all iterations, `combined` will be empty, and `current_profit` and `max_profit` will reflect the final and maximum profits, respectively.
