Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a non-empty sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but now missing one more tuple, `item` is the tuple that was removed from `combined`, `combined` is missing the `k` tuples with the highest bonus values plus the last two removed tuples, `removed_item` is the tuple that was pushed into `heap` and then popped out, `current_profit` is updated to `current_profit - removed_item[0]`, `current_profit` is further updated to `current_profit - item[1]` if `item[0] + item[1] >= 0` or to `current_profit + item[0]` if `item[0] + item[1] < 0`. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`; otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The line `current_profit -= removed_item[0]` updates the value of `current_profit` by subtracting the first element of `removed_item`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged as specified in the initial state.
