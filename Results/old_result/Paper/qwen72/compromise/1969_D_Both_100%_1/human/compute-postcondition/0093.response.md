To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's focus on the condition in the `while` loop head:

```python
while combined:
```

This condition checks if the list `combined` is non-empty. For the loop to execute at least once, `combined` must contain at least one element.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k` elements.

To ensure that the loop can execute at least once, `combined` must not be empty. Therefore, we need to ensure that `combined` has at least one element.

Since `combined` is described as being "missing its last `k` elements," we need to ensure that the original `combined` list had more than `k` elements to begin with. This way, even after removing the last `k` elements, `combined` will still have at least one element remaining.

Thus, the state adjustment needed is to ensure that the original `combined` list had more than `k` elements.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (each element is a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k` elements, and the original `combined` list must have had more than `k` elements, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, and `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
