To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the conditions that affect the loop head, which in this case is the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The other variables mentioned in the state do not directly influence the loop's ability to execute, but they are part of the initial state.

Given the loop head:
```
for _ in range(k):
    # the loop body is omit
```

We need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the state should reflect that `k` must be greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, `k` must be greater than 0**
