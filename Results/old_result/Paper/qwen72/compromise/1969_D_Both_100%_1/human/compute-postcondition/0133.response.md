Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the new `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after processing all items in `combined`, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The code `prices = list(func_2())` updates the `prices` variable to a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
- The `neg_prices` list is now derived from the new `prices` list, containing the negated values of the elements in `prices`.
- All other variables (`test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `bonuses`, `combined`, `current_profit`, and `max_profit`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
