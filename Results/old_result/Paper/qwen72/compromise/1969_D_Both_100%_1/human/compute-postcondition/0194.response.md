To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
   - `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from the original `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order) with the final `k` elements added and the smallest elements removed as necessary.
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list.
   - `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`.
   - `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list.
   - `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `combined` is now an empty list.
   - `current_profit` is the final calculated profit after processing all items in `combined`.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the entire loop execution.

2. **Key Points**:
   - `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the entire loop execution.
   - The loop processes items in `combined` to calculate `current_profit` and updates `max_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than the current `max_profit`.

3. **Final State**:
   - Since `k` is 0, it implies that no elements are being added to the `heap` or considered for further processing.
   - `combined` is now an empty list, meaning all items have been processed.
   - `max_profit` holds the maximum profit observed during the entire loop execution.

Given this information, the `print(max_profit)` statement will print the maximum profit observed during the entire loop execution.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit observed during the entire loop execution)**
