The only variable in the loop head is `combined`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `combined`. If `combined` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `combined` must not be empty. For the loop to execute one more time, `combined` must still not be empty.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` contains the last `k` tuples from `combined` (sorted by the bonus values in ascending order) with `item` added and the smallest element removed, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, and `combined` must not be empty, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)` minus `removed_item[0]` if `combined` is not empty and `removed_item` is not None, otherwise `current_profit` remains 0, `k` is 0, `item` is the last tuple removed from `combined`, and `removed_item` is the smallest element that was in the heap before `item` was added, or `None` if `removed_item` does not exist. If `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged.**
