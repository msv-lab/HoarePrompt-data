The code assigns the result of `func_3(combined, heap)` to the variable `current_profit`. Since the exact implementation of `func_3` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific value of `current_profit`. However, we know that `current_profit` is updated to the value returned by `func_3`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (each element is a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k` elements, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is 0, and `combined` is not empty.**
