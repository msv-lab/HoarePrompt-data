The code snippet `heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())` pushes the last element of the `combined` list onto the heap. Since `combined` is a sorted list of tuples, the last element of `combined` is the tuple with the highest bonus value. This tuple is removed from `combined` and added to `heap`.

Let's break down the changes:

- `heap` now contains one element, which is the tuple with the highest bonus value from `combined`.
- `combined` loses its last element, which was the tuple with the highest bonus value.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is a list containing the tuple with the highest bonus value from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but missing the tuple with the highest bonus value, `k` must be greater than 0, and `combined` is not empty.**
