You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n and k are non-negative integers such that 0 <= k <= n, prices is a list of integers representing the prices Alice pays for the items, bonuses is a list of integers representing the prices Bob pays for the items, and both prices and bonuses have the same length n.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        
        max_profit = 0
        
        current_profit = 0
        
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `test_cases` is 0, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are the values assigned from the last call to `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by the last call to `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the last `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by the last call to `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final calculated profit after processing all items in the last iteration, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the entire loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `test_cases`, a non-negative integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` where 0 <= k <= n, a list of integers `prices` representing the prices Alice pays for the items, and a list of integers `bonuses` representing the prices Bob pays for the items, with the same length as `prices`. The function computes and returns a result based on these inputs, though the specific output is not defined in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
