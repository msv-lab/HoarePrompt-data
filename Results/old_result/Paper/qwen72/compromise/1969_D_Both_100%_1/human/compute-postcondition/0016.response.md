The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the loop condition is based on the value of `k`. The loop will execute as long as there are iterations left, which is determined by the value of `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to have executed. After each iteration, `k` effectively decreases by 1, although this is not explicitly shown in the loop head. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect that `k` is now one less than it was at the end of the previous iteration, but still greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `heap` is either an empty list or a list containing the tuple with the highest bonus value from `combined`, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `max_profit` is 0, `current_profit` is 0, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains an element from `neg_prices` and the corresponding element from `bonuses`, sorted by the second element (bonuses) in ascending order, but if `combined` is not empty, it is missing the tuple with the highest bonus value, and `k` must be greater than 0 and one less than its value at the end of the previous iteration.**
