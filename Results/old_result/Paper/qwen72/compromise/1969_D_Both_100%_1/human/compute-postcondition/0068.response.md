Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is an empty list, `current_profit` is the final profit after processing all items, and `max_profit` is the maximum profit observed during the loop execution.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `k` are now assigned from the return values of `func_2()`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
