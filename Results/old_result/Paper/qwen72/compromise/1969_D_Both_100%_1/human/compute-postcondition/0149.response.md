The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `k`, so we can only adjust these. The loop can execute again if `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be greater than 0 (decremented by 1). For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be decremented by 1 again, so `k` must be greater than 1 at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is either an empty list or contains the last tuple from `combined` (which was the second-to-last tuple before the execution), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, but if `combined` was not empty, it is now missing its last tuple (or the last two tuples if the if condition was true), `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, and `k` must be greater than 1 (decremented by 1)**
