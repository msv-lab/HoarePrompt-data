The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. Since the loop does not depend on any other variables or lists being non-empty or having specific values, no other adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of the `prices` list, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses`, sorted by the bonus values in ascending order, `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
