The code snippet `item = combined.pop()` removes the last element from the `combined` list and assigns it to the variable `item`.

Let's analyze the impact:

- The `combined` list loses its last element.
- The `item` variable is assigned the value of the removed element, which is a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list (each element is a tuple consisting of a negated price and a corresponding bonus), `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus) but is now missing its last `k+1` elements, `current_profit` is the value returned by `func_3(combined, heap)`, `max_profit` is updated to `current_profit` if `current_profit` is greater than `max_profit`. Otherwise, `max_profit` remains unchanged, and `item` is the last element that was removed from `combined`.**
