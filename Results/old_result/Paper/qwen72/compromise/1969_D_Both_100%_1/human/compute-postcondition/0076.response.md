To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which in this case is just the variable `_` and the variable `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is greater than 0. The other variables mentioned in the state do not affect the loop's ability to execute directly, as they are not part of the loop head.

Given that `k` is assigned a value from `func_2()`, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it doesn't need to be initialized or adjusted before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to ensure `k` is greater than 0.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 1, `heap` is an empty list, `remaining_items` is an empty list, `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`, `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`, `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`, `combined` is a sorted list of tuples where each tuple contains a negated price from `neg_prices` and a corresponding bonus from `bonuses` (sorted by the bonus), `current_profit` is 0, `max_profit` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
