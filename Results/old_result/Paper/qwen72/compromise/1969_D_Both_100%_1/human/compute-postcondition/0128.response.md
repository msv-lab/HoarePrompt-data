To determine what will be printed by the `print(max_profit)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
   - `heap` is a list containing the last `k` elements of the original `combined` list, with elements possibly replaced during the loop execution.
   - `remaining_items` is an empty list.
   - `n` and `k` are assigned values from `func_2()`.
   - `prices` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `neg_prices` is a list containing the negated values of `prices`.
   - `bonuses` is a list containing the values returned by `func_2()`.
   - `combined` is an empty list.
   - `current_profit` is the final profit calculated after processing all items in `combined`.
   - `max_profit` is the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution.

2. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `max_profit` is the key variable here. It is described as the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution. This implies that `max_profit` is updated multiple times during the loop, and the final value stored in `max_profit` is the highest profit observed.

3. **Output Determination**:
   - Since the exact values of `prices`, `bonuses`, and the loop logic are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `max_profit`.
   - However, based on the initial state, we know that `max_profit` is the result of some profit calculation process that iterates over the `combined` list and updates `max_profit` with the highest profit found.

Given this information, the output of the `print(max_profit)` statement will be the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution.

Output: **max_profit (where max_profit is the maximum profit encountered during the loop execution)**
