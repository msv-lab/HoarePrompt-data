The only objects in the loop head are the list `res` and the variable `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `res` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` must be the third element of `res`.

State at the end of the previous iteration: `res` must be a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `res`.

For the loop to execute again:
- `res` must have at least 3 elements.
- `i` will be the third element of `res`.

State: **`res` must be a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `res`**
