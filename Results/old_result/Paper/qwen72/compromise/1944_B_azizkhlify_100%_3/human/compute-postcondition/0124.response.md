Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` integers where each element `l[a[j] - 1]` is incremented by the number of times `a[j]` appears in the list `a`, `r` is a list of `n` integers where `r[a[n] - 1]` is incremented by 1 and `r[a[i] - 1]` is incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `r[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` by 1.
- Since `i` is `n + 1`, the index `a[i] - 1` is `a[n + 1] - 1`.
- The value at `r[a[n + 1] - 1]` is incremented by 1.
- All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
