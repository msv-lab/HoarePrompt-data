The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with `l[a[0] - 1]` incremented by 1, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0**
