Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `res` contains all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `i` is the last element of `res` + 1, if `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ur` is increased by 2 for each element `a[i]` that had `r[a[i] - 1]` equal to 2, otherwise `ul` equals `ur` and the loop terminates; `n` and `k` are input integers.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` reads a line of input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`.
- The initial state variables `res`, `i`, `ul`, `ur`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, as the code snippet only affects the variable `a`.
- The precondition that `res` contains all the elements processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `i` is the last element of `res` + 1, and the conditions related to `ul` and `ur` remain valid.
- The input integers `n` and `k` are also still valid as they were not modified by the code snippet.
