Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is a list with all elements processed.
   - `i` is equal to `n`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - The value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0.
   - The code snippet prints `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - The value of `a[i]` is not explicitly given in the initial state.
   - However, we know that `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This implies that `a[i]` must be an index in the list `r` such that the element at `a[i] - 1` is 2.
   - Therefore, `a[i]` must be 3 (since `a[i] - 1` would be 2, and the index in `r` that corresponds to this value is 3).

5. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since `a[i]` is 3, the output will be `3 3 `.

Output: **3 3 **
