Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is the input integer, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1`, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is `2n - 1` and `n` must be greater than 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        l[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ul += 2
    if ul == k * 2:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[0] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2, otherwise `l` remains unchanged, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`, `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 0. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the program continues without breaking the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 1, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[0] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2, and the element at index `a[1] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[1] - 1]` was originally 2, otherwise `l` remains unchanged. `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`. `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2 or if `l[a[1] - 1]` was originally 2, otherwise `ul` remains 0. `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 1. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 2, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[0] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2, and the element at index `a[1] - 1` set to 0 if `l[a[1] - 1]` was originally 2. If `l[a[2] - 1]` was originally 2, it is now set to 0. `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`. `re` is 0, `ul` is 2 if `l[a[0] - 1]` was originally 2 or if `l[a[1] - 1]` was originally 2, otherwise `ul` is 2 if `l[a[2] - 1]` was originally 2. `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list, `i` is 2. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
