Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `res` must contain all the elements added during the loop execution, `i` will have iterated over each element in `res`, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 2 * n):
    if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
        print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
        r[a[i] - 1] = 0
        ur += 2
    if ul == ur:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n`. If `ul` is equal to `ur` and `r[a[n] - 1]` is 2, then `ur` is increased by 2, and `ul` is equal to `ur`. Otherwise, `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value, and `ul` is equal to `ur`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 1`, and `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ul` is equal to `ur + 2` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is 0. Otherwise, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, `ul` retains its original value and `r[a[i] - 1]` remains unchanged. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `ul` and `r[a[i] - 1]` retain their original values.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n + 2`, and `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `r[a[i] - 1]`, `ul`, and `ur` retain their original values. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, and `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0 and `ur` is increased by 2, while `ul` retains its original value. Otherwise, `r[a[i] - 1]` retains its original value, and both `ul` and `ur` retain their original values.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
