Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers input by the user, `k` is updated to `2 * k - ul`, `n` is the input integer and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` zeros with the elements at indices `a[i] - 1` set to 0 for each `i` in the range `0` to `n-1` where `l[a[i] - 1]` was originally 2, `r` is a list of `n` zeros with the element at index `a[i] - 1` incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range `n` to `2n-1`, `re` is 0 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, otherwise `re` is 1. `ul` is 2 times the number of elements in `a` that caused `l[a[i] - 1]` to be set to 0 (up to `k * 2`), `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` and the element at index `i` of `a`, `i` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, otherwise `i` is 2. If `re` is equal to `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
