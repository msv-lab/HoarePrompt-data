Postcondition: ***`res` contains all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `i` is the last element of `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is updated to the last element of `res` + (number of iterations - 1), and `ur` is increased by 2 for each element `a[i]` that had `r[a[i] - 1]` equal to 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop terminates without further changes to `ur`.***
