Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `res` is a list with all elements processed.
   - `i` is `n + 2`.
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - If `ul == ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0 and `ur` is `ur + 2`.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` was not 2, then the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` remain unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The variable `i` is set to `n + 2`.
   - The code snippet prints `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`**:
   - Since `i` is `n + 2`, we need to know the value of `a[n + 2]`.
   - The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `a[n + 2]`.
   - However, we know that `i` is `n + 2`, and `n` is greater than 1, so `i` is at least 3.

5. **Output**:
   - The code will print the value of `a[n + 2]` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since the exact value of `a[n + 2]` is not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

Output: **a[n + 2] a[n + 2] (where a[n + 2] is the element at index n + 2 in the list a)**
