Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `ul` is equal to `ur`.
   - `r[a[n] - 1]` retains its original value.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement is trying to print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.
   - `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 1, `i` will be at least 2 + 1 = 3.
   - The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but we know that `a[n]` is being referenced, which means `a` must have at least `n + 1` elements to avoid an index out of range error.
   - Therefore, `a[i]` (which is `a[n + 1]`) is being accessed, and we need to determine what this value is.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `a` is not explicitly defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `a[i]` (or `a[n + 1]`).
   - However, we can describe the value of `a[i]` based on the given information.

Output: **a[i], a[i] (where a[i] is the value of the element at index i in the list a, and i is n + 1)**
