Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and k is an integer such that 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    l = [0] * n
    r = [0] * n
    re = ul = ur = 0
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        l[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n, 2 * n):
        r[a[i] - 1] += 1
    for i in range(n):
        if l[a[i] - 1] == 2:
            print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
            l[a[i] - 1] = 0
            ul += 2
        if ul == k * 2:
            break
    k = 2 * k - ul
    if k:
        for i in range(n):
            if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
                print(a[i], end=' ')
                re += 1
                res.append(a[i])
            if re == k:
                break
    print()
    for i in res:
        print(i, end=' ')
    if ul != ur:
        for i in range(n, 2 * n):
            if r[a[i] - 1] == 2:
                print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
                r[a[i] - 1] = 0
                ur += 2
            if ul == ur:
                break
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`res` contains all the elements that were processed and had `l[a[i] - 1]` equal to 1, `i` is the last element of `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is updated to the last element of `res` + (number of iterations - 1), and `ur` is increased by 2 for each element `a[i]` that had `r[a[i] - 1]` equal to 2. If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop terminates without further changes to `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`res` contains all elements added during the loop execution, and `i` has iterated over each element in `res`. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is `2 * n - 1`, and `res` contains all elements added during the loop execution. If `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2 for any `i` in the range `[n, 2 * n)`, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0, and `ur` is increased by 2 for each occurrence. If at any point `ul` becomes equal to `ur`, the loop breaks, and `ul` and `ur` retain their values at that point. Otherwise, `ul` remains unchanged and is not equal to `ur`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`res` is a list with all elements processed. If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, `i` is set to `2 * n - 1`, `n` is greater than 0, and for each `i` in the range `n` to `2 * n - 1`, if `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `r[a[i] - 1]` is now 0 and `ur` is incremented by 2 for each such occurrence. If `ul` was equal to `ur` at any point during the loop execution, the loop would have broken out early, and the values of `r[a[i] - 1]` and `ur` would remain as they were at that point. Otherwise, if `ul` is equal to `ur`, `i` remains undefined or retains its value from the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
