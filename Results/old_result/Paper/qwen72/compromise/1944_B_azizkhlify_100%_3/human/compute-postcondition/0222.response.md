The code snippet `l[a[i] - 1] += 1` increments the value at the index `a[i] - 1` of the list `l` by 1. Given the initial state, `i` is 0, so the index used is `a[0] - 1`. The value at this index in `l` is incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, the value at index `a[0] - 1` in `l` is incremented by 1.**
