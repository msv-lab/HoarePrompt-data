Postcondition: ***`res` is a list with all elements processed, `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, and `ul` is not equal to `ur`. If `ul` was equal to `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` was 2, then `ur` is updated to `ur + 2` and `r[a[i] - 1]` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `ur` and `r[a[i] - 1]` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
