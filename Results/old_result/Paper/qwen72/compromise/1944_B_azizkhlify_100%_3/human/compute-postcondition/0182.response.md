The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `res`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `res`. If `res` has at least one element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `res` must contain at least one element. For the loop to execute one more time, `res` must still contain at least one element, and `i` will be the next element in the list.

Since the loop iterates over elements of `res`, and we are at the end of an iteration, the next element in `res` will be the one after the current `i`. If `res` has at least two elements, the loop will execute again with `i` being the second element.

State: **`res` must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `res`**
