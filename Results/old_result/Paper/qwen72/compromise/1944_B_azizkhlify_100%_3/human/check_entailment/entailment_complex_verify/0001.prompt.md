You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the final state is as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It prints pairs of integers from the first half of `a` until `k` pairs are printed or all pairs are exhausted. If more pairs are needed, it prints single integers from the first half of `a` until the required number of elements is printed. Finally, it prints any remaining integers from the second half of `a` that were not printed in the first phase. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - Two arrays `l` and `r` of length `n` are initialized to zero. These arrays will be used to count the occurrences of each element in the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively.
   - The variable `re` is initialized to 0, which will be used to count the number of elements added to the result.
   - The variables `ul` and `ur` are initialized to 0, which will be used to track the number of elements added to the left and right subsets, respectively.
   - The list `res` is initialized to store elements that will be used to fill the right subset.

3. **Filling the Left Subset:**
   - The function iterates over the first half of `a` and increments the count of each element in `l`.
   - It then iterates over the first half of `a` again to find elements that appear exactly twice in the first half. These elements are printed and their counts in `l` are reset to zero.
   - The variable `ul` is incremented by 2 for each pair of elements found.
   - If `ul` reaches `2k`, the loop breaks.

4. **Handling Remaining Elements for the Left Subset:**
   - If `ul` is less than `2k`, the function calculates the remaining number of elements needed (`k = 2 * k - ul`).
   - It then iterates over the first half of `a` again to find elements that appear exactly once in the first half. These elements are printed, and their counts in `l` are reset to zero.
   - The variable `re` is incremented for each element found, and the elements are stored in `res`.

5. **Filling the Right Subset:**
   - The function prints the elements stored in `res` to form the right subset.
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it iterates over the second half of `a` to find elements that appear exactly twice in the second half. These elements are printed and their counts in `r` are reset to zero.
   - The variable `ur` is incremented by 2 for each pair of elements found.
   - If `ul` equals `ur`, the loop breaks.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Use of `l` and `r` Arrays:**
   - The arrays `l` and `r` are used to count occurrences of elements, but they are not properly initialized to track the elements in the first and second halves of `a`. Instead, they should be initialized to track the elements in the first half and the second half separately.
   - The function does not correctly handle the elements in the second half of `a` to ensure that the right subset `r` is a valid subset of the second half.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Filling Subsets:**
   - The logic for filling the left subset `l` and the right subset `r` is flawed. The function should ensure that the subsets are formed from the first and second halves of `a` respectively, and that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` are equal.
   - The function does not correctly handle the case where elements need to be taken from the second half of `a` to form the right subset.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `ul` and `ur`:**
   - The variables `ul` and `ur` are used to track the number of elements added to the left and right subsets, but the function does not ensure that `ul` and `ur` are equal before breaking the loop.
