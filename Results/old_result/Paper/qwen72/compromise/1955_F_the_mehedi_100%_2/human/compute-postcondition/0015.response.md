Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, and `a` is a list of integers.
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` to be a new list of integers input by the user.
- The variable `cnt` is still the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`, but the list `a` has been updated.
- The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged.
- The output state reflects the updated list `a` and the unchanged values of `_` and `t`.
