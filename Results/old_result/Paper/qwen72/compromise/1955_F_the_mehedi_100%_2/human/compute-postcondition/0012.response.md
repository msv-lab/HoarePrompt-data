Output State: **_ is 0, t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, a is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, cnt is the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for all elements `x` in the list `a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `_` remains 0.
- The variable `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10,000.
- The list `a` must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations the loop performed.
- The variable `cnt` is updated to the sum of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element `x` in the list `a`. This means `cnt` will be the total of the integer division of each element in `a` by 2.
