Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by a list of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` which is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the list are all odd) and the floor division of each element in the list by 2. The function then prints this value for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. **
