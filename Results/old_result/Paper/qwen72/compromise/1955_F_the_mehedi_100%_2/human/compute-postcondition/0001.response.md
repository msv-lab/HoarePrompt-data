Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, the input to `range` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `t`, `a` is a list of integers.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on whitespace, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting integers in a list `a`. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged, and the input to `range` is still an integer within the specified range. The new variable `a` is now a list of integers.
