Output State: **`_` is 2, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(x / 2) if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise `cnt` is math.floor(x / 2), `x` is the second element in `a`.** 

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its previous value. The previous value of `cnt` was 1 if the first three elements of `a` were all odd, otherwise it was 0. The value of `x` is the second element in the list `a`. Therefore, the new value of `cnt` is 1 + math.floor(x / 2) if the first three elements of `a` are all odd, otherwise it is math.floor(x / 2). The values of `_`, `t`, and `a` remain unchanged.
