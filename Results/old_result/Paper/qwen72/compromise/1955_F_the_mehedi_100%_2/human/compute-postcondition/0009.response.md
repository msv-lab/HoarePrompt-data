Output State: **`_` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `cnt` is `cnt` + `math.floor(x / 2)`, `x` is the second integer in the list `a`**

Explanation:
- The value of `_` remains 0.
- The value of `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and must have at least two elements.
- The value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to its current value, where `x` is the second integer in the list `a`.
- The value of `x` remains the second integer in the list `a`.
