The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the permutation `p` and the array `a`, and an array `a` of length `n` with elements in the range -n to n (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for each test case.

The function returns a valid permutation `p` for each test case, which is an array of length `n` containing the integers from 1 to `n` in some order. The permutation `p` must satisfy the conditions specified by the array `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n` with elements in the range -n to n. It returns a valid permutation `p` of length `n` for each test case, where `p` is an array containing the integers from 1 to `n` in some order, and this permutation satisfies the conditions specified by `a`.**
