Reasoning:

The program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program's logic is based on the following observations:

1. **Positive `a_i` Values**:
   - If `a_i` is positive, it implies that `p_i` is the smallest number not yet used in the permutation up to this point. Therefore, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` to ensure the next smallest number is considered for the next positive `a_i`.

2. **Negative `a_i` Values**:
   - If `a_i` is negative, it implies that `p_i` is a number that is not the smallest missing number but is instead a number that has already been used or is larger. The program calculates `p_i` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends it to `mex`. It also updates `maxx` if the calculated `p_i` is greater than the current `maxx`.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `minn` and `maxx` are initialized to 0. `minn` keeps track of the smallest unused number, and `maxx` keeps track of the largest number used so far in the permutation.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `mex` as the reconstructed permutation `p`.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

1. **Handling of `minn` and `maxx`**:
   - The logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` is not entirely correct. Specifically, the condition `if minn == maxx` and the subsequent update `minn = maxx + 1` does not correctly handle the scenario where the smallest unused number should be the next in sequence.

2. **Correct Calculation of `p_i`**:
   - The calculation `abs(arr[i] - minn)` for negative `a_i` values is not accurate. The correct approach should be to determine the value of `p_i` such that `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i = a_i`.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided example:
     - For `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
       - `a_1 = 1` implies `p_1 = 0` (since `MEX(0) - 0 = 1`).
       - `a_2 = 1` implies `p_2 = 1` (since `MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1`).
       - `a_3 = -2` implies `p_3 = 4` (since `MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2`).
       - `a_4 = 1` implies `p_4 = 2` (since `MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1`).
       - `a_5 = 2` implies `p_5 = 3` (since `MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2`).

     The program does not correctly handle the negative values and the `minn` and `maxx` updates, leading to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
