### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) and the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.
   - Eve can remove one number at a time, and the sequence length decreases until it is empty.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.

3. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero as often as possible.
   - If the initial XOR is zero, Bob wins immediately.
   - If the initial XOR is non-zero, Eve should remove a number that will make the XOR zero in the next step.

4. **Counting the Numbers:**
   - The input provides the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - The XOR of the sequence can be determined by the counts of these numbers because:
     - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - The XOR of the sequence is zero if the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s are all even.

5. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula used in the program is: \( \text{sum}(3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \text{ for } i, x \text{ in } \text{enumerate}(\text{map}(\text{int}, \text{input}().\text{split}()))) // 3 \).
   - \( x // 2 \) gives the number of pairs of each number.
   - \( x \% 2 \) gives the remainder when \( x \) is divided by 2, which is 1 if \( x \) is odd and 0 if \( x \) is even.
   - \( 3 \times (x // 2) \) counts the number of pairs that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - \( x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) adds 1 to the count if the number of the current type is odd and the type is 1, 2, or 3 (but not 4).

6. **Dividing by 3:**
   - The final result is divided by 3 using integer division. This is because each pair of numbers can be removed to make the XOR zero, and the remainder (if any) can be used to make the XOR zero in the next step.

7. **Testing the Formula:**
   - For the given test cases:
     - \( 1, 1, 1, 0 \): The initial XOR is non-zero. Removing one 1 makes the XOR zero. Bob wins once.
     - \( 1, 0, 1, 2 \): The initial XOR is non-zero. Removing one 1 and one 3 makes the XOR zero. Bob wins once.
     - \( 2, 2, 2, 0 \): The initial XOR is zero. Bob wins three times.
     - \( 3, 3, 2, 0 \): The initial XOR is non-zero. Removing one 1 and one 2 makes the XOR zero. Bob wins three times.
     - \( 0, 9, 9, 9 \): The initial XOR is zero. Bob wins twelve times.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by calculating the number of pairs and the remainder for each type of number. The division by 3 ensures that the result is the maximum number of times Bob can win.

**Correctness: True**
