You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a series of test cases, each defined by a list of four integers representing counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours. For each test case, it calculates a result based on these counts, specifically summing a modified version of these counts and then performing integer division by 3. The function prints the results for each test case, one per line. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the input counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. The logic used in the program is based on the properties of the XOR operation and the distribution of the numbers.

The key insight is that the XOR of a sequence of numbers can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even) of the counts of each number. Specifically, the numbers 1 and 3 are odd in their binary representation, and the numbers 2 and 4 are even. The XOR of an even number of odd numbers is 0, and the XOR of an odd number of odd numbers is non-zero. Therefore, the goal is to remove numbers in such a way that the count of odd numbers (1 and 3) is minimized to maximize the number of times Bob wins (i.e., the XOR is 0).

The program uses the following formula to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win:
\[ \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum(3 \times \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor + (x \mod 2) \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor \]

Where:
- \( x \) is the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4).
- \( i \) is the index of the number in the sequence (0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4).

This formula effectively counts the number of pairs of odd numbers (1 and 3) that can be removed to make the XOR 0, and then adds any remaining odd numbers (if any) to the count. The division by 3 at the end ensures that the result is the maximum number of times Bob can win.

The program handles the input and output correctly, and the logic appears to be sound for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
