You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at the beginning of the game.
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum(3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for i, x in
    enumerate(map(int, input().split()))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))
    #This is printed: [result1]
    #[result2]
    #...
    #[resultT] (where result1, result2, ..., resultT are the integer results of the sum calculation for each test case, divided by 3 using integer division)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game with a sequence of integers, each of which is between 1 and 4.
   - The game is won by Bob if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers one by one to maximize the number of times Bob wins.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win given the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties**:
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Condition**:
   - Bob wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - Alice wins if the XOR of the remaining numbers is non-zero.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve**:
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - The XOR of the sequence can be simplified by considering the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s modulo 2 because:
     - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - Therefore, the XOR of the sequence depends on the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.

5. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The given program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the formula:
     \[
     \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum(3 \times \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor + (x \% 2) \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Here, \( x \) is the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) and \( i \) is the index (0 for 1s, 1 for 2s, 2 for 3s, 3 for 4s).
   - The term \( 3 \times \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor \) accounts for the pairs of numbers that can be removed to make the XOR zero.
   - The term \( (x \% 2) \times (i < 3) \) accounts for the remaining single number if the count is odd, but only for the first three numbers (1, 2, 3) because the fourth number (4) does not affect the XOR when it is the only remaining number.

6. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the formula with the provided examples:
     - For \( (1, 1, 1, 0) \):
       \[
       \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{3 \times 0 + 1 \times 1 + 3 \times 0 + 1 \times 0}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{3} \right\rfloor = 0
       \]
       However, the correct output is 1, which suggests a potential issue in the formula.
     - For \( (1, 0, 1, 2) \):
       \[
       \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{3 \times 0 + 1 \times 0 + 3 \times 0 + 1 \times 0}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{0}{3} \right\rfloor = 0
       \]
       The correct output is 1, which again suggests a potential issue.
     - For \( (2, 2, 2, 0) \):
       \[
       \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{3 \times 1 + 1 \times 0 + 3 \times 1 + 1 \times 0}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{6}{3} \right\rfloor = 2
       \]
       The correct output is 3, which further suggests a potential issue.
     - For \( (3, 3, 2, 0) \):
       \[
       \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{3 \times 1 + 1 \times 1 + 3 \times 1 + 1 \times 0}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{7}{3} \right\rfloor = 2
       \]
       The correct output is 3, which again suggests a potential issue.
     - For \( (0, 9, 9, 9) \):
       \[
       \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{3 \times 4 + 1 \times 1 + 3 \times 4 + 1 \times 1 + 3 \times 4 + 1 \times 1}{3} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{36}{3} \right\rfloor = 12
       \]
       The correct output is 12, which is correct.
