Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here is a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then reads `n` lines of constraints.

2. **Constraint Processing**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) and `bx` to -1. These variables will store the minimum upper bound and the maximum lower bound, respectively.
   - It uses a set `cx` to store the values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Constraint Types**:
   - For type 1 constraints (k must be greater than or equal to x), it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
   - For type 2 constraints (k must be less than or equal to x), it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
   - For type 3 constraints (k must not be equal to x), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the number of invalid integers (those in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`) from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program correctly handles all the constraints and ensures that the output is the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem requirements.
