### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (i.e., `k` must be not equal to `x`).
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the minimum upper bound for `k`.
   - It initializes `bx` to -1 to represent the maximum lower bound for `k`.

3. **Reading Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at least `bx`).
   - If `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x` (ensuring `k` is at most `ax`).
   - If `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx` (ensuring `k` is not equal to any value in `cx`).

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After reading all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, there are no valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, and it appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total range size `ax - bx + 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results stored in `r`, each on a new line.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints by updating the bounds `bx` and `ax` and storing the values to avoid in the set `cx`.
- The check `if bx > ax` ensures that if the lower bound is greater than the upper bound, the result is 0, which is correct.
- The calculation `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` correctly computes the number of valid integers `k` by considering the range and subtracting the invalid values.
- The use of a set for `cx` ensures that all values are unique, which is consistent with the problem's guarantee that no two constraints are the same.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
