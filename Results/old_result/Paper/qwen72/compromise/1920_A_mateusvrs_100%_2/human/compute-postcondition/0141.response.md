Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cx` is a set that must have at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `cx`, `bx` is less than or equal to `ax`, `tmp` is 1 if the second element in `cx` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, otherwise `tmp` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1, so `tmp` is now 1 regardless of its previous value (which was 0 or 1).
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
