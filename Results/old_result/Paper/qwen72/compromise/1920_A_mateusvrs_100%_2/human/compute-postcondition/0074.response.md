Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder (not adjusted), `a` and `x` are integers provided by the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to `a` and `x`. The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged. The new values of `a` and `x` are now the integers provided by the user. The conditions for `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as described in the initial state.
