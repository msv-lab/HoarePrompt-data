Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer. If `a` == 1, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 1. If `a` == 2, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values encountered for `a` == 2. Otherwise, `x` is added to the set `cx` for all `a` values not equal to 1 or 2. The current value of `bx` is greater than the current value of `ax`. The list `r` has a new element 0 appended to it.**
