The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute. The placeholder `_` is incremented by 1 during each iteration but does not affect the loop's execution condition. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `_` should start at 0.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
