To determine what will be printed by the `print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **List `a`**:
   - Starts with `-1000000000.0`.
   - Followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`.
   - Ends with `2000000000.0`.

2. **List `b`**:
   - Starts with `[0, 0]`.
   - Appends `t + 2` new elements, each of which is the sum of the previous two elements in `b` plus a value determined by the condition `v > x - w` or `v > z - y`.

3. **Variables**:
   - `t`: Remains unchanged.
   - `u`: One less than its previous value (which was the first value returned by `r()` and evaluated to `True`).
   - `c`: The next value returned by `r()`.
   - `d`: The next value after `c` returned by `r()`.
   - `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **List `a`**:
   - `a = [-1000000000.0, r(), r(), ..., r(), 2000000000.0]` (total length is `t + 4`).

2. **List `b`**:
   - `b = [0, 0, b[0] + b[1] + condition_value, b[1] + b[2] + condition_value, ...]` (total length is `t + 4`).
   - Each new element in `b` is calculated as `b[i] = b[i-1] + b[i-2] + condition_value`, where `condition_value` is determined by the condition `v > x - w` or `v > z - y`.

3. **Indices for `b`**:
   - `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` are the indices used to access elements in `b`.
   - Since `c` and `d` are values returned by `r()`, and `c >= d`, the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` will be valid indices within the range of `b`.

4. **Calculation**:
   - `b[c * 2 - 1]` and `b[d * 2 - 1]` are specific elements in `b`.
   - The difference `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]` is computed.

### Final Output:
Given the initial state and the logic described, the output of the `print` statement will be the difference between the elements at the indices `c * 2 - 1` and `d * 2 - 1` in the list `b`.

Output: **b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1] (where c and d are values returned by r() and c >= d)**
