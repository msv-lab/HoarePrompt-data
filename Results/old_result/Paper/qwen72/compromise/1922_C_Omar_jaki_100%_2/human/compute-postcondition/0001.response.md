The code snippet reads an integer value for `t` using the function `r()`. This function is assumed to read multiple integers from a single line of input, and in this case, it reads only one integer which is assigned to `t`.

Given the initial state, `t` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. After executing the code, the value of `t` is updated to the specific integer read from the input.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input, representing the number of test cases. The rest of the initial state remains unchanged: each test case consists of `n` (an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` (an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` (where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
