To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables:

### Initial State:
- `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` must have at least 5 elements.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y)]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.
- `w` is the 2nd element of `a`.
- `x` is the 3rd element of `a`.
- `y` is the 4th element of `a`.
- `z` is the 5th element of `a`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the current state of `b`:**
   - `b` is initially `[0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y)]`.
   - Let's denote the elements of `b` as follows:
     - `b[0] = 0`
     - `b[1] = 0`
     - `b[2] = v`
     - `b[3] = 0 + v * (v > x - w)`
     - `b[4] = v + v * (v > z - y)`

2. **Calculate the new elements to be appended to `b`:**
   - The first new element is `b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w)`.
     - `b[-2]` is `b[3]`, which is `0 + v * (v > x - w)`.
     - `v ** (v > x - w)` is `v` if `v > x - w` is true, otherwise it is `1`.
     - Therefore, the first new element is `0 + v * (v > x - w) + v ** (v > x - w)`.
   - The second new element is `b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`.
     - `b[-1]` is `b[4]`, which is `v + v * (v > z - y)`.
     - `v ** (v > z - y)` is `v` if `v > z - y` is true, otherwise it is `1`.
     - Therefore, the second new element is `v + v * (v > z - y) + v ** (v > z - y)`.

3. **Update `b` with the new elements:**
   - The new `b` will be:
     - `b = [0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y), 0 + v * (v > x - w) + v ** (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y) + v ** (v > z - y)]`.

### Output State:
- `t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0.
- `a` must have at least 5 elements.
- `b` is `[0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y), 0 + v * (v > x - w) + v ** (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y) + v ** (v > z - y)]`.
- `v` is `y - x`.
- `w` is the 2nd element of `a`.
- `x` is the 3rd element of `a`.
- `y` is the 4th element of `a`.
- `z` is the 5th element of `a`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer read from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` must have at least 5 elements, `b` is `[0, 0, v, 0 + v * (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y), 0 + v * (v > x - w) + v ** (v > x - w), v + v * (v > z - y) + v ** (v > z - y)]`, `v` is `y - x`, `w` is the 2nd element of `a`, `x` is the 3rd element of `a`, `y` is the 4th element of `a`, `z` is the 5th element of `a`.**
