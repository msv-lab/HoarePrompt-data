Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is the integer read from the input minus 2 and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list with the first element being `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will contain `t + 2` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. `u` is a single value returned by `r()`.
Code of the loop:
while u:
    u -= 1
    c, d = r()
    if c < d:
        print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
    else:
        print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is the integer read from the input minus 2 and must be greater than 0. `a` is a list with the first element being `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will contain `t + 2` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. `u` is now one less than its original value. `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is the integer read from the input minus 2 and must be greater than 0. `a` is a list with the first element being `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will contain `t + 2` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. `u` is two less than its original value and must be non-zero. `c` and `d` are the values returned by the function `r()`. If `c` is less than `d`, the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is the integer read from the input minus 2 and must be greater than 0. `a` is a list with the first element being `-1000000000.0`, followed by `t + 2` values returned by `r()`, and ending with `2000000000.0`. The list `b` will contain `t + 2` elements, where each element is calculated based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and the conditions specified in the loop. `u` is three less than its original value and must be non-zero. `c` and `d` are the new values returned by the function `r()`. If the new `c` is less than the new `d`, the current value of `c` is less than the current value of `d`. Otherwise, `c` is greater than or equal to `d`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
