Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Cases**:
   - The logic for generating the word is flawed. The conditions `if n > 52`, `elif n > 26`, and `else` do not correctly handle all possible values of `n` to generate the lexicographically smallest word.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - For `n > 52`, the program adds the character `alphabet[n - 53]` followed by `zz`. This is incorrect because it does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - For `26 < n <= 52`, the program adds `a` followed by `alphabet[n - 28]` and `z`. This is also incorrect for the same reason.
   - For `n <= 26`, the program adds `aa` followed by `alphabet[n - 3]`. This is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n` is less than or equal to 26 correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, you should start from the smallest possible characters and incrementally build the word to match the sum `n`.
   - The correct approach involves iterating from the smallest possible values and adjusting the characters to ensure the sum matches `n`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        for j in range(3):
            for k in range(26):
                if n - (k + 1) >= 0:
                    word += alphabet[k]
                    n -= (k + 1)
                    break
        print(word)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the word is built lexicographically smallest by starting with the smallest possible characters and adjusting as needed to match the sum `n`.
