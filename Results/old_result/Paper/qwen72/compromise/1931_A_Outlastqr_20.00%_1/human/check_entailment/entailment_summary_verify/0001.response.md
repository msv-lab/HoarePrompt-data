Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded integer `n`. This is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Alphabet Initialization**: The program initializes the alphabet using `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. This is correct and useful for mapping indices to letters.

3. **Word Construction**:
   - **Case 1: \( n > 52 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 53 \) followed by "zz".
     - This is correct because the maximum sum of three letters (each with the highest index 26) is 78. If \( n > 52 \), the first letter must be at least 'r' (index 18), and the remaining two letters must be 'z' (index 26) to maximize the sum.
   - **Case 2: \( 26 < n \leq 52 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding 'a' followed by the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 28 \) and then 'z'.
     - This is correct because the sum of the first letter 'a' (index 1) and the third letter 'z' (index 26) is 27. Therefore, the second letter must be \( n - 27 \), and the range \( 26 < n \leq 52 \) ensures that \( n - 27 \) is a valid index (1 to 26).
   - **Case 3: \( n \leq 26 \)**:
     - The program constructs the word by adding 'aa' followed by the letter corresponding to the index \( n - 3 \).
     - This is incorrect. The sum of the first two letters 'aa' (each with index 1) is 2, not 3. Therefore, the third letter should be \( n - 2 \), not \( n - 3 \). For example, if \( n = 3 \), the correct word should be "aab" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3), not "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).

4. **Output**: The program prints the constructed word for each test case, which is the correct format for the output.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly for \( n = 52 \) and \( n = 78 \):
     - For \( n = 52 \), the word is "azz" (1 + 26 + 25 = 52).
     - For \( n = 78 \), the word is "zzz" (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).
   - However, for \( n = 3 \), the word should be "aab" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3), not "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).

6. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by:
     - Using 'a' as the first letter whenever possible.
     - Using 'z' as the last letter whenever possible to maximize the sum with the smallest possible first and second letters.
     - Using the smallest possible letter for the second position when the first letter is 'a'.
   - However, the error in the third case means that for \( n = 3 \), the word "aaa" is not the lexicographically smallest word.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the error in the third case where the index calculation for the third letter is off by 1.

Final: **False**
