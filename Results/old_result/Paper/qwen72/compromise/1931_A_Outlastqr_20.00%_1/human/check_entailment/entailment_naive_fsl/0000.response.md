Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Here are a few examples where the program fails:

1. **Input: 78**
   - Expected Output: `zzz`
   - Actual Output: `aaz`
   - Explanation: The program incorrectly constructs the word by adding 'aaz' when the correct word should be 'zzz'. The logic for handling the maximum value (78) is not correctly implemented.

2. **Input: 51**
   - Expected Output: `ayz`
   - Actual Output: `ayz`
   - Explanation: The program correctly outputs 'ayz' for this input, but it does not handle other cases correctly.

3. **Input: 27**
   - Expected Output: `aab`
   - Actual Output: `aaz`
   - Explanation: The program incorrectly constructs the word by adding 'aaz' when the correct word should be 'aab'. The logic for handling values just above 26 is not correctly implemented.

4. **Input: 52**
   - Expected Output: `aaz`
   - Actual Output: `aaz`
   - Explanation: The program correctly outputs 'aaz' for this input, but it does not handle other cases correctly.

5. **Input: 28**
   - Expected Output: `aba`
   - Actual Output: `aaz`
   - Explanation: The program incorrectly constructs the word by adding 'aaz' when the correct word should be 'aba'. The logic for handling values just above 27 is not correctly implemented.

The program needs to be revised to correctly handle all potential cases for constructing the lexicographically smallest word.
