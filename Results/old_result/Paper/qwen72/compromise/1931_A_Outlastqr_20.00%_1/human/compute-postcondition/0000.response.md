The provided Python code snippet initializes the variable `alphabet` with the value of `string.ascii_lowercase`, which is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. The variable `n` is not affected by this code, and its value remains within the specified range (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).

Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters. `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.**
