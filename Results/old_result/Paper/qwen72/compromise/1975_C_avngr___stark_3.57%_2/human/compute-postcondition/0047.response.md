Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, and `max` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration unless the minimum value between `a[3]` and `a[2]` is greater than `max`, in which case `max` is updated to this minimum value.***
