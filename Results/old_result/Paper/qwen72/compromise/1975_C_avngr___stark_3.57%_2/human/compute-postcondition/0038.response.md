The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, because the range function will generate numbers from 1 up to but not including `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `n - 1`
- `n` is the new input integer

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `i` in the loop head will start from 1, not from `n - 1` as given in the initial state.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 1 and `i` starts from 1 as required by the loop.

State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `max` is 0**
