Output State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is the new input integer, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is `n - 1`, `max` holds the maximum value among the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a` from index 1 to `n-1`.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the variable `a` to a new list of integers provided by the user.
- The initial state mentions that `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, which is now updated.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, and `max`) remain unchanged in their descriptions, as the provided code only affects the variable `a`.
