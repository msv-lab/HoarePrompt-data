The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3.

State: **`t` is `t - 2`, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a new list of integers input by the user, `i` is 3, and `max` is the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration. If the minimum value between `a[2]` and `a[1]` is greater than `max`, then `max` is updated to this minimum value. Otherwise, `max` remains unchanged.**
