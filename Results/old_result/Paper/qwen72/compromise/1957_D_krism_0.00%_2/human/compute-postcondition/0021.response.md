The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to one of the test cases. The result for each test case is based on the input list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the input list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.**
