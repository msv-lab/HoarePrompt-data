Output State: **The `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` will be `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) will remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each of which is `[0, 0]`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each of which is `[0, 0]`.**
