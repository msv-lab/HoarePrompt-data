You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be: `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    #This is printed: -----------------
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
        
    #State: The `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` will be `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) will remain unchanged.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: [a1, a2, a3, ..., an], [0, a1, a1 ^ a2, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3, ..., a1 ^ a2 ^ ... ^ an] (where `a1, a2, a3, ..., an` are the elements of the list `arr`)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` will be `n + 1`, where `n` is the length of `arr`. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `arr`) will remain unchanged. `pre` is a list of 32 sublists, each of which is `[1, 0]`. `suf` is a list of 32 sublists, each of which is `[0, 0]`.
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
        
    #State: The `prefix` list remains unchanged, containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` variables remain unchanged. The `suf` list now contains the count of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (which is 0). Each sublist in `suf` will have the format `[count_of_0s, count_of_1s]` for the corresponding bit position.
    print(pre)
    #This is printed: prefix (where prefix is a list of length n + 1 containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in arr, starting with 0)
    print(suf)
    #This is printed: [[2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 1], [4, 1], [5, 0], [5, 0], ..., [5, 0]] (where the list contains 32 sublists, each representing the count of 0s and 1s at the corresponding bit position for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
        
    #State: The `prefix` list remains unchanged, containing the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr`, starting with 0. The length of `prefix` is `n + 1`. The `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `arr` variables remain unchanged. The `suf` list now contains the count of 1s and 0s at each bit position (from 0 to 31) for the elements in the `prefix` list, excluding the first element (which is 0), but all counts are 0. The `ans` variable is the final result of the loop, which is the sum of the products of the counts of 0s and 1s at each bit position for each element in `arr`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the input list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
