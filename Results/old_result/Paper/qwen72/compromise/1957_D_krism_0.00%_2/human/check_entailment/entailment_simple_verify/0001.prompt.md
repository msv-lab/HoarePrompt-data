You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr`.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR array `prefix` where `prefix[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `arr`.
   - This is done using a loop that iterates through the array and updates the prefix XOR.

3. **Pre and Suf Arrays:**
   - The program initializes two arrays `pre` and `suf`, each of size 32 (to handle 32-bit integers) and each element is a list of two zeros.
   - `pre[i][0]` and `pre[i][1]` keep track of the count of prefix XOR values that have the i-th bit as 0 and 1, respectively.
   - `suf[i][0]` and `suf[i][1]` keep track of the count of suffix XOR values that have the i-th bit as 0 and 1, respectively.
   - Initially, `pre[i][0]` is incremented by 1 for all `i` (since the prefix XOR starts with 0).

4. **Suffix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the array in reverse to populate the `suf` array.
   - For each element, it updates the `suf` array based on the current prefix XOR value.

5. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0 to store the count of valid tuples.
   - For each element in the array, it calculates the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` where `y` is the current element.
   - It uses the `bit_length` of the current element to determine the most significant bit and updates the count of valid tuples based on the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
   - It then updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays to reflect the current element being processed.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the count of valid tuples for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly calculates the prefix XOR array.
- The `pre` and `suf` arrays are used to efficiently count the number of valid tuples by leveraging the properties of the XOR operation and the bit representation of numbers.
- The logic for updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays and counting the valid tuples is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Issues:
- The function `func_1` is called within the loop for each test case, but it is not defined before the loop. This will cause a `NameError` in Python.
- The program prints intermediate results (`arr`, `prefix`, `pre`, `suf`) which are not required by the problem statement and can be removed for a cleaner solution.
- The logic for counting valid tuples might be incorrect. The program should count tuples where `f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z)`, but the current logic seems to be counting based on bit positions, which may not be correct.

### Conclusion:
The program has some issues that need to be addressed, particularly the incorrect function call and the logic for counting valid tuples. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
