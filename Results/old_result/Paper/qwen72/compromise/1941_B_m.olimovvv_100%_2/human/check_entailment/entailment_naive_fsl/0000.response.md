Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is that the program does not properly check if the elements at indices `i+1` and `i+2` become negative after the operations, which is a requirement for the problem. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
0 1 3 3 1
```

The expected output is "YES" because the array can be made all zeros with the following operations:

1. Apply the operation at `i=2` to get the array `[0, 0, 1, 3, 1]`.
2. Apply the operation at `i=3` to get the array `[0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`.
3. Apply the operation at `i=4` to get the array `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.

However, the program will output "NO" because it does not handle the case where the elements at `i+1` and `i+2` become negative correctly. The program only checks if the elements at the end of the array are zero, but it does not ensure that all intermediate elements remain non-negative throughout the process.
