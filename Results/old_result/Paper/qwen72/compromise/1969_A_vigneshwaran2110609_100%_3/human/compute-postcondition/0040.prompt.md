Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is `x`, `x` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, x):
    if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
        flag = True
        print(2)
        break
else:
    print(3)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is 0, `x` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then `l[0]` is 1, `l[1]` is 1, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is 1, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, then `l[0]` is 1, `l[1]` is 1, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `p` is a list of integers where each `p_i` satisfies 1 <= `p_i` <= `n` and `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct, `i` is 2, `x` is an input integer greater than 1, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `flag` remains unchanged. If `l[l[2] - 1] == 3`, then `l[0]` is 1, `l[1]` is 1, and `flag` is True. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
