### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers where each integer is between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes numbers one by one to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - XOR is commutative and associative: \( a \oplus b = b \oplus a \) and \( (a \oplus b) \oplus c = a \oplus (b \oplus c) \).

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the total XOR of the sequence is zero, Bob wins.
   - If the total XOR of the sequence is non-zero, Alice wins.

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining sequence is zero as often as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve should focus on removing pairs of numbers that cancel each other out (i.e., pairs of the same number).

5. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula used in the program is: \( \text{sum}(3 \times (x // 2) + x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \text{ for } i, x \text{ in } \text{enumerate}(\text{map}(\text{int}, \text{input}().\text{split()}))) // 3 \).
   - \( x // 2 \) gives the number of complete pairs of \( x \).
   - \( x \% 2 \) gives the remainder when \( x \) is divided by 2, which is 1 if \( x \) is odd and 0 if \( x \) is even.
   - \( 3 \times (x // 2) \) accounts for the number of complete pairs, each contributing 3 to the sum.
   - \( x \% 2 \times (i < 3) \) adds 1 to the sum if \( x \) is odd and \( i \) is less than 3 (i.e., for the first three numbers in the sequence).

6. **Dividing by 3:**
   - The final result is divided by 3, which effectively counts the number of complete pairs and adds a fraction of the remaining odd numbers.

7. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the given test cases, the formula seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win:
     - **Test Case 1: \(1, 1, 1, 0\)**: One complete pair of 1s, so Bob wins once.
     - **Test Case 2: \(1, 0, 1, 2\)**: One complete pair of 1s, so Bob wins once.
     - **Test Case 3: \(2, 2, 2, 0\)**: Three complete pairs, so Bob wins three times.
     - **Test Case 4: \(3, 3, 2, 0\)**: Three complete pairs, so Bob wins three times.
     - **Test Case 5: \(0, 9, 9, 9\)**: Nine complete pairs, so Bob wins twelve times (since \(9 // 2 = 4\) and \(4 \times 3 = 12\)).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The formula used is consistent with the problem's requirements and the test cases provided.

Correctness: **True**
