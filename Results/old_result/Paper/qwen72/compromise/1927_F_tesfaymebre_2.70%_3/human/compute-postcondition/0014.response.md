To determine what will be printed by the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the operations that lead to the values of `_min_edge` and `res`.

### Initial State:
1. **`n` and `m` remain unchanged**: These are constants representing the number of nodes and edges, respectively.
2. **`edges` is a sorted list of `m` tuples in descending order**: Each tuple is of the form `(w, u, v)` where `w` is the weight of the edge, and `u` and `v` are the nodes connected by the edge. The list is sorted in descending order of edge weights.
3. **`graph` is a defaultdict of type list**: Each key `u` has a list of values `v` that were appended during the loop iterations. This represents the adjacency list of the graph.
4. **`dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1` and modified by the union operations**: `DSU` (Disjoint Set Union) is used to manage the connected components of the graph. It is initialized with `n + 1` elements and modified by union operations.
5. **`_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were successfully unioned**: This variable holds the smallest weight of the edges that were successfully added to the union-find structure.
6. **`node_u` is the node involved in the union operation that resulted in the minimum edge weight**: This is one of the nodes connected by the edge with the minimum weight.
7. **`node_v` is the other node involved in the same union operation**: This is the other node connected by the edge with the minimum weight.
8. **`colors` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with all zeros**: This list is used to keep track of the colors (or labels) of the nodes.
9. **`res` is the result of the `dfs` function call starting from `node_u` with a parent of `-1` and an empty list as the initial path**: `res` is the path found by the depth-first search (DFS) starting from `node_u`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Sorting and Union Operations**:
   - The `edges` list is sorted in descending order of edge weights.
   - Union operations are performed on the edges starting from the highest weight to the lowest weight.
   - The union operation is successful if the two nodes `u` and `v` are not already in the same set.

2. **Finding `_min_edge`**:
   - As the union operations proceed, the smallest weight of the edges that were successfully unioned is stored in `_min_edge`.
   - This means `_min_edge` will be the weight of the last edge that was successfully unioned, which is the smallest weight among all successfully unioned edges.

3. **DFS Path**:
   - The `dfs` function is called starting from `node_u` with a parent of `-1` and an empty list as the initial path.
   - The `dfs` function will explore all nodes connected to `node_u` and return the path.
   - The length of this path is stored in `len(res)`.

### Output Calculation:
- **_min_edge**: This is the minimum weight of the edges that were successfully unioned. Since the edges are sorted in descending order, the last edge that was successfully unioned will have the smallest weight.
- **len(res)**: This is the length of the path found by the DFS starting from `node_u`. The path will include all nodes that are connected to `node_u` in the graph.

### Final Output:
Output: **_min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges that were successfully unioned, and len(res) is the length of the path found by the DFS starting from node_u)**

This output provides a precise description of what will be printed based on the given initial state and the operations described.
