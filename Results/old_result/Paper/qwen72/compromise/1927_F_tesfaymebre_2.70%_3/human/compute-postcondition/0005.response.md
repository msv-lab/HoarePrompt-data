The only objects in the loop head are `nei` and `graph[curr]`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `graph[curr]`. If `graph[curr]` has at least one neighbor, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `curr` is a vertex in the graph, and `graph[curr]` should be a list of neighbors of `curr`. For the loop to execute, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, and `nei` should be the first neighbor in `graph[curr]`.

State: **`curr` is a vertex in the graph, `parent` is the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal (or None if `curr` is the root), `path` is a list of vertices representing the current path in the DFS traversal with `curr` appended to it, the color of `curr` is 1, `graph[curr]` must have at least one neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor in `graph[curr]`**
