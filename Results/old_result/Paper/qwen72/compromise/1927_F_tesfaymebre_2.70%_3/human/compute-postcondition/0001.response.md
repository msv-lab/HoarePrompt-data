The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will be assigned values from 0 to `test_cases - 1` during the loop execution.

Since the loop depends on `test_cases`, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be set by the loop itself.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0**
