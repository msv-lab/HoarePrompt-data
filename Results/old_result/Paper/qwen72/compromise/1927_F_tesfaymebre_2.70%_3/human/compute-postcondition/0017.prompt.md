You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), and edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) where 1 <= u, v <= n, u != v, and 1 <= w <= 10^6.
def func_6():
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `edges` is a list of `m` tuples where each tuple is of the form `(w, u, v)` as returned by `func_3()`, and `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of values `v` that were appended during the loop iterations.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    node_u = -1
    node_v = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
            if dsu.min_edge[parent_u] < _min_edge:
                _min_edge = dsu.min_edge[parent_u]
                node_u = u
                node_v = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v, w)
        
    #State: `n` and `m` remain unchanged, `edges` is a sorted list of `m` tuples in descending order where each tuple is of the form `(w, u, v)` as returned by `func_3()`, `graph` is a defaultdict of type list where each key `u` has a list of values `v` that were appended during the loop iterations, `dsu` is an instance of the `DSU` class initialized with `n + 1` and modified by the union operations, `_min_edge` is the minimum weight of the edges that were successfully unioned, `node_u` is the node involved in the union operation that resulted in the minimum edge weight, `node_v` is the other node involved in the same union operation.
    colors = [0] * (n + 1)
    res = dfs(node_u, -1, [])
    print(_min_edge, len(res))
    #This is printed: _min_edge, len(res) (where _min_edge is the minimum weight of the edges that were successfully unioned, and len(res) is the length of the path found by the DFS starting from node_u)
    print(*res)
    #This is printed: [nodes visited during the DFS starting from node_u] (where node_u is the node involved in the union operation that resulted in the minimum edge weight)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`, where `n` and `m` are non-negative integers with 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5), and `edges` is a list of tuples (w, u, v) representing weighted edges in a graph. The function returns a value based on the input parameters.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
