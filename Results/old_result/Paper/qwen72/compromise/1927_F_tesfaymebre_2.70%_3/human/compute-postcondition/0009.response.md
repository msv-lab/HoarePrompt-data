The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is a vertex in the graph, `parent` is the parent vertex of `curr` in the DFS traversal (or `None` if `curr` is the root), and `path` is a list of vertices representing the current path in the DFS traversal.

Output:
- Case_1: The function returns the list of vertices representing the current path in the DFS traversal.
- Case_2: The function returns an empty list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a current vertex `curr`, a parent vertex `parent` (or `None` if `curr` is the root), and a list `path` representing the current path in the DFS traversal. It returns the current path if the traversal is successful. If the traversal does not find a valid path, it returns an empty list.**
