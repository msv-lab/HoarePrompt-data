The function `dfs` performs a depth-first search in a graph. It accepts a current vertex `curr`, a parent vertex `parent` (or `None` if `curr` is the root), and a list `path` representing the current path in the DFS traversal. The function marks the current vertex as visited (color 1) and appends it to the path. If a cycle is detected (i.e., the current vertex is revisited while its color is 1), the function returns the current path. If the function completes the traversal without finding a cycle, it marks the current vertex as fully processed (color 2) and returns an empty list.
