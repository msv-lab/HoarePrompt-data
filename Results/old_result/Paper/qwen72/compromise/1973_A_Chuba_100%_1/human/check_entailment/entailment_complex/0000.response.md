### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. It is guaranteed that `1 <= t <= 500`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (where `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`). This input is valid as per the problem description.

2. **Sum Check**:
   - The function checks if the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd. If it is, the function prints `-1` because it is impossible to achieve an odd total score with the given scoring system (each game results in either 2 points or 2 points in a draw).
   - This check is correct because the sum of scores must be even for the scores to be consistent with the game rules.

3. **Draw Calculation**:
   - If the sum is even, the function calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`.
   - The formula is derived from the following observations:
     - The total number of points distributed in a game is always 2 (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).
     - To maximize the number of draws, we need to minimize the number of wins. The difference `v[2] - v[0] - v[1]` represents the excess points that the highest scorer has over the other two players. If this difference is positive, it means some games must have been won by the highest scorer.
     - The term `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` ensures that we only subtract the excess points if they are positive.
     - The formula then divides the remaining points by 2 to get the maximum number of draws.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the result for each test case, either the maximum number of draws or `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and uses a valid formula to calculate the maximum number of draws.

### Correctness:
**True**
