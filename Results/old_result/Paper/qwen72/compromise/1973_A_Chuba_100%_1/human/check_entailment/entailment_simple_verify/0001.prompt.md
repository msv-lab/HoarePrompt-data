You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers from the input, checks if their sum is odd, and if so, prints `-1`. If the sum is even, it calculates a result based on the formula provided and prints the result. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not affected by the loop and remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `v[0]`, `v[1]`, and `v[2]` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Odd Total Score Check:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2])` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` because the total score must be even. This is because each game results in either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it is a draw), and thus the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating Maximum Draws:**
   - The program calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula:
     \[
     \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2}
     \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - `v[0] + v[1] + v[2]` is the total score.
     - `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` is the maximum number of points that the highest-scoring player (`v[2]`) could have gained from winning games against the other two players. If `v[2]` is less than or equal to `v[0] + v[1]`, this term is 0.
     - Subtracting `max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])` from the total score gives the number of points that could have been distributed as draws.
     - Dividing by 2 gives the number of draws, since each draw results in 2 points being distributed.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `0 0 0`
   - Total score: `0 + 0 + 0 = 0` (even)
   - `max(0, 0 - 0 - 0) = 0`
   - Result: \(\frac{0 - 0}{2} = 0\)
   - Output: `0` (Correct)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `0 1 1`
   - Total score: `0 + 1 + 1 = 2` (even)
   - `max(0, 1 - 0 - 1) = 0`
   - Result: \(\frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1\)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - Total score: `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `1 1 2`
   - Total score: `1 + 1 + 2 = 4` (even)
   - `max(0, 2 - 1 - 1) = 0`
   - Result: \(\frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2\)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `3 3 3`
   - Total score: `3 + 3 + 3 = 9` (odd)
   - Output: `-1` (Correct)

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `3 4 5`
   - Total score: `3 + 4 + 5 = 12` (even)
   - `max(0, 5 - 3 - 4) = 0`
   - Result: \(\frac{12 - 0}{2} = 6\)
   - Output: `6` (Correct)

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `1 1 10`
   - Total score: `1 + 1 + 10 = 12` (even)
   - `max(0, 10 - 1 - 1) = 8`
   - Result: \(\frac{12 - 8}{2} = 2\)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws or if the scores are inconsistent. Therefore, the program is correct.
