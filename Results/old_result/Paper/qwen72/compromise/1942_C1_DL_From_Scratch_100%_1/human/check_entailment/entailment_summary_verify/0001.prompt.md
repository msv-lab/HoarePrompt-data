You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

- Program:
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        count = 0
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, where `n` is the number of sides of a polygon, `x` is the number of chosen vertices, and `y` is a fixed value (0). It then reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. The function calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between the sorted chosen vertices and adds this count to `x - 2`. It prints this result for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Bessie has a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - She has chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake using the chosen vertices.
   - In this version, \( y = 0 \), meaning we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - A triangle is formed by three vertices of the polygon.
   - To maximize the number of triangles, we need to ensure that the chosen vertices form as many non-intersecting diagonals as possible.
   - The number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from \( x \) vertices in a polygon is \( x - 2 \).

3. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( T \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads the \( x \) chosen vertices and sorts them.
   - The program counts the number of pairs of consecutive chosen vertices that are adjacent (i.e., the difference between them is 1).
   - It also checks the difference between the last and the first vertex to account for the circular nature of the polygon.
   - Finally, it prints the count of adjacent pairs plus \( x - 2 \).

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The program correctly sorts the chosen vertices.
   - It counts the number of adjacent pairs of chosen vertices.
   - The formula \( x - 2 \) is used to calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using \( x \) vertices.
   - The program adds the count of adjacent pairs to \( x - 2 \) to account for additional triangles that can be formed by connecting adjacent vertices.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the circular nature of the polygon by checking the difference between the last and the first vertex.
   - The program correctly handles the constraint \( y = 0 \), meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - For the first test case (8, 4, 0) with vertices [1, 6, 2, 5], the program correctly identifies 2 adjacent pairs (1, 2) and (5, 6) and prints \( 2 + 4 - 2 = 4 \). However, the expected output is 2, which suggests a potential issue.
   - For the second test case (8, 8, 0) with vertices [1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8], the program correctly identifies 8 adjacent pairs and prints \( 8 + 8 - 2 = 14 \). However, the expected output is 6, which suggests a potential issue.
   - For the third test case (4, 2, 0) with vertices [1, 3], the program correctly identifies 1 adjacent pair and prints \( 1 + 2 - 2 = 1 \). However, the expected output is 2, which suggests a potential issue.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for counting adjacent pairs and adding \( x - 2 \) is incorrect. The correct approach should be to directly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles using the formula \( x - 2 \) without considering adjacent pairs.

### Correctness:
**False**
