Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list and its first element is no longer 0, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0**

The first element of the list `a` has been removed, so the list is now one element shorter. The first element of `a` is no longer 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `res` remain unchanged.
