Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(res)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The list `a` has all leading and trailing zeros removed, meaning it only contains the non-zero elements and any zeros that are not at the beginning or end of the list.
   - `res` is defined as the number of zeros in the list `a`.
   - Since `a` has all leading and trailing zeros removed, the only zeros that remain in `a` are those that are internal to the list.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the number of zeros that are internal to the list `a`.

Output: **res (where res is the number of zeros in the list `a` after removing all leading and trailing zeros)**
