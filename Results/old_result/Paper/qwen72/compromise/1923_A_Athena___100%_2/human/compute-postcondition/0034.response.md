The code snippet `res = 0` reassigns the variable `res` to 0. This overrides the previous value of `res`, which was the number of zeros in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `res` is 0.**
