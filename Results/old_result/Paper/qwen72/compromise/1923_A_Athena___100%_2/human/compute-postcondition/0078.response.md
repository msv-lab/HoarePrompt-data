Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1` (or `i` is -1 if `a` becomes empty), `res` is 0, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already completed, `n` is an input integer.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `a` will have all trailing zeros removed. The variable `i` will be the index of the last element in the modified list `a` (or -1 if `a` is empty). The variable `res` remains 0, `t` is still greater than the number of iterations that have completed, and `n` remains the input integer.
