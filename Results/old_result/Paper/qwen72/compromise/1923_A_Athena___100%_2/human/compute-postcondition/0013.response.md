The code `a.pop()` removes the last element from the list `a`. Since the last element of `a` is 0, after executing this code, the last element will be removed, and the new last element will be the one that was second to last in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a non-empty list with all leading zeros removed and its last element is now the second-to-last element from the initial state, `res` is 0**
