The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but it is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells in the ribbon, and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers (0 or 1) where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell with a chip. The input is provided in a structured format where the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by `t` test cases, each with two lines: the first line of each test case contains the integer `n`, and the second line contains the list `a`. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. Each result indicates whether it is possible to move all the chips to a single cell by following certain rules, or if it is not possible.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of length `n` containing integers (0 or 1). It returns a list of results, where each result indicates whether it is possible to move all the chips to a single cell.**
