For the loop to execute, the state of the objects in the loop head (`test_case` and `test_cases`) must be such that `test_cases` is not empty. The variable `t` and the list `results` are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and n is even) and two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, `test_cases` must have at least one tuple, and `test_case` should be the first tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `test_case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
