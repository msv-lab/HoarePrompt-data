Reasoning:

The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations of two types:
1. Assign a permutation to a row.
2. Assign a permutation to a column.

The maximum possible sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling the entire matrix with the maximum possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \). The sum of a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is given by the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \). Since the matrix is \( n \times n \), the maximum sum of all elements in the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

The program provided attempts to calculate this sum and print the operations. However, there are a few issues with the logic and the output format:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum in a loop, which is unnecessary. The sum should be directly calculated as \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The loop logic is incorrect and does not correctly compute the maximum sum.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The number of operations \( m \) should be \( 2n \) to ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum values.
   - The operations should be printed in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) in both rows and columns.

3. **Operation Logic**:
   - The program prints operations in a loop, but the logic for determining the type of operation (row or column) and the index is incorrect. It should print \( n \) row operations and \( n \) column operations, each using the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
