Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `j` is 3.
2. `t` is greater than 0.
3. `_` is 1.
4. `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
5. `i` is `n`.
6. `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
7. `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: This is a new input integer greater than 0. Let's denote this input value as `n`.
2. **Function `range(1, n + 1)`**: This function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
3. **Print Statement**: The `print` statement with the `*` operator unpacks the sequence generated by `range(1, n + 1)` and prints each element separated by a space.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n` is 5, then `range(1, 5 + 1)` will generate the sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
- The `print` statement will unpack this sequence and print: `1 2 3 4 5`.

### General Output:
Since `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, the output will be a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

### Final Output:
Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
