Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
- `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the code snippet, so we can ignore it).
- `n` is the input integer.
- `i` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The `sum` is calculated as the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - Since `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the formula for the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, and `i * n` is simply `i` times `n`, we need to determine which one is used in the sum.
   - The problem states that `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. This is a bit ambiguous, but typically, the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is used in such contexts.
   - Therefore, `sum` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

2. **Value of `r`:**
   - `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - Let's analyze the condition:
     - `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers.
     - `i * n` is `i` times `n`.
     - We need to find the largest `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - Simplifying the condition:
     - `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`
     - Dividing both sides by `n` (since `n > 0`):
     - `(n + 1) // 2 > i`
   - The largest integer `i` that satisfies this condition is `i = (n + 1) // 2 - 1`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - `sum` is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
   - `r` is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
   - The print statement is `print(sum, n + r)`.

### Output:
- `sum` is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition, which is `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`.
- Therefore, `n + r` is `n + ((n + 1) // 2 - 1)`.

Combining these, the output will be:
Output: **n * (n + 1) // 2, n + ((n + 1) // 2 - 1)**

To make it more human-readable:
Output: **sum of the first n natural numbers, n + (the last value of i that satisfies the condition)**

For example, if `n = 5`:
- `sum` is `5 * (5 + 1) // 2 = 15`.
- `r` is `(5 + 1) // 2 - 1 = 2`.
- `n + r` is `5 + 2 = 7`.

So, the output for `n = 5` would be:
Output: **15, 7**
