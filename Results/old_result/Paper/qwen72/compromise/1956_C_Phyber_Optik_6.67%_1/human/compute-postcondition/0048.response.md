Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is 0, `r` is 0, `j` is `n + 1`, and the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `n`.** 

Explanation:
- The sum of the first `n` positive integers is given by the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`.
- The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` simplifies to `n * (n + 1) // 2 > n` because `i` is 1.
- Since `n` is greater than 0, the sum of the first `n` positive integers (`n * (n + 1) // 2`) is indeed greater than `n`, satisfying the if condition.
