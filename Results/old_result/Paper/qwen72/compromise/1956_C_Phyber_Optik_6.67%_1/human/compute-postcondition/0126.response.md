Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `r` is a non-negative integer.
- `j` is defined as `j + 1`.
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1`.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` still holds.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding `j`**:
   - The statement `j` is `j + 1` is a bit confusing. It suggests that `j` is being incremented by 1. However, in the context of the precondition, it seems to imply that `j` is already incremented by 1 before the print statement.
   - Therefore, `j` is effectively `j + 1` when the print statement is executed.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` must hold true.
   - If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` must still hold true.
   - This implies that `j` can be any value, but it will always satisfy the condition `j + 1 <= n + r + 1`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`.
   - The first value printed is `2`.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`, which is the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

### Determining `j % n`:
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j % n` will be `j - 1` because `j` is already incremented by 1.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j % n` will be the remainder of `j` divided by `n`. This value will be between 0 and `n-1`.

### Final Output:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `j % n`, which will be a value between 0 and `n-1` depending on the current value of `j`.

Output: **2, j % n (where j % n is the remainder of j divided by n, and j is the value of j after being incremented by 1)**
