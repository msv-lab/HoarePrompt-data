Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is `i * n`, `r` is 0, and `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n`**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated to `sum += i * n`. Since `sum` was initially 0, after this operation, `sum` becomes `i * n`.
- The values of `j`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2` is less than or equal to `i * n` is still valid, as the value of `i * n` has been added to `sum`, but this does not affect the condition.
