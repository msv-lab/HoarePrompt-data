Output State: **`j` is `n + r + 1`, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `j` has been incremented to `n + r + 1`, which is the value that causes the loop to terminate.
- The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, `r`, and `sum` remain unchanged from their initial values. Specifically:
  - `t` is still greater than 0.
  - `_` is still 1.
  - `n` is still the input integer greater than 0.
  - `i` is still `n`.
  - `r` is still the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
  - `sum` is still the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
