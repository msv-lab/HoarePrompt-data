Let's analyze the given state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `j` is incremented to 2.
- The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is 2.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

### Print Statement:
```python
print(2, j % n, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Value of `2`**: This is a constant value, so it will print `2`.
2. **Value of `j % n`**:
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
   - The value of `j % n` is `2 % n`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, the possible values of `2 % n` are:
     - If `n` is 1, `2 % 1` is 0.
     - If `n` is 2, `2 % 2` is 0.
     - If `n` is greater than 2, `2 % n` is 2.

### Conclusion:
- The first value printed is `2`.
- The second value printed is `2 % n`, which can be 0 if `n` is 1 or 2, and 2 if `n` is greater than 2.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

### Final Output:
Output: **2, 2 % n (where 2 % n is 0 if n is 1 or 2, and 2 if n is greater than 2)**
