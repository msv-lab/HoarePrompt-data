Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `r` is a non-negative integer.
   - `j` is defined as `j + 1`.
   - The condition `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` is true.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `r` is a non-negative integer (i.e., `r >= 0`).
   - `j` is defined as `j + 1`, which means `j` is incremented by 1 before the print statement is executed.
   - The condition `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` ensures that `j` is within a valid range after being incremented.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement `print(1, j, end=' ')` will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, and the `end=' '` argument ensures that the output ends with a space instead of a newline.

4. **Determining the Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` is defined as `j + 1`, it means that `j` is incremented by 1 before the print statement.
   - The exact initial value of `j` is not provided, but we know that after the increment, `j` will be a value such that `j + 1 <= n + r + 1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The print statement will output `1` followed by the value of `j` after it has been incremented by 1.
   - The value of `j` after incrementing is `j + 1`, and it will be printed as such.

Output: **1, j + 1 (where j + 1 is the value of j after being incremented by 1 and j + 1 <= n + r + 1)**
