Let's break down the initial state and the print statement to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
- `_` is 1 (though `_` is not used in the print statement).
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is 1.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
- Additionally, `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

### Print Statement:
```
print(1, j, end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The print statement will print the integer `1`, followed by the value of `j`, and then a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Values of Variables:
- `1` is a constant integer.
- `j` is explicitly stated to be 1 in the initial state.

### Output:
The print statement will output the integer `1` followed by the value of `j` (which is 1) and a space.

Output: **1 1**
