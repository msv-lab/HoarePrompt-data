The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `i` retain their initial values.
- If `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, then `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2` and `r` is set to 1.
- Otherwise, `sum` is updated to `i * n` and `r` remains 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration, the new state is:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` for the loop to continue.

State: **`j`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `i` retain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**
