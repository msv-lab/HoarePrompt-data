Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0 (though `t` is not used in the code snippet).
- `_` is 0 (though `_` is not used in the code snippet).
- `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n` (though `sum` is not used in the code snippet).
- `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
- `n + r` must be at least 1 (though this condition is always true since `n` is greater than 0 and `r` is at least 0).
- `j` is greater than `n` (though `j` is not used in the code snippet).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers starting from 1 up to and including `n`.
- The `*` operator unpacks the sequence, so the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Output:
- The `print` statement will print the integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer and must be greater than 0)**
