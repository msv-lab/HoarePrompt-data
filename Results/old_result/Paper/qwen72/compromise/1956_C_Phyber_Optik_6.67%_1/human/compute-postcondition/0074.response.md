To determine the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `j` is the loop variable.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

3. **Determine the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + r + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `2` must be less than `n + r + 1`.

4. **Adjust the State:**
   - `j` is incremented to 2.
   - The condition `j <= n + r` must still hold true for the loop to execute again.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 1.
- `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
- `i` is `n`.
- `j` is 2.
- `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
- `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `j` is 2, `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`, and `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.**
