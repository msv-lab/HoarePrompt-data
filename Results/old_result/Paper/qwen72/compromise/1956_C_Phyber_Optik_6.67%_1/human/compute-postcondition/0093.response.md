Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `n` is a new input integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`, `r` is 1, and the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `n`.**

Explanation:
- `sum` is updated to `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`, where `n * (n + 1) // 2` is the sum of the first `n` positive integers.
- The values of `j`, `t`, `_`, `n`, `i`, and `r` remain unchanged.
- The condition that the sum of the first `n` positive integers is greater than `n` still holds true.
