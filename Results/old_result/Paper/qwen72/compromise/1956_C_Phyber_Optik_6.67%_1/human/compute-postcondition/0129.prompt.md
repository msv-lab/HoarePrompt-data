Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `j`, `t`, `_`, `n` retain their initial values. `i` is `n + 1`, `sum` is the sum of `i * n` for all `i` from 1 to `n` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`, plus the sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` from 1 to `n` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or remains 0 if no such `i` exists.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
    if j <= n:
        print(1, j, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))
    else:
        print(2, j % n, end=' ')
        print(*range(1, n + 1))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the condition `j <= n` holds true. If `j` is greater than `n`, the condition `j > n` holds true.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, and `j` is `j + 1`. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1`. If `j` is greater than `n`, then `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` still holds.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `r` is a non-negative integer, and `j` is incremented by 1. Regardless of whether `j` is less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, the condition `j + 1 <= n + r + 1` holds.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
