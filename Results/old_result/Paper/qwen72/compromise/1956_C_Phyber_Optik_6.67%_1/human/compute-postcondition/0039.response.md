Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `_` is 0.
3. `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
4. `i` is `n`.
5. `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
6. `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
7. `n + r` must be at least 2.
8. `j` is `n + 2`.
9. If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, the program maintains the same state. Otherwise, the program also maintains the same state.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

### Analysis:
- The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- The `*` operator unpacks the sequence, so the `print` function will print each integer in the sequence separated by spaces.

### Variables and Objects:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0.
- The `range(1, n + 1)` will generate a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print the sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is the input integer greater than 0)**
