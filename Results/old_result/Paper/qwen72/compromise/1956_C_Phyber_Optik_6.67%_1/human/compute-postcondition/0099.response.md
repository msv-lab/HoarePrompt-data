Output State: **`j`, `t`, `_`, `n` retain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `r` is equal to `i + 1`, `sum` is `sum + n * (n + 1) // 2`**

Explanation:
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding the result of the expression `n * (n + 1) // 2` to its current value.
- The values of `j`, `t`, `_`, and `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `i` is still `i + 1`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1` remains valid.
- The value of `r` remains `i + 1`.
