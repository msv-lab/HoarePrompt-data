Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `sum` is the sum of all values of `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` or 0 if no such `i` exists.
   - `n + r` must be at least 1.
   - `j` is `n + 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(1, j, end=' ')
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value `1` is a constant integer.
   - The value `j` is defined as `n + 1`. Since `n` is an input integer and must be greater than 0, `j` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the values `1` and `j`, separated by a space, and will not end the line (due to `end=' '`).

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **1 [n + 1] (where n is the input integer and must be greater than 0)**
