Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `_` is 1.
   - `n` is a new input integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - `j` is greater than `n`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `t` is not used in the print statement.
   - `_` is not used in the print statement.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is set to `n`.
   - `j` is initially 1, but it is later stated that `j` is greater than `n`.

3. **Calculating `r`:**
   - `r` is the largest integer `i` such that `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - This can be simplified to finding the largest `i` such that \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > in\).
   - Dividing both sides by `n` gives \(\frac{n + 1}{2} > i\).
   - Therefore, `r` is the largest integer less than \(\frac{n + 1}{2}\), which is \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + 1}{2} \right\rfloor - 1\).

4. **Calculating `sum`:**
   - `sum` is the total sum of `n * (n + 1) // 2` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` plus the total sum of `i * n` for all `i` where `n * (n + 1) // 2 <= i * n`.
   - For `i` where \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} > in\), the sum is \(\sum_{i=1}^{r} \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\).
   - For `i` where \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \leq in\), the sum is \(\sum_{i=r+1}^{n} in\).

5. **Final State:**
   - `j` is greater than `n`.

6. **Print Statement:**
   - `print(2, j % n, end=' ')`
   - The first value printed is 2.
   - The second value printed is `j % n`.
   - Since `j` is greater than `n`, `j % n` will be the remainder when `j` is divided by `n`.

Given that `j` is greater than `n`, the remainder `j % n` can be any integer from 1 to `n-1` depending on the value of `j`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, [j % n] (where j % n is the remainder when j is divided by n, and j is greater than n)**
