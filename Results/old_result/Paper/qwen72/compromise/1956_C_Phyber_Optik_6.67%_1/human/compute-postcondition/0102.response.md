The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to the new value of `i`.

State: **`j`, `t`, `_`, `n` retain their initial values, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i + 1`**
