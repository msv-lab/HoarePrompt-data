Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and a is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, the array a is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    tmp = a[0]
    cnt = 0
    ans = n
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] == tmp:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
            cnt = 0
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if n == 1 or ans == n:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the number of times the integer `tmp` appears consecutively at the end of the list `a`, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive appearances of `tmp` found in the list `a` before the last sequence, and `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `ans` and `cnt`. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` in the last segment of the list `a`, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in any segment of the list `a` including the last segment. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
