Output State: **`t` is 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution, updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `cnt`. If `n` is equal to 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the output is `-1`. Otherwise, the output is `ans`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all `t` iterations, the variable `t` is reduced to 0 because the loop has completed all its iterations. The placeholder `_` is used to iterate through the range of `t` and does not affect the state. The variables `n` and `a` remain as they were input by the user for each iteration. The variable `tmp` is set to the first element of the list `a` for each iteration. The variable `cnt` holds the count of consecutive elements in `a` that are equal to `tmp` at the end of the list. The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in the list `a` during the loop execution, including the last segment. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, the output for that iteration is `-1`. Otherwise, the output for that iteration is `ans`. This process is repeated for each of the `t` test cases.
