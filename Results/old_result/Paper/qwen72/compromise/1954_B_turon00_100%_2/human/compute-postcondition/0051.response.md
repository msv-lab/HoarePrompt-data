The value of `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain as they were in the initial state. The condition that `n` must be greater than the new value of `i` is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is updated to the minimum of its current value and `cnt`.**
