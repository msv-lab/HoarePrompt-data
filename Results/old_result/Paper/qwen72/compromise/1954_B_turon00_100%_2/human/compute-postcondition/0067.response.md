To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head, which in this case are `i` and `n`.

1. **Variable `n`**: The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not run at all.
2. **Variable `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0 and incrementing by 1 until it reaches `n-1`. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `i` before the loop starts.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `cnt` is 0.
- `ans` is `n`.
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`.

We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The initial value of `i` is `n-1`, but this is not relevant to the loop head, as `i` will be reinitialized by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`**
