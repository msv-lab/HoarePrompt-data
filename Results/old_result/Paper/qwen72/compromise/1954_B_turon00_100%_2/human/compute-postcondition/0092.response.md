The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The list `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Given these parameters, the function is expected to return some output based on the input, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. However, we can infer that the function processes the list `a` and returns a result for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list `a`), and `a` (a list of integers). It processes the list `a` for each test case and returns a result based on the input.**
