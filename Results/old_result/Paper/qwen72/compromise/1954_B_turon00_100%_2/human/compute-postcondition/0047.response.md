Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`, `ans` is updated to the minimum value between the current `ans` and `cnt`, `cnt` is 0.**

The code snippet sets `cnt` to 0. The values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` are not directly modified by this code, but the conditions related to these variables remain the same. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions along with the updated value of `cnt`.
