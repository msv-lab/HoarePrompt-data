The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is unknown. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `tmp`) remain unchanged. Since `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, these conditions still hold true.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `tmp` is the first element of the list `a`, `cnt` is increased by 1.**
