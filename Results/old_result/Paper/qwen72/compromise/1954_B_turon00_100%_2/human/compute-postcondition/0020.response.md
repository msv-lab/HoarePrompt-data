Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `tmp` is equal to the first integer in the list `a`, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 1, `ans` is 0 or `n` depending on the initial conditions.**

Explanation: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1. If `a[i-1]` (which is `a[1]` since `i` is 2) was equal to `tmp`, `cnt` was initially 2 and is now 3. If `a[i-1]` was not equal to `tmp`, `cnt` was initially 0 and is now 1. The value of `ans` remains unchanged and is either 0 or `n` depending on the initial conditions. All other variables remain in their initial states.
