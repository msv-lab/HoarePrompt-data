Postcondition: ***`i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` in the last segment of the list `a`, and `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to `tmp` found in any segment of the list `a` including the last segment. If `n` is 1 or `ans` is equal to `n`, no further changes are made. Otherwise, `n` is not equal to 1 and `ans` is not equal to `n`.***
