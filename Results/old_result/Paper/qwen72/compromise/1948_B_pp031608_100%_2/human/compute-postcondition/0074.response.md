The code snippet `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` performs the following actions:

1. It takes the element at index `i - 1` from the list `arr` and converts it to a string.
2. It then iterates over each character in this string, converting each character back to an integer, and creates a list of these integers.
3. Finally, it appends the element at index `i` from the list `arr` to this list of integers.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `_` is a placeholder
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is True

Let's calculate the output state:

1. `arr[i - 1]` is `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the list `arr`.
2. `str(arr[0])` converts this integer to a string.
3. `[int(i) for i in str(arr[0])]` converts each character of this string back to an integer and creates a list of these integers.
4. `arr[i]` is `arr[1]`, which is the second element of the list `arr`.
5. The final list `nums` is the concatenation of the list of integers from step 3 and the single integer from step 4.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50
- `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2
- `_` is a placeholder
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `i` is 1
- `ans` is True
- `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is True, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**
