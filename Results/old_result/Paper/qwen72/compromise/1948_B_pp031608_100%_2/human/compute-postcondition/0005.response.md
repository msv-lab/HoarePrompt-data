To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions specified in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
```

This loop will iterate over the range starting from `m - 1` down to `1` (inclusive), decrementing by 1 each time. For the loop to execute at least once, the following conditions must be met:

1. `m - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1.
2. This implies that `m` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3
- `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `m` is an input integer
- `_` is a placeholder
- `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input
- `ans` is True

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `m` is greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `ans` is True, `i` is `m - 1`**
