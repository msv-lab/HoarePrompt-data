Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and the `nums` list remained sorted throughout all iterations. If at any point `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and `nums` is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the loop terminates early. Otherwise, `ans` remains True after all iterations.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains within its initial bounds (1 to 10^3).
- The variable `n` remains within its initial bounds (1 to 50).
- The variable `m` remains an input integer greater than or equal to 2.
- The placeholder `_` remains unchanged.
- The list `arr` is modified based on the conditions inside the loop.
- The variable `i` is decremented from `m - 1` down to 1.
- The variable `ans` is either True or False. It starts as True and remains True if the conditions inside the loop do not cause it to be set to False. If at any iteration, `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` and the resulting `nums` list is not sorted, `ans` is set to False and the loop terminates early. If the loop completes without setting `ans` to False, `ans` remains True.
