The code snippet reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers, which is then assigned to the variable `arr`. This impacts the value of `arr`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is either True or False depending on whether the condition inside the loop was met and the `nums` list remained sorted throughout all iterations.**
