Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, `ans` is False, `nums` is a list containing the digits of `arr[0]` followed by `arr[1]`.**

Explanation:
- The variable `ans` was initially set to `True` but is now set to `False`.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `arr`, `i`, `nums`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
