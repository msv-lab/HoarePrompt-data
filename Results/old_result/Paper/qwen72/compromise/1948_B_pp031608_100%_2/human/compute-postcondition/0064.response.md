To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Head Variables**: The variables in the loop head are `i`, `m`.
2. **Range Function**: The `range(m - 1, 0, -1)` function generates a sequence starting from `m - 1` down to 1 (inclusive) with a step of -1.
3. **Condition for Execution**: For the loop to execute at least once, the starting value (`m - 1`) must be greater than or equal to the stopping value (1). This means `m - 1` must be at least 1, so `m` must be at least 2.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`m`**: Since `m` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, this condition is already satisfied by the given state (`m` is an input integer such that `m >= 2`).
- **`i`**: The variable `i` will be set by the `range` function, starting from `m - 1` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches 1. Therefore, `i` does not need to be adjusted manually.

### Final State:
Given that the conditions for `m` are already met and `i` will be set by the loop, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True**.
