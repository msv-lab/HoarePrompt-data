Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n-1 <= 50, `m` is an input integer such that m >= 2, `_` is a placeholder, `arr` is a list of integers derived from the input, `i` is 1, and `ans` is True.**

Explanation: The code snippet sets the variable `ans` to `True`. This changes the value of `ans` from its initial state (which could be either `True` or `False`) to `True`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `_`, `arr`, and `i`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
