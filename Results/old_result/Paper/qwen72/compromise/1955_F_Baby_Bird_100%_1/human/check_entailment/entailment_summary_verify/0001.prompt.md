You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200). The function reads the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10,000) from user input and then, for each test case, reads four integers from user input. It computes a value based on these integers and prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the computed results have been printed to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers, each between 1 and 4.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve removes one number at a time, and the goal is to maximize the number of times Bob wins.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.

3. **XOR of Numbers 1 to 4:**
   - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
   - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 1 \)

4. **Optimal Strategy for Eve:**
   - Eve should remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.
   - To achieve this, Eve can pair numbers that XOR to zero and remove them in pairs. If there is an odd number of a certain type, she can leave one unpaired to ensure the XOR is non-zero.

5. **Counting Pairs:**
   - For each type of number (1, 2, 3, 4), Eve can remove pairs of the same number.
   - The number of pairs for each type is \( \text{count} // 2 \).
   - If there is an odd count, she can leave one unpaired.

6. **Combining Pairs:**
   - The total number of pairs that can be removed is the sum of pairs for each type.
   - Each pair removal results in a win for Bob.
   - The formula used in the program is \( \text{sum}(3 * (x // 2) + x \% 2 * (i < 3)) // 3 \).

7. **Explanation of the Formula:**
   - \( 3 * (x // 2) \) counts the number of pairs that can be removed for each type.
   - \( x \% 2 * (i < 3) \) ensures that if there is an odd count, it is considered only for the first three types (1, 2, 3).
   - The division by 3 at the end is to account for the fact that each pair removal results in a win for Bob.

8. **Verification:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input into four integers representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - It calculates the number of pairs and the potential unpaired numbers and sums them up.
   - The result is divided by 3 to get the maximum number of wins for Bob.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. The formula and the approach are consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
