The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates on a set of inputs that include an integer `t` and four integers `p_i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to 4). The constraints indicate that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10,000, and each `p_i` is an integer within the range 0 to 200. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it is expected to return some result based on these inputs.

Since the function definition does not include parameters, we can infer that the inputs are likely provided through some external means, such as global variables or input from a user or file. The function's primary task is to process these inputs and return a result based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10,000) and four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200) and returns a result based on these inputs.**
