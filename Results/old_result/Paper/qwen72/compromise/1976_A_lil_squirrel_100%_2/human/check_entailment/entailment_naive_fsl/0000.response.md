Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description:

1. **Password Composition**: The program checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits by using the `isdigit()` and `isalpha()` methods.
2. **No Digit After a Letter**: The program ensures that there is no digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking if a letter is followed by a digit.
3. **Sorted Digits**: The program checks if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `digits` list with its sorted version.
4. **Sorted Letters**: The program checks if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the `letters` list with its sorted version.

The program handles all edge cases, including:
- Passwords with only letters.
- Passwords with only digits.
- Passwords with both letters and digits.
- Passwords of different lengths (1 to 20 characters).

Since the program meets all the requirements and handles all potential cases, it is correct.
