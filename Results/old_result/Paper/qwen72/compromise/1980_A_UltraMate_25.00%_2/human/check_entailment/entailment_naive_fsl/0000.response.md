Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the difficulty level 'G' is required. The string `p` used in the program only includes difficulties 'A' to 'F', but the problem description specifies that each round requires problems of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. Therefore, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of additional problems needed if 'G' is missing or insufficient in the input string. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10 1
BGECDCBDED
```
The program will output `2`, which is correct because it identifies that 'A' and 'F' are missing. However, if the input is:
```
1
10 1
ABCDEFABC
```
The program will output `0`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the missing 'G'. The correct output should be `1`.
