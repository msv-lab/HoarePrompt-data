The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. At the start of the next iteration, `_` is incremented by 1, so `_` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is -1. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` is a set containing `{x}`.**
