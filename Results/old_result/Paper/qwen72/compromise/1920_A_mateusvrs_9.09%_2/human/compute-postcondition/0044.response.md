The value of `tmp` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `tmp` is not specified, but it is known that if `i` is between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive), `tmp` was initially 1; otherwise, it was 0. After the increment, if `i` was between `bx` and `ax`, `tmp` becomes 2; otherwise, `tmp` becomes 1. All other conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` must contain at least one element, `i` is the next element in `cx`, `bx` is less than `ax`, if `i` is greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, then `tmp` is 2, otherwise `tmp` is 1.**
