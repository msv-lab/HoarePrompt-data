Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer input by the user, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution. No two constraints are the same within a test case. `r` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    cx = set()
    ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
    bx = -1
    for _ in range(n):
        a, x = map(int, input().split())
        if a == 1:
            bx = max(x, bx)
        elif a == 2:
            ax = min(x, ax)
        else:
            cx.add(x)
    if bx >= ax:
        r.append(0)
    else:
        tmp = 0
        for i in cx:
            if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                tmp += 1
        r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, and `cx` contains all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` now includes an additional element `0`. Otherwise, if `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` contains one additional element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *After all iterations, `n` is 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` contains all unique `x` values encountered where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, the list `r` includes the value 0. If `bx` is less than `ax`, `i` is the last element in `cx`, `tmp` is the number of elements in `cx` that satisfy the condition `bx <= i <= ax` if `i` is within the range, otherwise it is the count of such elements up to the last iteration, and `r` is a list containing the value `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *_ is n-1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` now contains an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range [bx, ax], and `r` is the list with the new element (ax - bx + 1 - tmp) appended.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
