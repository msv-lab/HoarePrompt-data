Postcondition: ***`_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007, and `bx` is -1. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value between `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` is a set containing `{x}`.***
