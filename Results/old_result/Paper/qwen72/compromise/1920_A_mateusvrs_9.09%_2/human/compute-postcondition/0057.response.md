To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`.

1. **Variable `_`:** This is a placeholder variable used in the loop, and its initial value is set to `n`. However, this value is not used within the loop head itself and is typically discarded after each iteration.

2. **Variable `n`:** This variable controls the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the only necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The value of `_` is not relevant to the loop's execution condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The other variables (`t`, `ax`, `bx`, `cx`, `r`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
