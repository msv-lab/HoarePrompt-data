The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the given parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts a set of test cases, each containing a number of constraints. Specifically:

- The function accepts an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints.
- Each constraint is represented by a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and `x` is an integer where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
- There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, ensuring a finite solution.
- No two constraints are the same within a test case.

The function processes these constraints and returns a result based on the constraints provided for each test case. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the problem statement, but it is implied that the function will return a solution or a set of solutions for each test case based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a set of test cases, each containing a number of constraints represented by pairs (a, x). It processes these constraints and returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided.**
