The value of `ax` is updated to be the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. Let's analyze the different cases based on the initial conditions:

1. If `a` is not 2, `ax` is initially 1000000007. After executing `ax = min(x, ax)`, `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
2. If `a` is 2, `ax` is initially the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. After executing `ax = min(x, ax)`, `ax` will remain the same because it is already the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.

Therefore, the value of `ax` will be the minimum of `x` and 1000000007 regardless of whether `a` is 2 or not.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `a`, `x`, `bx`, `cx`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, `bx` is -1 if `a` is not 1, otherwise `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1, `cx` is an empty set if `a` is 1 or 2, otherwise `cx` contains `x`.**
