Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is `n-1`, `n` is greater than 0, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, and `cx` contains all `x` values where `a` is neither 1 nor 2. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` now includes an additional element `0`. Otherwise, if `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` contains one additional element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.***
