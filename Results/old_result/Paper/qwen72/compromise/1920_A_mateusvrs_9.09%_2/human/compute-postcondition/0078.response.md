The value of `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and the current value of `ax`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged. Since `n` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, its new value is `n - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1, now `n - 1`), `a` is an integer provided by user input, `x` is an integer provided by user input, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and the original value of `ax`.**
