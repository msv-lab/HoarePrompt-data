The code snippet `cx = set()` reinitializes `cx` as an empty set. This means that any previous contents of `cx` are cleared. The values of other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `ax`, `bx`, `r`, and `tmp`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 (decremented by 1), `_` is `n`, `n` is an input integer, `ax` is the minimum of all `x` values where `a` is 2, `bx` is the maximum of all `x` values where `a` is 1, `cx` is an empty set, if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` now includes an additional element `0`. Otherwise, if `bx` is less than `ax`, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that are greater than or equal to `bx` and less than or equal to `ax`, and `r` contains one additional element which is `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.**
