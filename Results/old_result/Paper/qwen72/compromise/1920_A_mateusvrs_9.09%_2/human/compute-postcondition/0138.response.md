Postcondition: **`_` is n-1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing at least one unique `x` value where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1, `tmp` is 0 if the current value of `i` is outside the range [bx, ax]. If the current value of `i` is within the range [bx, ax], `tmp` is set to 1. If no `a` was 1, `bx` remains -1, and if no `a` was 2, `ax` remains 1000000007, with `bx` always being less than `ax`.**
