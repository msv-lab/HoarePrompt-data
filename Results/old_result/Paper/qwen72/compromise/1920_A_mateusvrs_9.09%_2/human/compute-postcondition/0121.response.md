Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `bx` is -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007, and `cx` remains an empty set. Otherwise, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `ax` is 1000000007.***
