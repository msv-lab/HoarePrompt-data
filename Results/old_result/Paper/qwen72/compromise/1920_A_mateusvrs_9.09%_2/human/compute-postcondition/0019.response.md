The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` will increment by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `ax` is 1000000007, `bx` is -1, and `cx` is an empty set. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum of `x` and -1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` contains `x`.**
