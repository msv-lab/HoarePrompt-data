The code snippet `a, x = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input and assigns them to the variables `a` and `x`. This changes the values of `a` and `x` from their initial state (which was unspecified) to the values provided by the user.

Given the initial state:
- `_` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 2
- `t` is greater than 0
- `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input
- `cx` is an empty set
- `ax` is 1000000007
- If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1)
- If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1 and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007
- For any other value of `a`, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `ax` is 1000000007

After executing the code snippet, the values of `a` and `x` are updated to the values provided by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 1, `bx` is max(x, -1). If `a` is 2, `bx` is -1 and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. For any other value of `a`, `bx` is -1, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `ax` is 1000000007.**
