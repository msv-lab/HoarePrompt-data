Postcondition: **After all iterations, `n` is 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input. If `a` is 1, `bx` is the maximum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 1. If `a` is 2, `ax` is the minimum value encountered among all `x` values where `a` was 2. If `a` is neither 1 nor 2, `cx` contains all unique `x` values encountered where `a` was neither 1 nor 2. Additionally, `bx` is less than `ax`.**
