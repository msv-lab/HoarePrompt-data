Postcondition: ***_ is n-1, `n` is the input integer, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is a set containing all unique `x` values where `a` was neither 1 nor 2, `ax` is the minimum value of all `x` values where `a` was 2, `bx` is the maximum value of all `x` values where `a` was 1. If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, `r` now contains an additional element `0` at the end. Otherwise, `tmp` is the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range [bx, ax], and `r` is the list with the new element (ax - bx + 1 - tmp) appended.***
