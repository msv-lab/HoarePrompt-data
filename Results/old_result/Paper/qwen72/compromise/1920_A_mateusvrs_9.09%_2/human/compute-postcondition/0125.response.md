The value of `bx` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and the current value of `bx`. We need to consider the different cases for the value of `a`:

- If `a` is 1, `bx` was initially set to `max(x, -1)`.
- If `a` is 2, `bx` was initially set to -1, and `ax` was set to the minimum of `x` and 1000000007.
- For any other value of `a`, `bx` was initially set to -1, `cx` was set to a set containing the integer `x`, and `ax` was set to 1000000007.

In all cases, the new value of `bx` will be the maximum of `x` and the initial value of `bx`.

Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `t` is greater than 0, `a` and `x` are integers provided by user input, `cx` is an empty set, `ax` is 1000000007. If `a` is 1, `bx` is `max(x, max(x, -1))`. If `a` is 2, `bx` is `max(x, -1)` and `ax` is the minimum of `x` and 1000000007. For any other value of `a`, `bx` is `max(x, -1)`, `cx` is a set containing the integer `x`, and `ax` is 1000000007.**
