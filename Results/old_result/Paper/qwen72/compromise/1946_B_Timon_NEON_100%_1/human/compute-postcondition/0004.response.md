The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function, and it will iterate over the indices of `arr`.

To ensure the loop executes, `arr` must have at least one element. The state of `i` is automatically managed by the `range` function, so it does not need to be explicitly stated.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers such that -10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(arr), and `arr` must have at least one element, `new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is [0, 0], `segments_variants` is an empty list, `max_sum` is -1**
