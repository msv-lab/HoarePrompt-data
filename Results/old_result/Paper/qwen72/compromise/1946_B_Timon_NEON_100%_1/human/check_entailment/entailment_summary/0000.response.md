### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to find the maximum possible sum of an array after performing exactly `k` operations, where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray and inserting its sum anywhere in the array.
   - The key insight is that the maximum sum can be achieved by repeatedly selecting the subarray with the maximum sum and inserting its sum. This is because the sum of the array will increase by the maximum subarray sum in each operation.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1:** This function takes an integer `number` and returns the result of `number % 1000000007`. This is used to ensure that the final answer is within the required modulo.
   - **func_2:** This function is intended to find the maximum segment of non-negative numbers in the array `arr`. However, the function's implementation is flawed:
     - The function initializes `max_segment` and `new_segment` with a single element, which is not a valid representation of a segment.
     - The function does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers.
     - The function incorrectly appends segments to `segments_variants` even when `new_segment` is empty.
     - The function does not correctly compute the maximum segment sum.
   - **func_3:** This function is not used in the given program and does not contribute to the solution. It simply returns a list of `quantity` elements, each being `number`.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the maximum segment sum.
   - If the maximum segment sum is `-1` (indicating no non-negative numbers), it sets the maximum segment sum to `0`.
   - It computes the final answer using the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`, which is intended to account for the repeated addition of the maximum segment sum.
   - Finally, it prints the result of `func_1(answer)`.

4. **Issues:**
   - **func_2:** The function `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum segment sum. It should use a more robust algorithm, such as Kadane's algorithm, to find the maximum subarray sum.
   - **Handling Negative Arrays:** The program assumes that if the array contains only negative numbers, the maximum segment sum is `0`. This is incorrect because the maximum segment sum in a negative array is the largest single negative number, not `0`.
   - **Formula for Final Answer:** The formula used to compute the final answer is not entirely correct. The correct formula should be `max_segment_sum * (2 ** k - 1) + sum(a)`, where `max_segment_sum` is the maximum subarray sum.

### Conclusion:
The program is **incorrect** because `func_2` does not correctly find the maximum segment sum, and the formula used to compute the final answer is flawed. The program needs to be revised to use a correct algorithm for finding the maximum subarray sum and to apply the correct formula for the final answer.

Correctness: **False**
