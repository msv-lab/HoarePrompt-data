Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `n` from the user, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user, where 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The function calculates a value `k` based on the conditions provided and prints `k` for each iteration. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the values from the last iteration of user input, and the variable `k` will be the result of the last calculation performed in the loop. The function does not return any value. **
