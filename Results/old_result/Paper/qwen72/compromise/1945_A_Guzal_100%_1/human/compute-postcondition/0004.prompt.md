You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = 0
        
        if b % 3 != 0 and b % 3 + c < 3:
            print(-1)
        else:
            k += a + (b + c) // 3
            if (b + c) % 3 != 0:
                k += 1
            print(k)
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated `n` times based on user input. The variable `k` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration and then calculated based on the conditions provided in the loop. The final state of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the loop will be the values from the last iteration of user input. The value of `k` will be the result of the last calculation performed in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The function's return value is not specified, so its output cannot be determined from the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
