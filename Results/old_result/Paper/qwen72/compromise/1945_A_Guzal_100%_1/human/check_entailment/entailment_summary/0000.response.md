### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The function checks if `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`. This condition ensures that if there are extroverts that cannot form a complete tent of 3 people, there must be enough universals to fill the remaining spots. If this condition is not met, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirements.

3. **Tent Calculation:**
   - If the condition is met, the function calculates the total number of tents needed.
   - `k += a` accounts for the tents needed for introverts, as each introvert requires a separate tent.
   - `(b + c) // 3` calculates the number of complete tents that can be formed with extroverts and universals.
   - If `(b + c) % 3 != 0`, it means there are some participants left over who cannot form a complete tent, so it adds 1 more tent to `k`.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `k` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- **Introverts (`a`):** Each introvert requires a separate tent, so `a` tents are needed.
- **Extroverts (`b`):** Each tent with an extrovert must have exactly 3 people. If `b` is not a multiple of 3, we need to check if there are enough universals (`c`) to fill the remaining spots. If `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form a complete tent, and the function correctly prints `-1`.
- **Universals (`c`):** Universals can be used to fill any remaining spots in tents with extroverts. The function correctly accounts for this by adding `(b + c) // 3` to `k` and checking if there are any leftover participants.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Introverts:** If there are only introverts (`a > 0, b = 0, c = 0`), the function correctly prints `a` because each introvert needs a separate tent.
- **All Extroverts:** If there are only extroverts (`a = 0, b > 0, c = 0`), the function correctly prints `-1` if `b % 3 != 0` because extroverts cannot form a complete tent without universals.
- **All Universals:** If there are only universals (`a = 0, b = 0, c > 0`), the function correctly prints `c // 3 + (c % 3 > 0)` because universals can form complete tents or a single tent with leftover participants.
- **Mixed Cases:** The function correctly handles mixed cases by ensuring that the extroverts' requirements are met first, and then using any remaining universals to form additional tents.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or outputs `-1` if it is impossible to satisfy the participants' preferences. The conditions and calculations are logically sound and handle all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
