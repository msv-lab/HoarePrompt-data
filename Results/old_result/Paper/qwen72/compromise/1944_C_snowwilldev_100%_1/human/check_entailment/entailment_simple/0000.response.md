### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `N` and the list `a` of integers.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. This is a correct approach to keep track of how many times each integer appears.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The game's score is determined by the MEX of the array `c` after all elements from `a` have been picked and removed.
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.
   - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each integer in `cnt`.
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once, it increments a counter `t`.
   - The program returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `0` or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `1`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.
   - The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` ensures that the program returns the smallest integer that is not in `c` or the second smallest integer that appears only once in `a`.
   - This approach is optimal because Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that appears only once to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that appears only once to minimize the MEX.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all integers from 0 to `N-1` are present in `a` by returning `N` as the MEX.
   - It also handles the case where some integers are missing or appear more than once correctly.
