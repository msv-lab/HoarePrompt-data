Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`. This is a correct approach to keep track of the elements in the array.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program aims to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players have played optimally. The logic in the loop is designed to find the smallest integer `i` that is either missing from the array (`cnt[i] == 0`) or appears exactly once (`cnt[i] == 1`), but only if it has been chosen by Alice and Bob in such a way that it doesn't appear in `c` more than once. The loop checks if the count of `i` is 0 or if the count of `i` is 1 and Alice and Bob have already chosen it twice. This logic is correct for finding the MEX under the optimal play conditions.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is 0 or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is 1. This is the correct approach to determine the MEX of the array `c` after the game ends.

5. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the array `a` contains only one element or when all elements are the same.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
