The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of the characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` that contains the characters of `s` rearranged in such a way that the characters are ordered by their depth in the balanced parentheses sequence, from the shallowest to the deepest. The length of `ans` is the same as `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses and returns a new string `ans` where the characters are ordered by their depth in the parentheses sequence, from the shallowest to the deepest, with the same length as `s`.**
