Correctness: **False**

The provided solution has a logical flaw in how it attempts to maximize the total difference \(D\). The approach of sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(c\) in descending order and then trying to pair elements to maximize the difference is not optimal. The correct approach should consider the largest and smallest values from the sorted \(c\) array to maximize the difference with each element of \(a\).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        c = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort both arrays
        a.sort()
        c.sort()
        
        # To maximize the difference, we should pair the smallest elements of a with the largest of c
        # and the largest elements of a with the smallest of c.
        max_diff = 0
        for i in range(n):
            # Calculate the difference with the largest remaining element in c
            diff1 = abs(a[i] - c[m - 1 - i])
            # Calculate the difference with the smallest remaining element in c
            diff2 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
            # Choose the maximum of the two differences
            max_diff += max(diff1, diff2)
        
        print(max_diff)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting**: Both arrays \(a\) and \(c\) are sorted. This allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Maximizing Differences**: For each element in \(a\), we consider two potential differences:
   - The difference with the largest remaining element in \(c\).
   - The difference with the smallest remaining element in \(c\).
3. **Choosing the Maximum Difference**: We add the maximum of these two differences to the total difference \(D\).

This approach ensures that we are always considering the best possible pairings to maximize the total difference \(D\). The original program's logic for incrementing \(i\) and \(j\) does not guarantee that the maximum differences are being considered for each element in \(a\).
