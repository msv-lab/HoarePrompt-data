The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, and it starts at 0 by default in the context of the loop.

Given the initial state, the loop will execute if the input value is greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` do not directly affect the loop head, but they are part of the overall program state. Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `m` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a_i` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b_i` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
