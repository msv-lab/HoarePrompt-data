### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel between 1 and \(10^{18}\).
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then move to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` to count the number of stalls set up, `number` to store the price per jewel for the current stall, and `tab` to store the prices of all stalls.
   - The program then enters a loop to set up the stalls:
     - It calculates `Min` as the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
     - It calculates `Max` as the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
     - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets the price per jewel to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
     - Otherwise, it sets the price per jewel to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.
     - It appends the price to `tab` and updates `n` by subtracting the total cost of the jewels bought from the current stall.
     - It increments `rep` to count the number of stalls set up.
   - The loop continues until `n` is zero, `k` is zero, `rep` reaches 60, or `n` is less than `k`.
   - If `k` is zero after the loop, it prints "YES" and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
   - The loop ensures that Bob sets up at most 60 stalls.
   - The prices are calculated to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The conditions in the loop ensure that the prices are within the valid range and that Alice's coins are sufficient to buy the required number of jewels.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by correctly printing "NO".
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero by correctly printing "YES" and the prices of the stalls.
   - The program ensures that the number of stalls set up does not exceed 60.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The output format matches the problem description: "YES" or "NO" followed by the number of stalls and the prices if the answer is "YES".

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Setup:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and initializes `rep`, `number`, and `tab`.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop condition `while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k` ensures that the program only continues if Alice has enough coins to buy at least one jewel, `k` is still greater than zero, and the number of stalls set up is less than 60.
  - The calculation of `Min` and `Max` is intended to find a price that allows Alice to buy as many jewels as possible while ensuring the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.
  - The condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k` is intended to handle the case where the maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from a stall is exactly `k` and the total cost is within her budget.
  - The `else` block sets the price to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`, which is a valid strategy to ensure Alice buys as many jewels as possible from the current stall.
  - The program appends the price to `tab` and updates `n` and `rep` accordingly.

- **Final Check:**
  - After the loop, if `k` is zero, the program prints "YES" and the prices of the stalls.
  - If `k` is not zero, the program prints "NO".

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Price Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `Min` and `Max` might not always lead to the correct prices. Specifically, the condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k` is problematic because `n * Min <= k` is always false if `Max == k` and `Min` is less than 1, which is not possible since `Min` is at least 1.
  - The `else` block should be the primary logic for setting prices, but the `if` block is redundant and can be removed.

- **Loop Termination:**
  - The loop should terminate when `k` is zero, regardless of the value of `n`. The condition `n >= k` ensures that Alice can buy at least one jewel from the current stall, but it does not guarantee that the loop will terminate correctly if `k` is zero.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        rep = 0
        tab = []
        
        while k > 0 and rep < 60:
            price = n // k
            if price == 0:
                break
            jewels_bought = min(k, n // price)
            tab.append(str(price))
            n -= price * jewels_bought
            k -= jewels_bought
            rep += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(tab))
            print(' '.join(tab))
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

- The original program has logical issues in the price calculation and loop termination conditions.
- The corrected code ensures that the prices are set correctly and the loop terminates when `k` is zero, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
