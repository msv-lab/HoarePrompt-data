The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string elements, each representing a value of `number` from each iteration, `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop. If `k` is 0, `tab` contains `rep` string elements, and `i` is the last string element in `tab`. Otherwise, `k` is not equal to 0.**
