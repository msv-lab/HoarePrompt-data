Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be non-zero, `k` is `k - Max` and must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Min`.**

Explanation:
- `k` is updated to `k - Max`, where `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`, `number`) remain unchanged.
- The condition that `k` must be greater than 0 is still valid, as `k` is updated to `k - Max`.
- The condition that `n` must be greater than or equal to `k` is still valid, as `n` and `k` are both updated but the relationship between them is maintained.
- The values of `Min` and `Max` are still based on the current values of `n` and `k`.
- The list `tab` still contains the string representation of `number`.
- The value of `number` remains `Min`.
