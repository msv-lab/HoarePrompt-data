Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than zero, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is 0, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.**

Explanation:
- The variables `t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, and `number` remain unchanged.
- `Min` is assigned the value of the minimum between `n // k` and `k`.
- `Max` is assigned the value of the maximum between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
- `n // k` is the integer division of `n` by `k`.
- `int(n / k)` is the integer part of the division of `n` by `k`, which is the same as `n // k` for positive integers.
- Since `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `n // k` will be at least 1, and `int(n / k)` will be the same value.
- Therefore, `Min` will be the smaller value between `n // k` and `k`, and `Max` will be the larger value between `int(n / k)` and `k`.
