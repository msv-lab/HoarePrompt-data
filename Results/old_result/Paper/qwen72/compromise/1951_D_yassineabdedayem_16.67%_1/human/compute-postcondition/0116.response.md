Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be non-zero, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than zero, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is either `min(n // k, k)` or `max(int(n / k), k)`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `k` is set to 0. Otherwise, `k` is set to `k - min(n // k, k)` and `number` is set to `Max`.***
