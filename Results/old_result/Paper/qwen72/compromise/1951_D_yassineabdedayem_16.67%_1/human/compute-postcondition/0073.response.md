Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is non-zero and greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is positive, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing a single string element `str(Max)`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, `number` is `Max`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `number` is updated to `Max`.
- The list `tab` now contains a single string element `str(Max)` because `number` is now `Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged.
