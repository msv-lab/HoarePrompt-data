Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the first integer read from the input and must be greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is the second integer read from the input and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 0, `tab` is an empty list, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`, and either `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`.**

Explanation:
- `number` is assigned the value of `Max`.
- All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `rep`, `tab`, `Min`, `Max`) remain unchanged.
- The conditions specified in the initial state are still valid.
