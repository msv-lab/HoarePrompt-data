To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition:

```
while n != 0 and k > 0 and (rep < 60) and (n >= k):
```

The loop will continue to execute if:
1. `n` is not equal to 0.
2. `k` is greater than 0.
3. `rep` is less than 60.
4. `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `_` is 2 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `n` is `n - Min * Max`.
- `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, otherwise `k` is 0.
- `rep` is 1.
- `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number` (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `number` is `Max` (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`.
- `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`n` is not equal to 0**:
   - `n` is updated to `n - Min * Max`. For `n` to not be 0, the new value of `n` must be greater than 0.

2. **`k` is greater than 0**:
   - `k` is updated based on the condition:
     - If `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, then `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)`.
     - Otherwise, `k` is 0.
   - For `k` to be greater than 0, the new value of `k` must be greater than 0.

3. **`rep` is less than 60**:
   - `rep` is 1, which is less than 60. This condition is already satisfied and does not need adjustment.

4. **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`**:
   - After updating `n` and `k`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- **`n`** must be greater than 0 after the update.
- **`k`** must be greater than 0 after the update.
- **`n`** must be greater than or equal to `k` after the update.

### Conclusion:
Given the current state, we need to ensure that `n` and `k` are adjusted such that the loop conditions are met. However, since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we can only express the conditions that must be true for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is `n - Min * Max` and must be greater than 0, `k` is `k - min(n // k, k)` if `Max` is not equal to `k` or `n * Min` is greater than `k`, otherwise `k` is 0 and must be greater than 0, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `number` is `Max`, `Min` is `min(n // k, k)`, `Max` is `max(int(n / k), k)`, and `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`**.
