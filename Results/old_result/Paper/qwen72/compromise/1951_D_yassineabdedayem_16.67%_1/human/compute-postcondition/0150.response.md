Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is 0, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The value of `t` remains unchanged as it is an input integer and is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `_` remains 2, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `k` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- The value of `rep` is the total number of times the loop executed, which can be up to 60.
- The list `tab` contains the string representations of all the `number` values generated during each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `number` holds the last value of `number` that was generated in the loop.

The loop iterates over each element in the list `tab` and prints it, so after all iterations, the list `tab` will still contain all the string representations of the `number` values, and the variable `number` will hold the last value that was generated. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
