To determine what will be printed by the `print(i, end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `_` is 2.
   - `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop.
   - `k` is 0.
   - `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60).
   - `tab` is a list containing at least one string representation of a `number` value.
   - `i` is the first element of `tab`.
   - `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop.

2. **Context:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement is printing the first element of the list `tab`.

3. **Analysis:**
   - `tab` is a list that contains at least one string representation of a `number` value.
   - `i` is the first element of `tab`.
   - Since `tab` contains string representations of numbers, `i` is a string.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i, end=' ')` statement will print the first element of the list `tab`, which is a string representation of a number, followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the context, the output will be the first element of the list `tab` followed by a space.

Output: **[i] (where i is the first element of the list tab, which is a string representation of a number)**
