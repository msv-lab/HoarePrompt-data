Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 2, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is a positive integer less than the initial `k` and such that the loop conditions are no longer met, `rep` is the number of times the loop executed (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing the string representations of the `number` values generated during each iteration, and `number` is the last value of `number` generated in the loop. Additionally, `k` is not equal to 0.**
