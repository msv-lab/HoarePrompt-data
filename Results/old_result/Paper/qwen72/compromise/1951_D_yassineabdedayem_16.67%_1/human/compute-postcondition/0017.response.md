The code snippet `rep += 1` increments the variable `rep` by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 0, `n` is `n - Min * Max`, `k` is a positive integer, `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`, `rep` is 1, `tab` is a list containing the string representation of `number`, `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`, `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`. If `Max` is equal to `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, then `number` is `Min` and `k` is 0. Otherwise, `number` is `Max` and `k` is `k - Min`.**
