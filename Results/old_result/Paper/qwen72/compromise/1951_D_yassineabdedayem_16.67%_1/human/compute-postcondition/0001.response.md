The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the loop is iterating over the range of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` is already given as an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, which ensures that `t` is positive and the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is a dummy variable starting from 0**
