Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `_` is 1, `n` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `k` is the remaining value after all iterations of the loop, `rep` is the total number of iterations (up to 60), `tab` is a list containing up to 60 string elements, each representing a value of `number` from each iteration, `number` is the last value assigned to it during the loop.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`_`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`n`**: After the loop finishes, `n` will be the remaining value after all iterations. The loop modifies `n` by subtracting `Min * Max` in each iteration.
- **`k`**: After the loop finishes, `k` will be the remaining value after all iterations. The loop modifies `k` by subtracting either `Max` or `Min` in each iteration, depending on the conditions.
- **`rep`**: This is the total number of iterations the loop has executed, which is up to 60. If the loop exits early due to the conditions, `rep` will be less than 60.
- **`tab`**: This is a list containing up to 60 string elements, each representing the value of `number` from each iteration. The number of elements in `tab` will be equal to `rep`.
- **`number`**: This is the last value assigned to `number` during the loop. It will be either `Min` or `Max` depending on the conditions in the last iteration.

The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is non-zero, `k` is positive, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. Each iteration updates `n`, `k`, and `tab` based on the values of `Min` and `Max`, and the final state reflects these changes.
