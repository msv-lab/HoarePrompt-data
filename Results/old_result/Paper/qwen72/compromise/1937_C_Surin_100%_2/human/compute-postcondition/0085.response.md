The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than `kp + 1` (where `kp` is `kp + 1` from the previous state). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Given that `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, it will be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration. The condition for the loop to continue is that `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `v2` is 1, `r` is `<`, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is not `<`, the values of `n`, `i`, `prev`, `kp`, `g`, `v1`, `v2`, and the output buffer remain unchanged.**
