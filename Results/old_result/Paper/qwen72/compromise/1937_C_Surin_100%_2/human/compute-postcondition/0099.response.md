Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `<` at the last iteration, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The loop has run from `i = 1` to `i = n-1`.
- The variable `v2` will be equal to `n-1` because it is set to the current value of `i` in each iteration.
- The variable `v1` will be the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `<`. If `r` was never `<`, `v1` will be the last value of `v2` where `r` was not `<`.
- The variable `prev` will be the last value of `i` for which the input `r` was `>` or the last value of `i` for which `r` was `=` and `r2` was `<`. If no such `i` exists, `prev` remains 0.
- The variable `kp` will be `kp + 1` as it is incremented once at the beginning.
- The variable `g` remains 0 as it is not modified in the loop.
- The output buffer has been flushed after each iteration, ensuring that all outputs have been processed.
