Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is 2, `r` is the new input string, the output buffer has been flushed, and `v1` is 2.**

The code snippet `v1 = v2` assigns the value of `v2` to `v1`. Since `v2` is 2, `v1` is now 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
