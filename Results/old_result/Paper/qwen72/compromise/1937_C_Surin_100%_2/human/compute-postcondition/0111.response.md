The code snippet `r2 = input('')` takes a new input string and assigns it to the variable `r2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `r2` is unknown as it depends on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`. Additionally, `r` is `=` and not `>`. `r2` is a new input string.**
