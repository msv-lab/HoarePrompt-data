Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is the last value of `i` where `r` was `>` or `=`, `kp` is `kp + 2`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the final input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**

The value of `g` has been reset to 0, and all other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
