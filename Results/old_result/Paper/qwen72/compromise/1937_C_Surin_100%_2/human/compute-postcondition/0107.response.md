Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the new input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If the previous `r` was `<`, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`. Additionally, `r` is not `>`**.
