Let's break down the initial state and the `print` statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is greater than 2.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `r` is an input string.
   - The output buffer has been flushed.
   - If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is `=`, `r2` is an input string, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 1.
   - Otherwise, `r` is not `>` and not `=`, and the state of `r2` and `prev` remains unchanged.

2. **Determine the value of `prev`:**
   - If `r` is `>`, then `prev` is 1.
   - If `r` is `=`, then `r2` is checked:
     - If `r2` is `<`, then `prev` is 1.
     - If `r2` is not `<`, then `prev` remains unchanged.
   - If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, then `prev` remains unchanged.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The statement `print(f'? {i} {i} {prev} {prev}')` will print a formatted string with the values of `i` and `prev`.

4. **Values to be printed:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `prev` depends on the value of `r` and possibly `r2`:
     - If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1.
     - If `r` is `=`, and `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 1.
     - If `r` is `=`, and `r2` is not `<`, `prev` remains unchanged.
     - If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains unchanged.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `prev` if `r` is not `>` or `=`, we need to consider the possible values of `prev`:

- If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1.
- If `r` is `=`, and `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 1.
- If `r` is `=`, and `r2` is not `<`, `prev` remains unchanged (initially unspecified).
- If `r` is neither `>` nor `=`, `prev` remains unchanged (initially unspecified).

Given the lack of information about the initial value of `prev` if it is not set by the conditions, we can only provide a precise description based on the conditions given:

Output: **? 2 2 [prev] [prev] (where [prev] is 1 if `r` is `>` or if `r` is `=` and `r2` is `<`, otherwise [prev] remains unchanged and its value is unspecified)**
