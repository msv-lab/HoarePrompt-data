Output State: **`kp` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `g` is 0, `v1` is 1, `i` is 2, `v2` is 2, the output buffer has been flushed, `r` is the input string provided by the user. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.**

The `sys.stdout.flush()` function call ensures that the output buffer is flushed, but it does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, all the initial state conditions remain unchanged.
