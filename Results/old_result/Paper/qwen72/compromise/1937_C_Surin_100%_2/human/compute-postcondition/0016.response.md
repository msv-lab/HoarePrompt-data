Based on the initial state provided:

- `kp` is 0
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `g` is 0
- `v1` is 1
- `i` is 2
- `v2` is 2
- The output buffer has been flushed
- `r` is the input string provided by the user. If `r` is '<', the current value of `r` is '<'.

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

Let's break down the values used in the print statement:
- `v1` is 1
- `v1` is 1 (again)
- `v2` is 2
- `v2` is 2 (again)

So, the formatted string will be:
```
? 1 1 2 2
```

Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
