Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `r` is an input string, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `>`, `prev` is 1. If `r` is `=`, `r2` is an input string, and if `r2` is `<`, `prev` is 1. Otherwise, `r` is not `>` and not `=`, and the state of `r2` and `prev` remains unchanged.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` has been executed, which ensures that the output buffer is flushed. However, this operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `r`, `r2`, or `prev`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
