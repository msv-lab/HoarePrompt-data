Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `kp + 1`, `i` is `n-1`, `prev` is 0, `kp` is `kp + 1`, `g` is 0, `v2` is `n-1`, `r` is the input string from the last iteration, and the output buffer has been flushed. If `r` is `<` at the last iteration, `v1` is `n-1`. Otherwise, `v1` is the value of `v2` from the last iteration where `r` was not `<`.**

The code snippet `prev = 0` resets the value of `prev` to 0, overriding any previous value it might have had. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
