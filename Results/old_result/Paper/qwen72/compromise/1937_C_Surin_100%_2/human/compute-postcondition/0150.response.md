Based on the initial state provided:

- `v1` is 0.
- `v2` is 1.

The print statement is:
```
print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
```

This statement will print a formatted string where the placeholders `{v1}` and `{v2}` are replaced with the values of the variables `v1` and `v2` respectively.

Substituting the values:
- `{v1}` will be replaced with `0`.
- `{v2}` will be replaced with `1`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
