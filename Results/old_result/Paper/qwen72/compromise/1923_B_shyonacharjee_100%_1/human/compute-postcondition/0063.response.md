The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1. After the iteration, `t` is decreased by 1, so for the next iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop broke or finished, `can_survive` is True if the loop completes without breaking due to the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k`, otherwise `can_survive` is False.**
