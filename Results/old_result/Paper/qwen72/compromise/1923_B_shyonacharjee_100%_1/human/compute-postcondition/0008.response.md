The only objects in the loop head are the variables `pos` and `health`, and the list `monsters`. For the loop to execute, the list `monsters` must contain at least one tuple. The variables `pos` and `health` will take the values of the first tuple in `monsters` during the first iteration.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, where each tuple consists of an element from `x` and the corresponding element from `a`, and `monsters` must have at least 1 tuple, `bullets_used` is 0, `can_survive` is True, `pos` is the first element of the first tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the first tuple in `monsters`**
