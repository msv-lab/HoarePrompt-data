Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `x` is a list of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the monsters processed, `can_survive` is False if at any point the total bullets needed exceeds the distance multiplied by `k` for any monster, otherwise `can_survive` remains True.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The `monsters` list is still sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple.
- `bullets_used` is the total sum of the health values of all the monsters that were processed in the loop.
- `can_survive` will be False if at any point during the loop, the total number of bullets needed (which is the cumulative sum of the health values of the monsters processed so far) exceeds the product of the distance of the current monster and `k`. If this condition is never met, `can_survive` remains True.
