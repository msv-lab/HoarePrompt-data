Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, where each tuple consists of an element from `x` and the corresponding element from `a`, and `monsters` must have at least 2 tuples. `bullets_used` is `health`, `pos` is the first element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `health` is the second element of the second tuple in `monsters`, `distance` is the absolute value of `pos`, and `total_bullets_needed` is `bullets_used + health`. If `total_bullets_needed` is greater than `distance * k`, `can_survive` is False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with `can_survive` remaining True.***
