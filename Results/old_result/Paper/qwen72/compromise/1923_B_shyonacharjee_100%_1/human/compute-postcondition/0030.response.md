Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, where each tuple consists of an element from `x` and the corresponding element from `a`. `bullets_used` is the sum of the `health` values of all the tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop broke or completed. `can_survive` is True if the loop completed without breaking, or False if the loop broke because `total_bullets_needed` exceeded `distance * k` at any point.**

In natural language, this means:
- The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged.
- The `monsters` list is still sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple.
- `bullets_used` is the total sum of the `health` values of the monsters that were processed before the loop either completed or broke.
- `can_survive` is True if the loop completed without breaking, meaning the total bullets needed never exceeded the product of the distance and `k` for any monster. If the loop broke because at any point the total bullets needed exceeded the product of the distance and `k`, `can_survive` is False.
