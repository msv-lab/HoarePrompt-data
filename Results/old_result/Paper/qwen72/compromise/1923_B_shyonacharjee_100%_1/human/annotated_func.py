#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), x is a list of n integers (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n; x_i ≠ 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        monsters = sorted(zip(x, a), key=lambda p: abs(p[0]))
        
        bullets_used = 0
        
        can_survive = True
        
        for pos, health in monsters:
            distance = abs(pos)
            total_bullets_needed = bullets_used + health
            if total_bullets_needed > distance * k:
                can_survive = False
                break
            bullets_used += health
        
        print('YES' if can_survive else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n` and `k` are input integers, `a` and `x` are lists of integers provided by the user, `monsters` is a list of tuples sorted by the absolute value of the first element of each tuple, `bullets_used` is the sum of the health values of all the tuples in `monsters` that were processed before the loop broke or completed for each test case, `can_survive` is True if the loop completed without breaking due to the condition `total_bullets_needed > distance * k` for each test case, or False if the loop broke because `total_bullets_needed` exceeded `distance * k` at any point for any test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters `n` and the maximum distance `k` that a bullet can travel. It then reads two lists: `a`, which contains the health of each monster, and `x`, which contains the positions of each monster. The function determines whether it is possible to defeat all the monsters by shooting them in an order that minimizes the total distance traveled by the bullets. If it is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is that all test cases have been evaluated and the corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' results have been printed.
