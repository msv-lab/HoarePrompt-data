It seems there is a mismatch between the problem description and the provided function definition. The problem description suggests that the function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the number of monsters, the number of bullets you can fire, the health of each monster, and the positions of each monster. However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters.

Given the problem description, the function definition should be updated to reflect the necessary parameters. Here is a corrected function definition and the corresponding precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def can_survive(t, n, k, a, x):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 3 · 10^4), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5), k is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^9), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), x is a list of n integers (-n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < ... < x_n ≤ n; x_i ≠ 0). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
