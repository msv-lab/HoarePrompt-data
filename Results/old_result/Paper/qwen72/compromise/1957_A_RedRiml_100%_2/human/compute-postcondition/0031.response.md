Output State: **`pl` is a list containing all unique elements from `palka` in the order they first appeared and must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element of `pl`, `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `shapes` is increased by `d[j] // 3`.**

Explanation: The value of `shapes` is incremented by the integer division of `d[j]` by 3. The integer division `d[j] // 3` will result in a whole number, which is added to `shapes`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
