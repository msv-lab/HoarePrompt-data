Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the third element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that may contain the first and second elements of `palka`. If `i` is not in `pl`, the third element `i` from `palka` is appended to the list `pl`. If `d.get(i) == None`, the dictionary `d` now includes the key `i` with the value 1. If `d.get(i) != None` and `i` is in `pl`, `pl` and `d` remain unchanged. If `d.get(i) != None` and `i` is not in `pl`, `pl` now contains the third element of `palka`, and the value associated with `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.***
