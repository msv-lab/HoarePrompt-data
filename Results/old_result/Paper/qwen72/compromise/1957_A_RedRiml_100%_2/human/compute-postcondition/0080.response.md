To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the computation of `shapes` step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `palka` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `pl` is a list of unique elements from `palka`.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that element appears in `palka`.
   - `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - `_` is incremented by the number of elements in `palka` for each iteration.
   - `w` is greater than the current value of `_`.
   - `ln` is an input integer (though it is not used in the given code snippet).

2. **Computation of `shapes`:**
   - For each unique element `j` in `pl`, we check if `d[j]` (the count of `j` in `palka`) is greater than or equal to 3.
   - If `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, we compute `d[j] // 3` and add this value to `shapes`.
   - `shapes` is the sum of all such values.

3. **Explanation:**
   - `shapes` represents the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the counts of each unique element in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.
   - For example, if `palka` is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`, then:
     - `pl` would be `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - `d` would be `{1: 3, 2: 4, 3: 2}`.
     - For `j = 1`, `d[1]` is 3, so `3 // 3` is 1.
     - For `j = 2`, `d[2]` is 4, so `4 // 3` is 1.
     - For `j = 3`, `d[3]` is 2, so it is not included in the sum.
     - Therefore, `shapes` would be `1 + 1 = 2`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will print the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the counts of each unique element in `palka` that appear at least 3 times.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the total number of groups of 3 that can be formed from the counts of each unique element in `palka` that appear at least 3 times)**
