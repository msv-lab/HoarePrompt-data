Postcondition: **`palka` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` where `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `w` is greater than the new value of `_`, `ln` is an input integer, `pl` is a list containing the first integer from `palka` if `i` was not already in `pl`, and `d` is a dictionary. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, `d` now contains the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.**
