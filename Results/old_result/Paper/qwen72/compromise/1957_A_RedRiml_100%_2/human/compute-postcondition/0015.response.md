The only objects in the loop head are the list `palka` and the variable `i`. The loop can execute again if there is another element in `palka` to be assigned to `i`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100
- `w` must be greater than 0
- `ln` is an input integer
- `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 1 element
- `i` is the first element in `palka`
- `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`
- `d` is a dictionary that includes the key `i` with the value 1 if `i` was not already a key in `d`, or the value associated with `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `d`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `palka` must have at least 2 elements
- `i` will be the second element in `palka`

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0; `ln` is an input integer; `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `palka`, `pl` is a list that may contain the first element of `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary that includes the key `i` with the value 1 if `i` was not already a key in `d`, or the value associated with `i` is incremented by 1 if `i` was already a key in `d`**
