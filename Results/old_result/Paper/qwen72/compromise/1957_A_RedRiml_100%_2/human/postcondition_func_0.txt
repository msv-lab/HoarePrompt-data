The function `func` reads an integer `w` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the length of a list, followed by the list of integers `palka`. It then calculates the number of groups of three identical integers that can be formed from `palka` and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any values and does not modify the initial state of `t`, `n`, or `a_i`. After the function concludes, the program state is such that `w` test cases have been processed, and the number of groups of three identical integers has been printed for each test case.
