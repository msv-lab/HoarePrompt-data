The function `solve` is part of a program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case contains a single integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function should be called within a loop that iterates over the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
