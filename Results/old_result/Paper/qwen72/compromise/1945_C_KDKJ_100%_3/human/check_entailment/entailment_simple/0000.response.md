### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `a` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the prefix sums of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores them in the list `S`.
   - `S[i]` contains the count of '0's and '1's from the start of the string up to the `i-1`-th character.
   - This is done correctly by iterating over the string and updating the counts accordingly.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program then iterates over all possible positions `i` where the road can be laid (from 0 to `n`).
   - For each position `i`, it calculates the number of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It checks if the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the left side and if the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the right side.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it updates the answer `ans` if the current position `i` is closer to the middle of the village than the previously found position.

4. **Output**:
   - After checking all positions, the program prints the position `i` that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village.
   - If no position satisfies the conditions, `ans` remains -1, but the problem guarantees that an answer always exists, so this case should not occur.

### Analysis of the Conditions:
- The condition `left * 2 < lsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the left side are satisfied.
- The condition `right * 2 < rsum` ensures that at least half of the residents on the right side are satisfied.
- The condition `abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans)` ensures that the chosen position `i` is as close to the middle of the village as possible.

### Potential Issues:
- The program correctly handles the prefix sums and the conditions.
- The program correctly updates the answer to the position that is closest to the middle of the village.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` within a loop in `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It calculates the prefix sums, checks the conditions for each possible road position, and selects the optimal position that satisfies the conditions and is closest to the middle of the village.

### Correctness:
