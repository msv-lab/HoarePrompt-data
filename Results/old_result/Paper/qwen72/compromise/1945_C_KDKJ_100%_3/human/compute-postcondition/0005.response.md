Output State: **`S` is a list containing `n+1` sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` at index `i` (0-indexed) represents the count of '0's and '1's from the start of the string `a` up to the `i-1`-th character. The last sublist in `S` will be `[count of '0's in a, count of '1's in a]` and the first sublist remains `[0, 0]`. `ans` is -1.**
