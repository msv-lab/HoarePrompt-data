Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the user, where `a` consists only of '0' and '1'. It then computes and prints the index `i` (0-indexed) that minimizes the absolute difference between `n / 2` and `i`, while ensuring that the number of '0's in the left part of the string (up to index `i-1`) is at least half the length of the left part, and the number of '1's in the right part of the string (from index `i` to the end) is at least half the length of the right part. If no such index exists, it prints `-1`. **
