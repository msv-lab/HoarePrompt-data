Let's break down the initial state and the provided code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than the length of the list `l`.
2. `i` is the length of the list `l` + 1.
3. `a` is a new input string.
4. `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `a` and converting each element to an integer.
5. `n` is equal to the first integer in the new list `b`.
6. `f` is equal to the second integer in the new list `b`.
7. `k` is equal to the third integer in the new list `b`.
8. `o` is a list of strings obtained from the new input and split, sorted in descending order.
9. `fav` is the string at the index `f - 1` in the sorted list `o`.
10. `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of how many times that string appears in `o`.
11. `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order.
12. If `k` is equal to `n`, all the above conditions hold true.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('NO')
```

### Analysis:
- The code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that prints the string `'NO'`.
- The initial state provides a lot of information about various variables and lists, but none of this information is used in the `print` statement.
- The `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the string `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
