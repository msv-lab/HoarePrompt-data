The `print('MAYBE')` statement will print the string 'MAYBE' regardless of the initial state of the program. The initial state describes the values of variables `t`, `i`, `a`, `b`, `n`, `f`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the `print` statement will simply output the string 'MAYBE'.

Output: **MAYBE**
