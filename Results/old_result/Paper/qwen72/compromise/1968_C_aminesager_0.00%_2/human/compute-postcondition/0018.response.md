Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` remains unchanged, `a` has `n` elements and the elements of `a` are reversed as described, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, and `t` is `True - 1` (which results in an error since `True` is a boolean and cannot be subtracted from).**

Explanation: The code attempts to subtract 1 from `t`, which is a boolean value (`True`). This operation is invalid because booleans cannot be used in arithmetic operations like subtraction. Therefore, an error occurs, and the state of the other variables remains unchanged.
