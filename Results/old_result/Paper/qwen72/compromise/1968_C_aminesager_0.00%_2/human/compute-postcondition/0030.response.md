The code snippet `a = a[::-1]` reverses the list `a`. Let's analyze the impact:

- `a` was initially `[1000, 1000 - T[0], (1000 - T[0]) - T[1], ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2])]`.
- After reversing, `a` becomes `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`.

The other variables (`i`, `n`, `result`, `t`, `line`, `T`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` results in an error, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.**
