Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `a` is `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` is `0`, `line` is the new input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the new `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation:
- The code appends a new element to the list `a`. This new element is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.
- Since `i` is 1, `i - 1` is 0.
- Therefore, the new element appended to `a` is `a[0] - T[0]`, which is `1000 - T[0]`.
- The updated list `a` is now `[1000, 1000 - T[0]]`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `result`, `t`, `line`, `T`) remain unchanged.
