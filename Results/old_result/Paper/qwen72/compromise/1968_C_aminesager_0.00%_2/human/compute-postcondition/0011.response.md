The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `a` has three elements: `a[0]`, `a[1]` which is `a[0] - T[0]`, and `a[2]` which is `(a[0] - T[0]) - T[1]`**
