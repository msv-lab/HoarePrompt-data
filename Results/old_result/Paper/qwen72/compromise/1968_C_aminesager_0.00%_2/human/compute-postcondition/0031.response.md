Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` is an input integer, `a` is `[(1000 - T[0] - T[1] - ... - T[n-2]), ..., (1000 - T[0] - T[1]), (1000 - T[0]), 1000]`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces, `t` results in an error, `line` is an input string, `T` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `line` and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `result = ' '.join(map(str, a))` converts each element of the list `a` to a string and joins them with spaces, updating the `result` variable.
- The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers, and `result` was initially a string containing the elements of `a` separated by spaces. After executing the code, `result` is updated to the same string, but explicitly constructed from the elements of `a`.
- All other variables (`i`, `n`, `t`, `line`, and `T`) remain unchanged.
