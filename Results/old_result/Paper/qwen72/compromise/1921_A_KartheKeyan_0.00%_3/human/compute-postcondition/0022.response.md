Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `n - 1` (where `n` must be greater than 1), `coord` is an empty list, `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`, `x` and `y` are input integers, `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second tuples in `coord` (which are now undefined because `coord` is empty), `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord` (which are now undefined because `coord` is empty).**
