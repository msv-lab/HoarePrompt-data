Output State: **`i` is 3, `coord` is a sorted list with 7 elements, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `n` is `n - 2` (where `n` must be greater than or equal to 2).**

The `coord` list is now sorted, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The specific values of `p1` and `p2` will be recalculated based on the sorted `coord` list. The values of `i`, `res`, `x`, `y`, and `n` remain as they were in the initial state.
