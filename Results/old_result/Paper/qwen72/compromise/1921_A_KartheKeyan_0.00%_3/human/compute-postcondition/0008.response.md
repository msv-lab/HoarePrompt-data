The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the range value `4`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `4`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is not part of the loop head, it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 1. The range value `4` remains constant and does not change.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `coord` is a list containing the tuple `(x, y)`, `res` is 0, `x` and `y` are input integers.**
