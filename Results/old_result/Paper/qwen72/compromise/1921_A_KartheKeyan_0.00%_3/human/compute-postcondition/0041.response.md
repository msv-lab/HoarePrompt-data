Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is `n - 2` (where `n` must be greater than or equal to 2), `coord` is an empty list, `res` is `abs(math.sqrt(p1) * math.sqrt(p2))`, `x` and `y` are the input integers, `p1` is `(coord[1][0] - coord[0][0])`, `p2` is `(coord[3][0] - coord[2][0])`**

Explanation:
- The variable `coord` is reinitialized to an empty list, so any previous values it held are no longer valid.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `res`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
- The expressions for `p1` and `p2` are still valid, but since `coord` is now an empty list, these expressions will raise an `IndexError` if evaluated. However, the expressions themselves are not evaluated in this snippet, so they remain as they were defined.
