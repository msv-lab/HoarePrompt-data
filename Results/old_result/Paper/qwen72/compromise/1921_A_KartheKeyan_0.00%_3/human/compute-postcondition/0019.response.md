Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `coord` is a sorted list containing the tuples `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, `(x, y)`, and `(x, y)`.
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`.
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `coord` is a list of tuples, and each tuple contains the same values `(x, y)`. Since the list is sorted, the order of the tuples does not change their values.
   - `p1` is the squared distance between the first and second tuples in `coord`. Since both tuples are `(x, y)`, the distance between them is 0, and thus `p1` is 0.
   - `p2` is the squared distance between the third and fourth tuples in `coord`. Similarly, since both tuples are `(x, y)`, the distance between them is 0, and thus `p2` is 0.
   - `res` is the absolute value of the product of the square roots of `p1` and `p2`. Since both `p1` and `p2` are 0, the product of their square roots is 0, and the absolute value of 0 is 0.

3. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print(res)` statement will print the value of `res`.

Given the above analysis, the output of the `print(res)` statement will be:

Output: **0**
