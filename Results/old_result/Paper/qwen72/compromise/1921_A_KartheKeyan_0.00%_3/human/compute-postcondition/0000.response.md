Output State: **The function has executed, and for each test case, it has printed a value `s` which is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2`. The number of test cases `n` has been decremented by 1 for each iteration until `n` reaches 0. The initial state of the list of test cases and the coordinates of the squares remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The variable `n` is initially set to the number of test cases, and it is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the while loop until it reaches 0.
- For each test case, the variable `l` is set to an input value, which is assumed to be the side length of the square.
- The variable `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4*(l//4)))//2` and printed.
- The initial state of the list of test cases and the coordinates of the squares are not affected by the code.
