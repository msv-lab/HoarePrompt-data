### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and increments the count of each element in `cntl`.

3. **Initial Check for MEX 0:**
   - The program checks if the count of `0` in `cntl` is `0`. If so, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `0` is not in the array, the MEX of the final array `c` will be `0`.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The program initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can pick at most two `0`s to maximize the score, and Bob can pick at most one `0` to minimize the score.
   - The program then iterates through the elements from `1` to `n`:
     - If the count of the current element `j` is less than `2`, it means that Bob can pick this element to prevent Alice from picking it twice.
     - The program decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last element. If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct MEX value for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correct Handling of MEX 0:**
  - The program correctly identifies and handles the case where `0` is not in the array, ensuring that the MEX is `0`.

- **Counting Occurrences:**
  - The program correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the array `a` using the `cntl` list.

- **Optimal Moves:**
  - The program correctly initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])` to account for the maximum number of `0`s Alice can pick.
  - The loop through elements from `1` to `n` is designed to find the smallest index `j` where `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, which is a valid approach to determine the MEX. This is because:
    - If `cntl[j]` is less than `2`, Bob can pick this element to prevent Alice from picking it twice.
    - The program decrements `c` each time it finds such an element, ensuring that Alice and Bob are playing optimally.
    - If `c` reaches `0` or `j` is the last element, the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop, which is the correct MEX value.

### Example Walkthrough:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 0 0 1 1`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[2, 2, 0, 0]`
  - `c` is initialized to `min(2, 2) = 2`
  - Loop through `1` to `4`:
    - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 2` (do nothing)
    - `j = 2`: `cntl[2] = 0` (decrement `c` to `1`, print `2` and break)
  - Output: `2`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4 0 1 2 3`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - `c` is initialized to `min(2, 1) = 1`
  - Loop through `1` to `4`:
    - `j = 1`: `cntl[1] = 1` (decrement `c` to `0`, print `1` and break)
  - Output: `1`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `2 1 1`
  - `cntl` after counting: `[0, 2]`
  - `c` is initialized to `min(2, 0) = 0`
  - Output: `0` (since `cntl[0] == 0`)
