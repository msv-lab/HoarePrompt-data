Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the final MEX value of the array `c` after the game is played. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Initialization and Counting Elements**:
   - The program correctly initializes a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each element in `a` and stores them in `cntl`.

2. **Initial Check for MEX 0**:
   - The program checks if the count of `0` in `a` is zero. If so, it prints `0` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because if `0` is not in `a`, the MEX of `c` will be `0`.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining MEX**:
   - The program initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is not the correct approach to determine the MEX value.
   - The program then iterates through the elements from `1` to `n` and subtracts from `c` if the count of the current element is less than `2`. This logic is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally to maximize and minimize the MEX of `c`, respectively.
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest missing number in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing number in `c` to minimize the MEX.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves understanding that Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will always pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` and Bob will pick the smallest number that is not yet in `c` if it is not the same as Alice's pick.
   - The final MEX value will be the smallest number that appears fewer than twice in `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cntl = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]
        for i in a:
            cntl[i] += 1
        
        mex = 0
        for j in range(n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                mex = j
                break
        
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version correctly determines the MEX value by finding the smallest number that appears fewer than twice in the array `a`. This ensures that both Alice and Bob play optimally.
