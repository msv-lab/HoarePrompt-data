The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j`, `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, and `j` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `_` is 2 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` is an input integer (relevant to the loop head)
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user (not relevant to the loop head)
- `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- The element at index 0 in `cntl` is not 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and the value at index 0 in `cntl` (not relevant to the loop head)

To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` must start from 1.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 1**
