Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `j` is 3.
- `c` is decreased by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(j)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `n`**: The value of `n` is greater than 2. However, this variable is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.
2. **Variable `j`**: The value of `j` is explicitly given as 3.
3. **Variable `c`**: The value of `c` is decreased by 1. However, `c` is not used in the `print` statement, so it does not affect the output.

### Output Calculation:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `j`, which is 3.

### Final Output:
Output: **3**
