Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The variable `t` remains an integer greater than 0.
- The variable `_` remains 1.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer.
- The list `a` remains unchanged, containing the integers provided by the user.
- The list `cntl` is now a list of length `n + 1`, where each element at index `i` represents the number of times the integer `i` appears in the list `a`.
