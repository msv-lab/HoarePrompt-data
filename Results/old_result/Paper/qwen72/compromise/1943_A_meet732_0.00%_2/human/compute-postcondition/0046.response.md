Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 3, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, so it changes from 2 to 3.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
