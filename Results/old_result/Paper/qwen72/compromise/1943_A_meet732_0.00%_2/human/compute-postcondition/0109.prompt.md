Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where the element at index `i` (for each `i` in `a`) is the number of times `i` appears in `a`, and all other elements are 0. Additionally, the element at index 0 in `cntl` is not 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and the value at index 0 in `cntl`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing the next statements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `c` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
