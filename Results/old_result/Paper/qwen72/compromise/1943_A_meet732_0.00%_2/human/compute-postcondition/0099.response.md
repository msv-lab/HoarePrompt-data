Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `j` is 2.
- `c` is decreased by 1.

### Code Snippet:
```
print(j)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `n` is greater than 2, but this information is not directly relevant to the `print` statement.
- The variable `j` is explicitly set to 2.
- The variable `c` is mentioned as being decreased by 1, but it is not used in the `print` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the value of `j`, which is 2.

Output: **2**
