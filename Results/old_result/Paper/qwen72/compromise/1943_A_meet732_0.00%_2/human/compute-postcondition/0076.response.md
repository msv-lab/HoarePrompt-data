Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of how many times the corresponding index appears in the list `a`.**

The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the value of `a` to a list of integers provided by the user through input. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, and `cntl`) remain unchanged. The new value of `a` is a list of integers, and the length of `a` is determined by the number of integers provided by the user.
