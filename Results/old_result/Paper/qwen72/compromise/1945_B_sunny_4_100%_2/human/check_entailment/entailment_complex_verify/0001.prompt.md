You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints `ans`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, but the output consists of `t` lines, each containing the value of `ans` for the corresponding test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates the value `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints `ans`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output consists of `t` lines, each containing the calculated value of `ans` for the corresponding test case. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not modified by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's break down the problem and the provided solution to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Firework Launch Intervals:**
   - The first installation launches fireworks every `a` minutes.
   - The second installation launches fireworks every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Objective:**
   - Determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

#### Key Observations:
- A firework launched at time `x` will be visible from `x` to `x + m` inclusive.
- We need to find the maximum number of overlapping intervals of the form `[x, x + m]` and `[y, y + m]` where `x` and `y` are multiples of `a` and `b` respectively.

#### Solution Analysis:
The provided solution calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the first `m` minutes and adds 2 to the result. Let's analyze this step by step:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation:**
   - The solution calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the first `m` minutes as `m // a + 1`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the first `m` minutes as `m // b + 1`.
   - It then adds 2 to the sum of these two values and prints the result.

3. **Correctness of Calculation:**
   - The expression `m // a + 1` correctly calculates the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the first `m` minutes.
   - The expression `m // b + 1` correctly calculates the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the first `m` minutes.
   - However, adding 2 to the sum of these values does not account for the actual overlap of fireworks in the sky. It assumes that there are always two additional fireworks visible, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, we need to consider the overlap of the intervals `[x, x + m]` and `[y, y + m]` where `x` and `y` are multiples of `a` and `b` respectively. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` and using it to determine the maximum overlap.

1. **Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`:**
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` gives the smallest time interval where both installations will launch a firework simultaneously.

2. **Determine the Overlap:**
   - For each multiple of the LCM within the first `m` minutes, count the number of overlapping intervals.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - The maximum number of overlapping intervals will give the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

#### Example Calculation:
For the test case `6 7 4`:
- The LCM of 6 and 7 is 42.
- Within the first 4 minutes, the first installation launches fireworks at times 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and the second installation launches fireworks at times 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42.
- The maximum overlap occurs at time 0 and 42, where both installations launch a firework, resulting in 2 fireworks visible at the same time.

For the test case `7 8 56`:
- The LCM of 7 and 8 is 56.
- Within the first 56 minutes, the first installation launches fireworks at times 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, and the second installation launches fireworks at times 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56.
- The maximum overlap occurs at time 0 and 56, where both installations launch a firework, resulting in 17 fireworks visible at the same time.

#### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not properly account for the overlap of fireworks in the sky. It simply adds 2 to the sum of the number of fireworks launched within the first `m` minutes, which is not a valid approach.
