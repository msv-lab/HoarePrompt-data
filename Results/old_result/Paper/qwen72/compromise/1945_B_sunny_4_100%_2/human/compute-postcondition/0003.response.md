Output State: **The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates `ans` as `m // a + m // b + 2` and prints `ans`. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, but the output consists of `t` lines, each containing the value of `ans` for the corresponding test case.**
