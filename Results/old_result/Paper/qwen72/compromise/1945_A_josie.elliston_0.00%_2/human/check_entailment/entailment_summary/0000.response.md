### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each introvert must have a tent to themselves.
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people.
   - Universals can be in any type of tent.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(extroverts, universals)`:**
     - This function calculates the minimum number of tents required to accommodate the extroverts and universals.
     - If the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3, it checks if the remaining extroverts (i.e., `extroverts % 3`) plus the number of universals is at least 3. If not, it returns `None` because it's impossible to form a tent with exactly 3 people.
     - If it's possible to form the required tents, it returns the ceiling of the division of the sum of extroverts and universals by 3, which gives the minimum number of tents needed.

   - **`func_2(introverts, extroverts, universals)`:**
     - This function first calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` to get the number of tents required for extroverts and universals.
     - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts and universals as required, so `func_2` returns -1.
     - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts (each needing a separate tent) to the result from `func_1` and returns the total number of tents.

3. **Verification with Test Cases:**
   - **Test Case 1: `1 2 3`**
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 2 (need 1 more person to form a tent, which can be provided by a universal)
     - Universals: 3 (1 universal can join the extroverts, 2 universals can share another tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
     - Output: 3 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 2: `1 4 1`**
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (need 2 more people to form 2 tents, but only 1 universal available)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form the required tents)
     - Output: -1 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 3: `1 4 2`**
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 4 (need 2 more people to form 2 tents, which can be provided by 2 universals)
     - Universals: 2 (2 universals can join the extroverts)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
     - Output: 3 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 4: `1 1 1`**
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 1 (need 2 more people to form a tent, but only 1 universal available)
     - Universals: 1 (not enough to form the required tent)
     - Output: -1 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 5: `1 3 2`**
     - Introverts: 1 (1 tent)
     - Extroverts: 3 (can form 1 tent with 3 people)
     - Universals: 2 (can share another tent)
     - Total tents: 1 (introvert) + 2 (extroverts and universals) = 3
     - Output: 3 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 6: `19 7 18`**
     - Introverts: 19 (19 tents)
     - Extroverts: 7 (need 14 more people to form 3 tents, which can be provided by 14 universals)
     - Universals: 18 (14 universals can join the extroverts, 4 universals can share another 2 tents)
     - Total tents: 19 (introverts) + 9 (extroverts and universals) = 28
     - Output: 28 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 7: `0 0 0`**
     - No participants, so no tents needed.
     - Output: 0 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 8: `7 0 0`**
     - Introverts: 7 (7 tents)
     - Extroverts: 0 (no additional tents needed)
     - Universals: 0 (no additional tents needed)
     - Total tents: 7 (introverts)
     - Output: 7 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 9: `0 24 0`**
     - Introverts: 0 (no tents needed)
     - Extroverts: 24 (can form 8 tents with 3 people each)
     - Universals: 0 (no additional tents needed)
     - Total tents: 8 (extroverts)
     - Output: 8 (Correct)

   - **Test Case 10: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`**
     - Introverts: 1000000000 (1000000000 tents)
     - Extroverts: 1000000000 (need 2000000000 more people to form 333333334 tents, which can be provided by 1000000000 universals)
     - Universals: 1000000000 (1000000000 universals can join the extroverts, 0 universals left)
     - Total tents: 1000000000 (introverts) + 666666667 (extroverts and universals) = 1666666667
     - Output: 1666666667 (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the test cases and meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
