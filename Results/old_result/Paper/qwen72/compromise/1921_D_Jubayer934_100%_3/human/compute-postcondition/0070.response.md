Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks, `temp` is -1.**

The code `a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, sorts the resulting list of integers, and then takes the first `n` elements of this sorted list to assign to `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
