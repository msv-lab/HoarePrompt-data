The code snippet `b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` performs the following actions:

1. `input()` is called to read a line of input from the user.
2. `input().split()` splits the input string into a list of substrings based on whitespace.
3. `map(int, input().split())` converts each substring in the list to an integer.
4. `sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)` sorts the list of integers in descending order.
5. `sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]` takes the first `m` elements from the sorted list.

The variable `b` is updated to hold the first `m` elements of the sorted list of integers in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, `a`, `i`, and `temp` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1` if the loop completes all iterations or the index at which the loop breaks, `temp` is -1.**
