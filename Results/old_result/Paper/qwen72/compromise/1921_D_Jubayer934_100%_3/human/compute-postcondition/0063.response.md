Output State: **`temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `n - 1`, `ans` has `n - temp` new elements, each of which is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` from index `temp` to `n - 1`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `temp` remains an integer within the range 0 to `n-1`.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer within the range 1 to 100.
- The variable `i` is now `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The list `ans` has been updated to include `n - temp` new elements. Each of these elements is the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of the lists `a` and `b`, starting from index `temp` and ending at index `n - 1`. The elements of `b` are accessed in reverse order, starting from the end of the list.
