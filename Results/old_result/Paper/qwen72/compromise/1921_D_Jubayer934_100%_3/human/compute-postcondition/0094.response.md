Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `i + 1`, `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n.**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))` appends the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` to the list `ans`.
- The index `i` is incremented by 1.
- The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `temp` remain unchanged.
- The list `ans` now includes the absolute difference between `a[i-1]` and `b[-(n - (i-1))]` as well as the new absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`.
