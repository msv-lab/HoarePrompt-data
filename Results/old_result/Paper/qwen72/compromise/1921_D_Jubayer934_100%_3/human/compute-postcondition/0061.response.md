The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `temp + 1`. For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will be `temp + 2`. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must still be less than `n`.

Given:
- `temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100
- `i` is `temp + 1`
- `ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`

For the next iteration:
- `i` will be `temp + 2`
- `n` remains the same

The loop will execute again if `temp + 2 < n`.

State: **`temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `temp + 2`, `ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]`**
