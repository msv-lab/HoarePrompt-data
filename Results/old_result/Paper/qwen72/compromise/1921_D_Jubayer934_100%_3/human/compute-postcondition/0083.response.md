The loop head involves the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, and the absolute difference between `a[1]` and `b[1]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 2, `temp` remains -1.**
