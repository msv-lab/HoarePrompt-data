The only object in the loop head is the underscore `_`, which is a placeholder variable used to indicate that the loop variable itself is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`.

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. This is because the loop will run `int(input())` times, and if `int(input())` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `a_i` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_i` is a list of `m` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input provided to `int(input())`. This input should be a positive integer, which is consistent with the value of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ `int(input())` ≤ 100)**
