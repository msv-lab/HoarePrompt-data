Output State: **`temp` is an integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `i` is `temp + 2`, `ans` has a new element which is the absolute difference between `a[temp + 2]` and `b[-(n - (temp + 2))]`**

The value of `temp` remains an integer between 0 and n-1, and `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100. The value of `i` is still `temp + 2`. The list `ans` now includes a new element, which is the absolute difference between the value at index `i` in list `a` and the value at index `-(n - i)` in list `b`.
