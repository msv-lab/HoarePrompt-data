Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is an empty list, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 0, `temp` is -1, and the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b` (when `i` is 0) is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`.**
