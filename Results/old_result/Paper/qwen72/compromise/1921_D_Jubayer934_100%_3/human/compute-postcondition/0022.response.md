Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (i.e., `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`), `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is `n-1`, and `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, or -1 if the condition was never met.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` remains an integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `_` remains a placeholder variable.
- The variable `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- The variable `m` remains a positive integer between 1 and 100.
- The list `ans` contains the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` (i.e., `abs(a[i] - b[i])` for each `i` from 0 to `n-1`).
- The list `a` remains the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- The list `b` remains the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- The variable `i` is the last index of the loop, which is `n-1`.
- The variable `temp` is the index `i` where the condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` was first met, or -1 if the condition was never met.
