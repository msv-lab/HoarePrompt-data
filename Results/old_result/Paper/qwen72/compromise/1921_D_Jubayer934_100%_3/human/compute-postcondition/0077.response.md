The code snippet `ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))` appends the absolute difference between the first element of list `a` and the first element of list `b` to the list `ans`.

- `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input.
- `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order.
- `i` is 0, so the first elements of `a` and `b` are accessed.
- `ans` is an empty list initially.

The absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]` is calculated and appended to `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute difference between `a[0]` and `b[0]`, `a` is a list of the first `n` integers from the sorted input, `b` is a list of the first `m` integers from the sorted input in descending order, `i` is 0, and `temp` is -1.**
