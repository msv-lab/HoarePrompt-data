The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a_i` and `b_i` by comparing each element of `a_i` with the corresponding element of `b_i` and the element at the mirrored position from the end of `b_i`. The function prints the sum of these minimum absolute differences for each test case. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.
