You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `_` is a placeholder variable, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 100, `ans` is a list containing the absolute differences between each element of `a` and the corresponding element of `b` up to the index `i` where the loop breaks or completes. If `temp` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ temp < n, `ans` contains the absolute differences from index `temp` to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. If `temp` is -1, `ans` contains the absolute differences from index 0 to `n-1`, and `i` is `n-1`. The loop has completed all `t` test cases, and the sum of `ans` for each test case has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i` with lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of `a_i` and `b_i` by comparing each element of `a_i` with the corresponding element of `b_i` and the element at the mirrored position from the end of `b_i`. The function prints the sum of these minimum absolute differences for each test case. After processing all `t` test cases, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` representing the lengths of the arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - It then reads `n` integers for array `a` and `m` integers for array `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array `b` is sorted in descending order and then the first `m` elements are taken (though this is redundant since `b` is already of length `m`).

3. **Calculating the Maximum Difference:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the differences.
   - It iterates over the first `n` elements of `a` and `b` and calculates the absolute difference between each corresponding pair.
   - The program checks if the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` (i.e., the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `b` that hasn't been used yet) is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` (i.e., the smallest element in `a` and the largest element in `b`).
   - If this condition is met, it breaks the loop and starts appending the differences using `b[-(n - i)]` for the remaining elements.

4. **Summing the Differences:**
   - After the loop, the program sums up all the differences in the `ans` list and prints the result.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The idea of sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is correct because it ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.
  - The program correctly checks if the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`. This is a valid approach to maximize the total difference `D`.
  - The program then correctly appends the differences to the `ans` list and sums them up.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `m = n` by simply using the first `n` elements of `b` in descending order.
  - It also handles the case where all elements in `b` are the same as `a` by correctly calculating the differences and summing them up to zero.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The sorting operations are efficient given the constraints (`n` and `m` are up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)).
  - The program iterates over the elements of `a` and `b` only once after sorting, which is efficient.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c` (constructed from `b`). It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
