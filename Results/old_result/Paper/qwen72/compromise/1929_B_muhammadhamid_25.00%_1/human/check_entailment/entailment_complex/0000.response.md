Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal but not incorrect in this context since it reads input directly from `stdin`.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.

2. **Logic for Minimum Cells to Color**:
   - The function checks if `k` is 1. If so, it prints 1, which is correct because coloring one cell will cover one diagonal.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`. This is correct because in a grid of size `n x n`, you can cover up to `2 * n` diagonals by coloring cells along the main diagonals (both primary and secondary diagonals). Each cell covers two diagonals, so `math.ceil(k / 2)` is the minimum number of cells needed.
   - If `k` is greater than `2 * n`, it prints `k // 2 + 1`. This is also correct because after covering the main diagonals, you need to cover the remaining diagonals. Each additional cell will cover two diagonals, but since you need to cover an odd number of diagonals, you need one extra cell to cover the last diagonal.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly:
     - When `k` is 1, it prints 1.
     - When `k` is equal to `2 * n`, it prints `n`.
     - When `k` is greater than `2 * n`, it correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed.

5. **Overall Functionality**:
   - The function correctly processes the input and produces the expected output for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of its logic and output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
