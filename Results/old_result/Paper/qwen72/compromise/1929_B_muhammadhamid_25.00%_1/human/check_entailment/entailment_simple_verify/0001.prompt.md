You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Even in kindergarten, Sasha liked a girl. Therefore, he wanted to give her a
drawing and attract her attention.

As a drawing, he decided to draw a square grid of size n \times n , in which
some cells are colored. But coloring the cells is difficult, so he wants to
color as few cells as possible. But at the same time, he wants at least k
diagonals to have at least one colored cell. Note that the square grid of size
n \times n has a total of 4n - 2 diagonals.

Help little Sasha to make the girl fall in love with him and tell him the
minimum number of cells he needs to color.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \leq n \leq
10^8 , 1 \leq k \leq 4n - 2 ) — the size of the square grid and the minimum
number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cells that
need to be colored.

Example

Input

    7
    
    3 4
    
    3 3
    
    3 10
    
    3 9
    
    4 7
    
    7 11
    
    2 3

Output

    2
    2
    6
    5
    4
    6
    2
    
Note

In the pictures below, the colored cells are marked in black, and all
diagonals are marked in purple.

In the first test case, you can color 2 cells so that 4 diagonals contain at
least one colored cell:

In the third test case, you can color 6 cells so that all 10 diagonals contain
at least one colored cell:

- Program:

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2), representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.

    #State: The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The loop has executed all iterations and printed the results for each test case, but the function itself has not been updated to match the problem description.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals contain at least one colored cell.
   - The grid has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total (both main and anti-diagonals).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then checks three conditions:
     - If \( k == 1 \), it prints 1. This is correct because if \( k \) is 1, we only need to color one cell to satisfy the condition.
     - If \( k \leq 2n \), it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). This is because each cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal), so we need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells to cover \( k \) diagonals.
     - If \( k > 2n \), it prints \( k // 2 + 1 \). This is because after covering \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells, we need additional cells to cover the remaining \( k - 2n \) diagonals. Each additional cell can cover 2 diagonals, so we need \( (k - 2n) // 2 \) more cells, plus the \( n \) cells already used, which simplifies to \( k // 2 + 1 \).

3. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: \( k == 1 \)**
     - Correct: Only one cell is needed to cover one diagonal.
   - **Case 2: \( k \leq 2n \)**
     - Correct: Each cell can cover 2 diagonals, so \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells are needed.
   - **Case 3: \( k > 2n \)**
     - Correct: After covering \( 2n \) diagonals with \( n \) cells, we need \( (k - 2n) // 2 \) more cells, which simplifies to \( k // 2 + 1 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k \) is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where \( k \) is exactly \( 2n \) correctly.
   - For \( k \) greater than \( 2n \), the program correctly calculates the additional cells needed.

5. **Mathematical Verification:**
   - For \( k \leq 2n \), the ceiling function ensures that we round up to the nearest integer, which is the minimum number of cells needed.
   - For \( k > 2n \), the formula \( k // 2 + 1 \) correctly accounts for the additional cells needed to cover the remaining diagonals.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
