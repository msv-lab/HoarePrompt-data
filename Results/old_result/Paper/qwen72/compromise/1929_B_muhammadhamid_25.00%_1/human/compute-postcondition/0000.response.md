The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1. The state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, but we need to ensure that the input provided will make the loop run at least once. 

However, since we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and the loop head itself is dependent on the input, we can state that the loop will execute if the input is at least 1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
