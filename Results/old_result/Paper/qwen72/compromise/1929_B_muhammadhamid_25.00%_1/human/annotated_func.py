#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2), representing the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        if k == 1:
            print(1)
            continue
        
        if k <= 2 * n:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        else:
            print(k // 2 + 1)
        
    #State: The function `func` is still incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^8, 1 ≤ k ≤ 4n - 2). The loop has executed all iterations and printed the results for each test case, but the function itself has not been updated to match the problem description.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the standard input. It processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `n` and `k`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a single integer representing the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size `n` to ensure at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the results for all test cases have been printed to the standard output.
