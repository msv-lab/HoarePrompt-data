Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the scores are such that they cannot be achieved by any valid set of games and results, even though the sum of the scores is even. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 10
```
The program will output:
```
2
```
However, the correct output should be `-1` because it is impossible to achieve the scores 1, 1, and 10 with the given scoring rules. The maximum number of draws that could have happened is 2, but this would result in scores that are not possible to achieve with the given constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
