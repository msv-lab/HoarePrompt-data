Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical flaw in determining the maximum number of draws. The issue lies in the calculation and the conditions used to determine the maximum number of draws. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Total Points Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the total points as `(a + b + c) // 2` and checks if the total points are even. This is correct because each game contributes 2 points (either 2 for a win and 0 for a loss, or 1 for each player in a draw).

2. **Maximum Draws Calculation**: The program then calculates `y` as `a + b` and prints `min(x, y)`. This is incorrect because the maximum number of draws should be determined based on the total number of games played and the distribution of points.

3. **Correct Approach**: To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
   - The total number of games played is `(a + b + c) // 2`.
   - The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the number of wins. The number of wins can be calculated as the total points minus the number of draws.
   - We need to ensure that the points distribution is consistent with the rules of the game.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = a + b + c
        
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        total_games = total_points // 2
        max_wins = c  # The player with the highest score could have won all their games
        
        if max_wins * 2 > total_points:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        max_draws = total_games - max_wins
        print(max_draws)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Total Points and Games**: We calculate the total points and check if they are even. If not, the scores are invalid, and we print `-1`.
- **Maximum Wins**: The player with the highest score (`c`) could have won all their games. If the maximum possible wins (i.e., `c * 2`) exceed the total points, the scores are invalid, and we print `-1`.
- **Maximum Draws**: The maximum number of draws is the total number of games minus the maximum number of wins.

This corrected program should correctly determine the maximum number of draws for each test case.
