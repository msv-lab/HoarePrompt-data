You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if (a + b + c) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        x = (a + b + c) // 2
        y = a + b
        print(min(x, y))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 500`. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum of `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3) // 2` and `p_1 + p_2` and prints this value. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking for Validity of Scores:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is odd. If it is, the program prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.
   - This check is necessary because the total number of points must be even. Each game results in either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it is a draw). Therefore, the sum of all points must be even.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of points that could have been distributed if all games were draws.
   - The program then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the maximum number of points that the two players with the lowest scores could have earned if all their games were draws.
   - The program prints the minimum of `x` and `y` as the result. This is because the maximum number of draws cannot exceed the total number of points distributed (`x`) or the sum of the points of the two players with the lowest scores (`y`).

4. **Edge Cases and Examples:**
   - For the input `0 0 0`, the sum is 0 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 0.
   - For the input `0 1 1`, the sum is 2 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 1.
   - For the input `1 1 1`, the sum is 3 (odd), so the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `1 1 2`, the sum is 4 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 2.
   - For the input `3 3 3`, the sum is 9 (odd), so the program correctly prints `-1`.
   - For the input `3 4 5`, the sum is 12 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 6.
   - For the input `1 1 10`, the sum is 12 (even), and the maximum number of draws is 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem by ensuring the sum of scores is even and then calculating the maximum number of draws based on the given scores. The logic and calculations are sound and match the requirements of the problem.
