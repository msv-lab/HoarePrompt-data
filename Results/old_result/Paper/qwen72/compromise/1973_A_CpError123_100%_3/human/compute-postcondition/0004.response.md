Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 500`. For each test case, it reads three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that `0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30`. If the sum of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` is odd, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum of `(p_1 + p_2 + p_3) // 2` and `p_1 + p_2` and prints this value. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged. **
