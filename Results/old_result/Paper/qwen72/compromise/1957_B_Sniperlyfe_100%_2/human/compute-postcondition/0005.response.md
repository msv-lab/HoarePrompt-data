The code snippet `nums[0] += k` increments the first element of the list `nums` by the value of `k`. Given the initial state, `nums[0]` is set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\), and `k` is 0. Since `k` is 0, adding `k` to `nums[0]` does not change the value of `nums[0]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: **`nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and the remaining elements filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is exhausted. `k` is 0.**
