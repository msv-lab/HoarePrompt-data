### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence should have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - The sequence is initialized with `n` zeros.
   - The first element of the sequence is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - The remaining sum `k` is then reduced by this value.
   - For the subsequent elements, the function tries to distribute the remaining sum `k` while ensuring that each element is as large as possible but does not exceed the first element plus one. This is done to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - If there is any remaining sum after distributing to the other elements, it is added back to the first element.

3. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The sequence length `n` and the sum `k` are within the given constraints.
   - The function ensures that the sum of the elements is exactly `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized by setting the first element to the largest possible value with all bits set to 1, and then distributing the remaining sum to the other elements.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 5`, the sequence is `[5]`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the sequence is `[1, 2]`, which is correct because `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), and it has the maximum number of 1s.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the sequence is `[5, 0]`, which is correct because `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), and it has the maximum number of 1s.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 51`, the sequence is `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]`, which is correct because `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 51` (binary `110011`), and it has the maximum number of 1s.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is very small, the first element will be `k` itself, and the rest will be zeros.
   - If `k` is very large, the first element will be the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`, and the remaining sum will be distributed to the other elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The logic and implementation are sound and handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
