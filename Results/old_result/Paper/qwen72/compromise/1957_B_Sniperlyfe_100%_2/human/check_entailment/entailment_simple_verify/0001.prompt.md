You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: `nums` is a list of length `n` with the first element `nums[0]` set to \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and the remaining elements filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is exhausted. `k` is 0.
    nums[0] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns the list `nums` where the first element is \(2^{\text{k.bit_length()} - 1} - 1\) and the remaining elements are filled with the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and the remaining `k` until `k` is exhausted. Since `k` is 0, the remaining elements of `nums` are all 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum is `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence should have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is responsible for generating the sequence.
   - The sequence is initialized with `n` zeros.
   - The first element of the sequence is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`. This ensures that the first number has the maximum number of 1s possible.
   - The remaining sum `k` is then reduced by this value.
   - For the subsequent elements, the function tries to distribute the remaining sum `k` while ensuring that each element is as large as possible but does not exceed the first element plus one. This is done to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.
   - If there is any remaining sum after distributing to the other elements, it is added back to the first element.

3. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The sequence length `n` and the sum `k` are within the given constraints.
   - The function ensures that the sum of the elements is exactly `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized by setting the first element to the largest possible value with all bits set to 1, and then distributing the remaining sum to the other elements.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 1` and `k = 5`, the sequence is `[5]`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`, the sequence is `[1, 2]`, which is correct because `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), and it has the maximum number of 1s.
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 5`, the sequence is `[5, 0]`, which is correct because `5 | 0 = 5` (binary `101`), and it has the maximum number of 1s.
   - For `n = 6` and `k = 51`, the sequence is `[3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]`, which is correct because `3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 51` (binary `110011`), and it has the maximum number of 1s.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `k` is very small, the first element will be `k` itself, and the rest will be zeros.
   - If `k` is very large, the first element will be the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`, and the remaining sum will be distributed to the other elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly constructs a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. The logic and implementation are sound and handle the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
