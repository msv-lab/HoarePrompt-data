Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and for each element `a`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the count of this pair to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the total count of beautiful pairs to the results list and returns the results list.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - This function reads the input from standard input.
   - It splits the input into lines and processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the next two lines:
     - The first line of each test case contains `n`, `x`, and `y`.
     - The second line contains the array `arr`.
   - It appends each test case to the `test_cases` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list and prints the results.

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs based on the given conditions. The input handling in `func_2` is also correct and follows the format specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
