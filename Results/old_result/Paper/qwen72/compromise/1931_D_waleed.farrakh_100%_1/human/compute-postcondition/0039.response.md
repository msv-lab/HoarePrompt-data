The only object in the loop head is the variable `a` and the list `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one element, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `arr` has `n` elements, and `test_cases` must have at least 2 tuples, with `(n, x, y, arr)` being the second tuple in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element, and `a` should be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `arr` has `n` elements and must have at least 1 element, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is 0, `a` is the first element in `arr`**
