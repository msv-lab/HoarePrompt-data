Postcondition: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary (previously empty), `count` is `freq[rx, ry]` where `(rx, ry)` is a key in `freq`. `a` is the first element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`, and `current_pair` is a key in `freq`.**
