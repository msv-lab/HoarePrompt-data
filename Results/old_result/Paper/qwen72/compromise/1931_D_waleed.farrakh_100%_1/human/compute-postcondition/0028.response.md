Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an iterable with at least `t` elements, and all elements in `results` have been printed.**

### Explanation:
- **`t` must be greater than 0**: This condition remains unchanged because it is part of the initial state and is not affected by the loop.
- **`test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple**: This condition also remains unchanged because the loop does not modify the `test_cases` list.
- **`results` is an iterable with at least `t` elements**: The loop iterates over `results`, and for the loop to complete all iterations, `results` must have at least `t` elements. Since `results` is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, and `test_cases` contains `t` tuples, `results` will have at least `t` elements.
- **All elements in `results` have been printed**: After the loop has executed all its iterations, all elements in `results` will have been processed and printed.
