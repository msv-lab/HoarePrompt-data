To determine what will be printed by the `print(result)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple.
   - `results` is an iterable with at least one element.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `result` is mentioned in the `print` statement.
   - The initial state does not provide an explicit value for `result`.
   - The initial state only mentions that `results` is an iterable with at least one element.
   - Since `result` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, it is likely that `result` is an element of the `results` iterable.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the value of `result`.
   - Given that `results` is an iterable with at least one element, `result` could be any element from `results`.
   - Without more specific information about the elements in `results`, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`.

Output: **result (where result is an element from the iterable `results`)**
