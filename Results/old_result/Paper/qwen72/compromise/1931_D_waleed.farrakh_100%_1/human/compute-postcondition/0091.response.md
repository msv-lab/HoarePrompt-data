Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `a` is the second element of `arr`, `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is `a % y`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`. If `(rx, ry)` is in `freq`, `count` is updated to the previous value of `count` plus `freq[rx, ry]`, and `freq[current_pair]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `freq` is updated to include the key `(a % x, a % y)` with a value of 1, and `count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_pair = a % x, a % y` updates the value of `current_pair` to be a tuple containing the values `(a % x, a % y)`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`, `results`, and `freq` remain unchanged.
- The updated `current_pair` is now `(a % x, a % y)`.
- All other conditions and values from the initial state remain valid.
