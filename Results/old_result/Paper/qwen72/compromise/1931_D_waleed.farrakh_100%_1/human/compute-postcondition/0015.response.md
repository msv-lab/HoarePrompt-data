The only variables in the loop head are `t` and `_`. The loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 1, `idx` is 5, and `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples: `(n, x, y, arr)` and the new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting `data[3]`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `data[4]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1, but it still needs to be greater than 0. The other variables, `idx` and `test_cases`, are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `idx` is 5, `test_cases` is a list containing two tuples: `(n, x, y, arr)` and the new tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting `data[3]`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting `data[4]`**
