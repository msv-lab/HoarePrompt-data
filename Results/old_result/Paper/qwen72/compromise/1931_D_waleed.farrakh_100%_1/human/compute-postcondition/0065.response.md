Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x` using the third element of `arr`, `ry` is the result of `a % y` using the third element of `arr`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)` using the third element of `arr`. `count` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `current_pair = a % x, a % y` updates the value of `current_pair` to be a tuple containing the results of `a % x` and `a % y`.
- The values of `a`, `x`, and `y` are used to compute `a % x` and `a % y`, which are then assigned to `current_pair`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `a`, `rx`, and `ry` remain unchanged.
- `count` remains unchanged because the code snippet does not modify it.
