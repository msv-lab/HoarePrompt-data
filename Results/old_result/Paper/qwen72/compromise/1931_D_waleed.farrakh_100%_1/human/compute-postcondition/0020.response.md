Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 7 + 2 * (t - 3), `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`. For each tuple, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting the corresponding line in `data`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the next line in `data`.**

In natural language, this means:
- The variable `t` must be greater than 0, indicating that the loop ran at least once.
- The variable `idx` will be 7 plus 2 times the number of additional iterations beyond the first 3 (i.e., `2 * (t - 3)`).
- The list `test_cases` will contain `t` tuples, each representing a test case. Each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, where `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting the corresponding line in `data`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the next line in `data`.
