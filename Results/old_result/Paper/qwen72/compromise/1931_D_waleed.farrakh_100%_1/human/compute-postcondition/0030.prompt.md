You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads from standard input, expecting a specific format where the first line is an integer t representing the number of test cases, followed by t pairs of lines, each pair containing the integers n, x, y and a list of n integers arr.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is 7 + 2 * (t - 3), `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`. For each tuple, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers derived from splitting and converting the corresponding line in `data`, and `arr` is a list of integers derived from splitting and converting the next line in `data`.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list containing at least one tuple, `results` is an iterable with at least `t` elements, and all elements in `results` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `arr`. It processes each test case and returns the results for all test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
