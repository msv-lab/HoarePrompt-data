Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the second element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x`, `ry` is the result of `a % y`, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)`.**

Explanation:
- The code `current_pair = a % x, a % y` creates a new tuple `current_pair` with the values `a % x` and `a % y`.
- `a % x` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `x`.
- `a % y` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
- The values of `test_cases`, `results`, `freq`, `a`, `rx`, `ry`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- The new variable `current_pair` is now a tuple containing the results of `a % x` and `a % y`.
