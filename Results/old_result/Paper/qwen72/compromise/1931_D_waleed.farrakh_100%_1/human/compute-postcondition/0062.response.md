Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the second tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the value of `count`, `freq` is a dictionary, `a` is the third element in `arr`, `rx` is the result of `(-a % x + x) % x` using the third element of `arr`, `ry` is the result of `a % y` using the third element of `arr`, `current_pair` is `(a % x, a % y)` using the third element of `arr`.**

The code snippet `ry = a % y` updates the value of `ry` to the result of `a % y`, where `a` is the third element of `arr` and `y` is the third element of the second tuple in `test_cases`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
