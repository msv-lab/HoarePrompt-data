Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 3 tuples, `(n, x, y, arr)` is the third tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is a list containing the final value of `count` and the new value of `count` appended to it, `freq` is an empty dictionary, `count` is the total number of times a pair `(rx, ry)` has been encountered before it was added to `freq` for all elements `a` in `arr`.**

The `freq` dictionary has been initialized to an empty dictionary, but the other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
