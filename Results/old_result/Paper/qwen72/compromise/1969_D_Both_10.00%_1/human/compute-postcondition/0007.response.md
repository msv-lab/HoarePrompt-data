Functionality: ** The function `func_3` accepts two lists of tuples, `main_ar` and `sec_arr`, where each tuple contains two integers representing item prices for Alice and Bob. It calculates the sum of the first integers in each tuple of `sec_arr` and adds to this sum the first and second elements of all tuples in `main_ar` where the sum of these elements is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns this final sum. The input lists `main_ar` and `sec_arr` remain unchanged. **
