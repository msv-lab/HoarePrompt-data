Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not handle the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob. The function simply adds up the values in `sec_arr` and then adds the values of `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` for elements in `main_ar` where this sum is non-negative. This does not account for the constraints and the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
1 2 1 4
3 3 2 3
```
According to the problem description, Alice should buy items such that her profit is maximized, and Bob will take the k items that minimize Alice's profit. The correct output for this test case should be 0, but the provided program will not produce this result.

To correctly solve the problem, Alice should consider the profit for each item (i.e., `b_i - a_i`) and select the items that maximize her profit while ensuring Bob can only take k items for free. The program needs to sort the items based on their profit and then apply the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.
