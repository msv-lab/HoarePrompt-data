Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads an integer `q` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This aligns with the problem description.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program enters a loop that iterates `q` times, which is appropriate for processing multiple test cases.
3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This is the correct approach for handling space-separated digits as specified in the input format.
4. **Conditional Checks**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` to determine if the digits form a stair. This condition is correctly implemented and matches the problem description.
   - The program checks if `a < b > c` to determine if the digits form a peak. This condition is also correctly implemented and matches the problem description.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, the program prints "NONE". This is the correct fallback for the given problem.
5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate string ("STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE") for each test case, which matches the required output format.

The function summary confirms that the function `func` behaves as expected, reading the inputs, performing the correct checks, and printing the appropriate results. There are no side effects that would affect the program's correctness, and the state of the program remains unchanged except for the printing of results.

Given the above reasoning and the function summary, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
