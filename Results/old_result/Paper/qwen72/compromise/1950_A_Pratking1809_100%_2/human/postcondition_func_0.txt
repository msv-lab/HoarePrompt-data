The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After processing all `q` test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effect of printing the results.
