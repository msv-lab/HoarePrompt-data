You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array of integers such that it has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The length of the array should be at most 200.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print -1.
   - All elements of the array should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Approach:**
   - The program attempts to construct an array by breaking down \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - This is based on the observation that the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as a sum of such terms.
   - For example, if \( X = 13 \), the program will break it down as \( 13 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 1 \).

3. **Algorithm:**
   - The program initializes \( x \) with the input value and subtracts 1 from it.
   - It then iteratively finds the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( x + 1 \) and appends the exponent to `subseq_lens`.
   - It subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \) and updates the maximum exponent `mx`.
   - The loop continues until \( x \) becomes 0.
   - Finally, it constructs the array `ansv` using the exponents found and prints the length and elements of the array.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `x` is set to \( X - 1 \) because the program is considering the number of increasing subsequences as a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - **Finding Exponents:**
     - The inner while loop finds the largest \( i \) such that \( 2^{i+1} \leq x + 1 \).
     - This is equivalent to finding the largest \( i \) such that \( 2^i \leq x \).
     - The program then appends \( i \) to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \( 2^i - 1 \) from \( x \).
   - **Constructing the Array:**
     - The array `ansv` is constructed by first adding the integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
     - Then, it appends the elements from `subseq_lens` (excluding the first element).
   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the length of `ansv` and the elements of `ansv`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Small \( X \):**
     - For \( X = 2 \), the program correctly outputs an array of length 1 with a single element 0.
   - **Large \( X \):**
     - The program should handle large values of \( X \) (up to \( 10^{18} \)) efficiently.
   - **Impossibility:**
     - The program does not explicitly check if it's impossible to construct the array, but it should be able to handle all valid \( X \) within the given constraints.

6. **Correctness:**
   - The program correctly breaks down \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - The construction of the array `ansv` ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The length of the array is at most 200, which is within the problem constraints.
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided. It correctly constructs an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
