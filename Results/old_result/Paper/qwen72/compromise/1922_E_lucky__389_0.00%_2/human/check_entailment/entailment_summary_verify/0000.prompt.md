You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Example

Input

    4
    
    2
    
    5
    
    13
    
    37

Output

    1
    0
    3
    0 1 0
    5
    2 2 3 4 2
    7
    -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1

- Program:
import math

MOD = 1000000007
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    x -= 1
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i)
            x -= 2 ** i - 1
            mx = max(mx, i)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `X` from the input, where `2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18`. It then constructs a list `ansv` of integers such that the list has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The length of `ansv` is at most 200, and its elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If such a list can be constructed, the function prints the length of `ansv` followed by the elements of `ansv` on a single line. If no such list exists, the function prints `0` followed by a blank line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for certain values of \( X \).

### Case Analysis:
1. **Input: \( X = 2 \)**
   - Expected Output: An array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
   - Program Output: 
     ```
     1
     0
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because the array `[0]` has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]` itself).

2. **Input: \( X = 5 \)**
   - Expected Output: An array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
   - Program Output:
     ```
     3
     0 1 0
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because the array `[0, 1, 0]` has more than 5 increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0]` (3)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[0, 1]`, `[1, 0]` (2)
     - Total: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6

3. **Input: \( X = 13 \)**
   - Expected Output: An array with exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - Program Output:
     ```
     5
     2 2 3 4 2
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because the array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has more than 13 increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[2]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[2]` (5)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[3, 4]`, `[3, 2]`, `[4, 2]` (7)
     - Subsequences of length 3: `[2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 3, 4]` (2)
     - Subsequences of length 4: `[2, 3, 4, 2]`, `[2, 3, 4, 2]` (2)
     - Total: 1 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 17

4. **Input: \( X = 37 \)**
   - Expected Output: An array with exactly 37 increasing subsequences.
   - Program Output:
     ```
     7
     -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because the array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has more than 37 increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[-1]`, `[-1]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[-1]` (7)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 2]`, `[-1, 3]`, `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 2]`, `[-1, 3]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, -1]`, `[3, -1]` (14)
     - Subsequences of length 3: `[-1, 0, 2]`, `[-1, 0, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2]`, `[-1, 0, 3]`, `[-1, 2, 3]`, `[0, 2, 3]`, `[0, 2, 3]` (7)
     - Subsequences of length 4: `[-1, 0, 2, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2, 3]` (2)
     - Subsequences of length 5: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1]` (2)
     - Subsequences of length 6: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1]` (1)
     - Subsequences of length 7: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1, -1]` (1)
     - Total: 1 + 7 + 14 + 7 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 35

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly generate arrays that have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
