Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to correctly generate an array that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for certain values of \( X \).

### Case Analysis:
1. **Input: \( X = 2 \)**
   - Expected Output: An array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
   - Program Output: 
     ```
     1
     0
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because the array `[0]` has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]` itself).

2. **Input: \( X = 5 \)**
   - Expected Output: An array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
   - Program Output:
     ```
     3
     0 1 0
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because the array `[0, 1, 0]` has more than 5 increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0]` (3)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[0, 1]`, `[1, 0]` (2)
     - Total: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6

3. **Input: \( X = 13 \)**
   - Expected Output: An array with exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - Program Output:
     ```
     5
     2 2 3 4 2
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because the array `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has more than 13 increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[2]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[4]`, `[2]` (5)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 4]`, `[3, 4]`, `[3, 2]`, `[4, 2]` (7)
     - Subsequences of length 3: `[2, 3, 4]`, `[2, 3, 4]` (2)
     - Subsequences of length 4: `[2, 3, 4, 2]`, `[2, 3, 4, 2]` (2)
     - Total: 1 + 5 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 17

4. **Input: \( X = 37 \)**
   - Expected Output: An array with exactly 37 increasing subsequences.
   - Program Output:
     ```
     7
     -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
     ```
   - This output is incorrect because the array `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has more than 37 increasing subsequences:
     - Empty subsequence: 1
     - Subsequences of length 1: `[-1]`, `[-1]`, `[0]`, `[0]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, `[-1]` (7)
     - Subsequences of length 2: `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 2]`, `[-1, 3]`, `[-1, 0]`, `[-1, 2]`, `[-1, 3]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[0, 2]`, `[0, 3]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, -1]`, `[3, -1]` (14)
     - Subsequences of length 3: `[-1, 0, 2]`, `[-1, 0, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2]`, `[-1, 0, 3]`, `[-1, 2, 3]`, `[0, 2, 3]`, `[0, 2, 3]` (7)
     - Subsequences of length 4: `[-1, 0, 2, 3]`, `[-1, 0, 2, 3]` (2)
     - Subsequences of length 5: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1]`, `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1]` (2)
     - Subsequences of length 6: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1]` (1)
     - Subsequences of length 7: `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -1, -1, -1]` (1)
     - Total: 1 + 7 + 14 + 7 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 35

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly generate arrays that have exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
