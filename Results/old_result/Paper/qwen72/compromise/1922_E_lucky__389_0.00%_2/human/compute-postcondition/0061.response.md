Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `x` is 0.
2. `subseq_lens` is a list containing the largest integers `i` such that \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from the initial `x - 1` without making `x` negative.
3. `i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.
4. `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution.
5. `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx - 1` with the elements `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]` appended to it.

### Analysis:
1. **`x` is 0**: This is given.
2. **`subseq_lens`**: This list contains the largest integers `i` such that \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from `x - 1` without making `x` negative. Since `x` is 0, `x - 1` is -1. No positive integer \(2^i - 1\) can be subtracted from -1 without making it negative. Therefore, `subseq_lens` must be an empty list.
3. **`i` is `len(subseq_lens) - 1`**: Since `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `len(subseq_lens)` is 0. Therefore, `i` is \(0 - 1 = -1\).
4. **`mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop execution**: Since `i` is -1, and there is no loop execution mentioned in the initial state, `mx` is -1.
5. **`ansv`**: This list is constructed by taking integers from 0 to `mx - 1` and appending elements from `subseq_lens[1]` to `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens) - 1]`. Since `mx` is -1, the range from 0 to `mx - 1` is from 0 to -2, which is an empty range. Additionally, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, so there are no elements to append. Therefore, `ansv` is an empty list.

### Print Statement:
```
print(len(ansv))
```
- The `len(ansv)` function will return the length of the list `ansv`.
- Since `ansv` is an empty list, its length is 0.

### Final Output:
Output: **0**
