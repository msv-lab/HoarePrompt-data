Output State: **`x` is now `x - 2`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `i`**. 

The value of `x` remains `x - 2` as it was in the initial state. The value of `mx` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the value of `i`. The previous values of `mx` and `i` are not specified, so the exact value of `mx` after this update is not known, but it is now the greater of the two values.
