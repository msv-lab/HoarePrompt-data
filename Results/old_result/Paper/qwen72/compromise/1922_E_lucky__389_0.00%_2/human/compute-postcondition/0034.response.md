Initial State: `x` is now `x - 2`

```
mx = max(mx, i)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet `mx = max(mx, i)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`. The value of `x` is not affected by this code. Since the initial state only specifies that `x` is now `x - 2`, we do not have specific values for `mx` or `i`. Therefore, `mx` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` is now `x - 2`, `mx` is the maximum of its previous value and `i`.**
