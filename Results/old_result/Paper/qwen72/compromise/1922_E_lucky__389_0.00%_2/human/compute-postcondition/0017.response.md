Output State: **`x` is now `x - 2 ** i + 1`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value of `i`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq x + 1\), and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^i - 1\) from its current value.
- The value of `subseq_lens` remains a list containing the value of `i`.
- `mx` remains 0.
- `i` remains the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq x + 1\), and `i` is not equal to 0.
