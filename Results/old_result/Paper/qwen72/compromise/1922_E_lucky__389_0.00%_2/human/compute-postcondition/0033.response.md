Output State: **`x` is now `x - (2 ** i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i`, `mx` is 0, and `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^{i} \leq x + 1\). Additionally, `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation: The value of `x` is updated by subtracting \(2^i - 1\) from its current value. The other variables `subseq_lens`, `mx`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `i` is the largest integer such that \(2^i \leq x + 1\) and `i` is not equal to 0 still holds.
