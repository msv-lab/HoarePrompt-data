The function `solve` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by a positive integer X (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18). The function should either return -1 if no such array exists, or return a tuple (n, array) where n is the length of the array (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and array is a list of integers of length n, with each element in the range [-10^9, 10^9], such that the array has exactly X increasing subsequences.
