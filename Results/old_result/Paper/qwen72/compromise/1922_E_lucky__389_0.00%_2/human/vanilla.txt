- The program correctly breaks down \( X \) into a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.
   - The construction of the array `ansv` ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly \( X \).
   - The length of the array is at most 200, which is within the problem constraints.
   - The elements of the array are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided. It correctly constructs an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences and handles the constraints appropriately.
