Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails when the string `s` has more than 2 distinct characters but all possible rearrangements of `s` result in a string that is equal to `s`.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
abc
def
ghi
```

For the string `abc`, the program will output:
```
YES
abc
```

However, this is incorrect because `abc` is equal to the original string `s`. The correct output should be a rearranged string that is not equal to `abc`, such as `bac`.

Similarly, for the strings `def` and `ghi`, the program will output the same string, which is not a valid rearrangement according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
