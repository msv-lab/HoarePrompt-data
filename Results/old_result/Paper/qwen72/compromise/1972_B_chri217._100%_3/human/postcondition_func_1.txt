The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `case`, which is a list where the first element is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ case[0] ≤ 100), and the second element is a string of length case[0] containing only 'U' and 'D', representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down). The function returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the input `case` and only evaluates the state of the coins.
