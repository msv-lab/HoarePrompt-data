Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It correctly appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases`.
   - The function returns the list `cases` which contains the correct number of test cases with the correct format.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - The game's winning condition is based on the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`U`).
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player who is about to play will lose because they will eventually be forced to remove the last facing-up coin, leaving the other player with no valid move.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, the player who is about to play can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for the opponent, eventually forcing the opponent to lose.

3. **Implementation of `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` counts the number of facing-up coins (`U`) in the string `s` using a generator expression and the `sum` function.
   - It then checks if the count of `U` is odd or even and returns `YES` if even, and `NO` if odd.
   - This logic is correct because if the number of `U` coins is even, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of `U` coins for Bob, and vice versa.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins (`U`), which results in a loss for the player who is about to play.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one coin left, which is a terminal state and does not affect the parity of the number of `U` coins.

5. **Output**:
   - The output format is correct, printing "YES" or "NO" for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of facing-up coins and the rules of the game.

Correctness: **True**
