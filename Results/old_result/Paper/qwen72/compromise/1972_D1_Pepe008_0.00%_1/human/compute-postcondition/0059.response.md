Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `suma` is 0. If `a - 3 * 2 > 0`, then `x` is set to \((a - 3 * 2) // 9 + 1\). Otherwise, `x` remains unchanged.***
