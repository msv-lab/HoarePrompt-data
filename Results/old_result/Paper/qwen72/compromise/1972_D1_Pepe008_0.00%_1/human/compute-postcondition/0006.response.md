To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the conditions within the loop head. The loop head specifies that `i` should iterate over the range from 1 to `b + 1`. For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be at least 1. The variable `i` starts at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6
- `T` must be greater than 0
- `t` is 0
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]`
- `suma` is 0

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, `b` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is 0, `i` is 1**
