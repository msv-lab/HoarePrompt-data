Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- `T` is greater than 1.
- `t` is 2.
- `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input.
- `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
- `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
- `i` is initialized to `b`.
- `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(suma - 1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of Variables:**
   - `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`.
   - `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1.
   - `i` is initialized to `b`.

2. **Calculation of `suma`:**
   - The expression \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\) is evaluated.
   - This expression simplifies to \(\left(a - b * (b - 1)\right) // b\).
   - Let's denote this result as `term`.
   - `suma` is the sum of this term, but since `i` is only `b` and there is no loop or additional terms, `suma` is simply `term`.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - The print statement outputs `suma - 1`.
   - Therefore, the output is \(\left(\left(a - b * (b - 1)\right) // b\right) - 1\).

### Final Output:
The code prints the value of \(\left(\left(a - b * (b - 1)\right) // b\right) - 1\).

Output: **\(\left(\left(a - b * (b - 1)\right) // b\right) - 1\) (where \(a\) is the integer value of `info[0]` and \(b\) is the integer value of `info[1]`)**
