The provided Python code snippet contains nested loops and conditional checks, but it does not modify any of the variables listed in the initial state. The code only prints certain pairs `(i, j)` based on a condition involving the greatest common divisor (gcd) and modulo operations. Since no variables are updated within the loops, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 1, `t` is 2, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `i` is `b`, `suma` is the sum of \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i\).**
