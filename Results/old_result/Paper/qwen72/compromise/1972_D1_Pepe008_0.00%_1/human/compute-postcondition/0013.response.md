Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` must be greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 1, `suma` is \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\), `i` is 2, `x` is \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\).**

Explanation:
- The code `suma += x` adds the value of `x` to `suma`.
- Initially, `suma` is 0.
- `x` is calculated as \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\).
- After executing `suma += x`, `suma` becomes \((a - 2 \times (2 - 1)) // 2^2 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `i`) remain unchanged.
