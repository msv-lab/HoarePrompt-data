Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6\), `T` is greater than 0, `t` is 0, `info` is a list of strings obtained from the input, `a` is the integer value of `info[0]`, `b` is the integer value of `info[1]` and must be at least 3, `suma` is 0, `i` is 3, `x` is \((a - 3 \times 2) // 3^2 + 1\)**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is calculated using the formula \((a - i \times (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
- Given that `i` is 3, the expression simplifies to \((a - 3 \times 2) // 3^2 + 1\), which further simplifies to \((a - 6) // 9 + 1\).
- All other variables (`n`, `m`, `T`, `t`, `info`, `a`, `b`, `suma`, `i`) remain unchanged.
