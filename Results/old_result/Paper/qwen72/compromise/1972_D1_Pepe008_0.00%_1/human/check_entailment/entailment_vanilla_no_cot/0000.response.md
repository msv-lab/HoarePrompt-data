Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the part of the code that calculates `x` and adds it to `suma` is flawed. The formula used to calculate `x` does not accurately reflect the condition that \(a + b\) should be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        
        suma = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is satisfied. If it is, it increments the count `suma`. Finally, it prints the total count for each test case.

The original program's logic was incorrect, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is **False**.
