### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The provided code reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It initializes a variable `suma` to 0, which will store the count of valid pairs.
   - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - If \(a - i * (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to `suma`.
   - Finally, it prints `suma - 1`.

3. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - This formula is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the derivation and correctness of this formula need to be verified.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not immediately clear and seems to be an optimization or simplification of the original problem.
   - The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) implies that \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - Simplifying this, we get \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which can be rewritten as \(a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\).
   - This suggests that \(a\) must be of the form \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\), where \(k\) is an integer.
   - The provided formula does not directly match this form, and the logic behind it is not clearly explained.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The input and output formats are followed as specified in the problem statement.
   - However, the core logic for counting valid pairs might be incorrect due to the unexplained formula.

### Conclusion:
Given the unclear and potentially incorrect formula used in the code, the program is likely incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
