The function `func_1` is described with parameter constraints but lacks the actual parameters in the function definition. However, based on the given constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `lista_A`, and `lista_B`. 

- `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000.
- `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` and `b_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9.

The output description is missing, but based on the constraints, we can infer that the function might perform some operation on `lista_A` and `lista_B` using `n` and `k`.

Since the output is not provided, I cannot accurately describe the return value. However, I can describe the parameters the function accepts.
