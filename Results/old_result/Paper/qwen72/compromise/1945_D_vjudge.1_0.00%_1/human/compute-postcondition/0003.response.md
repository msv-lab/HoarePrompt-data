The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraint indicates that `numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. This suggests that `numero_testes` might be used within the function, but it is not a parameter passed to the function. Since the output is not specified, we can only infer that the function may perform some operations based on `numero_testes` and return a result, but the exact return value is not provided.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It may perform operations based on a predefined positive integer `numero_testes` (1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4) and return a result, but the specific return value is not specified.**
