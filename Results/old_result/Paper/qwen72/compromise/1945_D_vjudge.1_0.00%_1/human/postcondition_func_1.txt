The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `numero_testes` from user input, where `1 <= numero_testes <= 10^4`. The function then executes `func_1` exactly `numero_testes` times. After the function concludes, the value of `numero_testes` remains unchanged, and the program state reflects that `func_1` has been called the specified number of times.
