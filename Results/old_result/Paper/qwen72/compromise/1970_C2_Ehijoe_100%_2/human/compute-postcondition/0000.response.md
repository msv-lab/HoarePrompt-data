Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated with the values from `input().split()`, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.**

Explanation:
- The values of `n` and `t` are updated based on the input provided by `input().split()`.
- `n` is now an integer value from the input.
- `t` is now an integer value from the input, but it is always 1 according to the initial state.
- The `nodes` dictionary and `start` integer remain unchanged from their initial states.
