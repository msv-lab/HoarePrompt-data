Output State: **`n` and `t` are updated with the values from `input().split()`, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, and `nodes` is now a defaultdict(list).**

The initial state is updated such that `nodes` is now a `defaultdict(list)`, which means it will automatically create a list for any new key that is accessed. The values of `n`, `t`, `start`, `edges`, and `empty` remain unchanged.
