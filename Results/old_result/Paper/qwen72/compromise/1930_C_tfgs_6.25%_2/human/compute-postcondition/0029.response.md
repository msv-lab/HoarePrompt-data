The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust these.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of unique integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, sorted in descending order and must have at least 1 element
- `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a`
- `i` is greater than 0
- `adv` is the minimum value among `a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1`, `cnt`, and `counter[a[i - 1]]`
- `counter[a[i - 1]]` is updated to `counter[a[i - 1]] - adv`
- `cnt` is updated to `n - len(a) - adv`
- `ans` is a list containing the values `a[i - 1] - 1, a[i - 1] - 2, ..., a[i - 1] - adv, a[i]`
- `j` is set to `adv - 1`
- `counter[a[i]]` is decreased by 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the list `a` must still have at least one more element to process.
