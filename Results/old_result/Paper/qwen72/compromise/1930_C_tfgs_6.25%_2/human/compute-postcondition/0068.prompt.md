You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and after the loop, each `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1` for all 0 ≤ i < n.
    counter = Counter(a)
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, counter[a[i - 1]])
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            counter[a[i - 1]] -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n`, and these additional elements are the largest possible integers that can be inserted between the elements of `a` without violating the uniqueness and descending order.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + cnt`, and the last `cnt` elements of `ans` are each one less than the previous element, starting from the last element of the initial `ans` list.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: 5 4 3 2 1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers. The function processes the list `a` and returns a result based on the input values, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
