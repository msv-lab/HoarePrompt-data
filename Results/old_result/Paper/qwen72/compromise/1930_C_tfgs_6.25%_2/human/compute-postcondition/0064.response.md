Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1` and must be greater than 0, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 2`, and the last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`**

Explanation:
- The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. The new element is `ans[-1] - 1`, which is the last element of `ans` before the append operation, minus 1.
- The length of `ans` was initially `n + 1`. After appending a new element, the length of `ans` becomes `n + 2`.
- The last element of `ans` is now `ans[-1] - 1`, which is the value of the second-to-last element of `ans` before the append operation, minus 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
