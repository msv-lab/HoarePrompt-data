Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and after the loop, each `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1` for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is still the same input integer, and the list `a` still contains `n` integers. However, each element in the list `a` has been updated such that `a[i]` is increased by `i + 1`, where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`.
