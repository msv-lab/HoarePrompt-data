Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers sorted in descending order, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` but all values in `counter` are now 0, `cnt` is `cnt - 1`, `ans` is a list containing all elements from `a` and additional elements such that the total length of `ans` is `n + 1`, and the last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`.** 

The code `ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)` appends a new element to the list `ans`. This new element is one less than the previously last element of `ans`. The length of `ans` is now `n + 1`, and the last element of `ans` is `ans[-2] - 1`. The value of `cnt` is decremented by 1, and all other conditions remain unchanged.
