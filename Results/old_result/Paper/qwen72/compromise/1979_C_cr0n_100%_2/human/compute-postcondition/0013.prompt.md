You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 1 <= N <= 50, and vals is a list of N integers such that 2 <= vals[i] <= 20 for all 0 <= i < N.
def func_2():
    N = int(input().strip())
    vals = [int(r) for r in input().strip().split()]
    den = vals[0]
    for x in vals:
        den = func_1(den, x)
        
    #State: N remains the same, `vals` remains the same, and `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals`.
    vprod = [(den // r) for r in vals]
    den = den - sum(vprod)
    if (den <= 0) :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
        return
        #The program returns nothing.
    #State: N remains the same, `vals` remains the same, `den` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the integers in the list `vals` minus the sum of `vprod`, `vprod` is a list where each element is the result of the original `den` divided by the corresponding element in `vals`, and `den` is greater than 0.
    print(' '.join([str(x) for x in vprod]))
    #This is printed: " ".join([str(den // vals[i]) for i in range(len(vals))])
#Overall this is what the function does: The function performs some internal operations but does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns nothing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
