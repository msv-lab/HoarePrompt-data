The function `func_1` should accept parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The array `c` is a list of positive integers, and the number of queries `q` is a non-negative integer. Each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the array `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed `3 * 10^5`.

The function returns the results of the queries, where each result is based on the subarray `c[l_i-1:r_i]` (considering Python's 0-based indexing).

Functionality: **The function accepts an array `c` of positive integers, a non-negative integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of `q` queries, each a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)`. It returns a list of results for each query, where each result is based on the subarray `c[l_i-1:r_i]`.**
