Output State: **`n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of its original values, `c` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` starting from `b[0] = 0`.**
