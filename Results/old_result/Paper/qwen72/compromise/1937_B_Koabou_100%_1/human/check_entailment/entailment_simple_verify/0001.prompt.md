You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n[i] satisfies 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and a list of tuples, each containing two binary strings of length n[i] (representing the 2 \times n grid for each test case).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two binary strings `a[0]` and `a[1]`.
   - It initializes an empty list `s` to store the lexicographically smallest string and variables `x` and `y` to track the positions where the grasshopper might switch rows.

2. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program iterates through the first `n-1` columns to determine the optimal path.
   - If `a[0][i + 1]` is '0' and `a[1][i]` is '1', it updates `y` to `i`.
   - If `a[0][i + 1]` is '1' and `a[1][i]` is '0', it constructs the string `s` by concatenating the prefix of `a[0]` up to `i` and the suffix of `a[1]` starting from `i`, and sets `x` to `i`.
   - If no such position `i` is found, it constructs `s` by concatenating `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, and sets `x` to `n-1`.

3. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program initializes `t` to 1, which will be used to count the number of valid paths.
   - It then iterates from `y` to `x` to check if the substring `a[1][i:x]` matches the corresponding substring in `s`.
   - If a match is found, it updates `t` to `x - i + 1` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `s`.
   - It prints the number of paths `t`.

### Analysis:

- **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
  - The program correctly identifies the point where the grasshopper should switch rows to minimize the lexicographical order of the string.
  - It constructs the string `s` by taking the minimum value at each step, ensuring that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.

- **Counting the Number of Paths:**
  - The program attempts to count the number of valid paths by checking the substring match.
  - However, the logic for counting the number of paths is flawed. The variable `t` is set to `x - i + 1` when a match is found, but this does not correctly count the number of valid paths. The number of valid paths is determined by the number of ways the grasshopper can switch rows and still form the lexicographically smallest string.

### Correctness:

- **Lexicographically Smallest String:**
  - The program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string in most cases, but it may fail in edge cases where the optimal path is not straightforward.

- **Number of Paths:**
  - The program's logic for counting the number of paths is incorrect. It does not account for all possible valid paths that can form the lexicographically smallest string.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The program correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string in many cases but fails to accurately count the number of valid paths. The logic for counting paths needs to be revised to correctly handle all possible valid paths.
