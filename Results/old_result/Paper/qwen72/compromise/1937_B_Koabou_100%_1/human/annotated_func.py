#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (where each n[i] satisfies 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and a list of tuples, each containing two binary strings of length n[i] (representing the 2 \times n grid for each test case). The sum of all n[i] over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two binary strings that were input during the loop execution, and the other variables remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, the list `s` is either a modified combination of `a[0]` and `a[1]` or the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`, `x` is the index where the loop broke or `n-1` if it did not break, and `y` is the index where the condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was last met or 0 if it was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `y` remains unchanged, `t` is either `x - i + 1` if the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is met for some `i` in the range `y` to `x-1`, or `t` remains 1 if the condition is never met.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of the variable s as it was before the print statement was executed)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: - The value of `t` depends on whether the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]` is met for any `i` in the range `y` to `x-1`.
    #   - If the condition is met for some `i`, `t` will be `x - i + 1`.
    #   - If the condition is never met, `t` will be 1.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `a`, `s`, `x`, and `y` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `t`. However, based on the given conditions, the print statement will output the value of `t` as described.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the user. It then processes these strings to determine a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified string `s` is derived by potentially combining parts of the two input strings based on specific conditions. The integer `t` is calculated based on the alignment of a substring from the second input string with a substring from the modified string `s`. Finally, the function prints the modified string `s` and the integer `t`. The function does not return any values.
