Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum of `x` and `y` followed by the maximum of `x` and `y`. The logic for determining the minimum and maximum values is correct, and the program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
