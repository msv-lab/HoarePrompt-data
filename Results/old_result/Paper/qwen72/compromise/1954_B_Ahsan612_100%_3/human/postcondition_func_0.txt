The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `a` that consists of the same integer. If no such subarray exists or if the entire array consists of the same integer, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the minimum length found.
