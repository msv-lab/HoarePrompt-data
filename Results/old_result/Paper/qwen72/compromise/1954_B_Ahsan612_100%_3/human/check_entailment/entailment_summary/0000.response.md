Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem by identifying the shortest contiguous subarray of identical elements in the given beautiful array. If the shortest such subarray is the entire array or does not exist, the program outputs `-1`. Otherwise, it outputs the length of the shortest subarray.

However, there are a few issues with the program's logic:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `same` and `minn`:**
   - The program increments `i` by 1 in every iteration, which means it does not properly handle the case where `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. This can lead to incorrect values of `same` and `minn`.
   - The program should increment `i` only once per iteration to correctly count the length of contiguous subarrays of the same element.

2. **Handling of Contiguous Subarrays:**
   - The program should correctly identify the minimum length of a contiguous subarray that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful. The current logic does not correctly handle this, especially when the array has multiple different elements.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle the case where the array has only one element or all elements are the same. In these cases, the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements, and the output should be `-1`.

Let's correct the program to properly handle these issues:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if all(x == ar[0] for x in ar):
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray that can be removed
        minn = float('inf')
        i = 0
        while i < len(ar):
            same = 1
            while i + 1 < len(ar) and ar[i] == ar[i + 1]:
                same += 1
                i += 1
            if i + 1 < len(ar) and ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                minn = min(minn, same)
            i += 1
        
        # If no such subarray exists, or the entire array is the same, output -1
        if minn == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check if All Elements are the Same:**
   - The program first checks if all elements in the array are the same using a generator expression inside the `all` function. If they are, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case.

2. **Find the Minimum Length of a Contiguous Subarray:**
   - The program iterates through the array to find the length of contiguous subarrays of the same element.
   - It uses a nested while loop to count the length of each contiguous subarray.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is part of a subarray where `ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]`, it updates `minn` with the length of this subarray.

3. **Output the Result:**
   - If `minn` remains `inf` after processing the array, it means no such subarray exists, and the program prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum length found.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the original program and the corrected logic, the original program is **incorrect**. The corrected program should be used to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
