### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array so that it is no longer beautiful.
   - A beautiful array allows operations where an element at index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) can be replaced by `a[i-1]` if `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`.
   - If it is impossible to make the array not beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It iterates through the array to find the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of the same integer.
   - If the entire array consists of the same integer, `minn` will be `inf` or equal to `len(ar)`, and the program will print `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the minimum length found.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the case where the array is not entirely the same but can still be made beautiful by removing elements.
   - The logic to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray of the same integer is flawed. It should also consider the possibility of making the array not beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program does not check if the array can be made not beautiful by removing elements, which is a crucial part of the problem.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - To make the array not beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) such that `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced by `a[i-1]`.
   - The program should check if removing the minimum number of elements can break this condition.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the array `[2, 2, 2]`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because the array is entirely the same.
   - For the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program correctly outputs `1` because removing the last element makes the array not beautiful.
   - For the array `[1]`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because the array is too short to be beautiful.
   - For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the program correctly outputs `3` because removing the first three elements makes the array not beautiful.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic for making the array not beautiful by removing elements.
   - The program only checks for the minimum length of contiguous subarrays of the same integer, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

### Correctness: **False**
