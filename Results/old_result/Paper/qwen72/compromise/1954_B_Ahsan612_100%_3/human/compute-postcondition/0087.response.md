The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `ar`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the length of `ar`. If `i` is less than the length of `ar`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1, and `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements. Given that `ar` has at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` is at least 2. Therefore, `i` being 1 and `len(ar)` being at least 2 ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`**
