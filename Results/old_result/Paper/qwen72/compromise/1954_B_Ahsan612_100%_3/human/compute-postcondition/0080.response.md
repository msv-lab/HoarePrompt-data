The loop head in the given task is:
```
for _ in range(int(input())):
```
This loop iterates a fixed number of times determined by the value of `int(input())`, which is read from user input at the start of the loop. The loop variable `_` is not used within the loop body, and the loop does not depend on any other variables or conditions to determine its continuation.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements
- `i` is `len(ar)`
- `num` is the last integer in `ar`
- `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`
- `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`

The only object in the loop head is the range object created by `range(int(input()))`. The loop variable `_` is not relevant to the state of the program and does not need to be adjusted.

Since the loop is controlled by the number of iterations specified by `int(input())`, the state of the program at the start of the next iteration does not change in terms of the variables mentioned in the loop head. The loop will execute the next iteration if there are more iterations left in the range specified by the user input.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration remains the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration, except for the loop variable `_` which is not relevant to the state.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is `len(ar)`, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, `same` is the count of the last sequence of consecutive identical integers in `ar`, and `minn` is the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. If `minn` was initially `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`, `minn` is updated to the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`. Otherwise, `minn` remains the minimum of the previous `minn` and `same`, and it is neither `inf` nor equal to the length of `ar`.**
