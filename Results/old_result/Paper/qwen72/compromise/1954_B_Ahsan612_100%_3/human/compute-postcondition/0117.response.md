The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `-1`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state.

Let's break down the initial state to ensure clarity:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.
- `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is `len(ar)`, which is the length of the list `ar`.
- `num` is the last integer in `ar`.
- `same` is the count of consecutive occurrences of the last integer in `ar`.
- `minn` is the minimum value between the original `minn` and `same`, and `minn` is either `inf` or equal to the length of `ar`.

However, none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement, which simply prints `-1`.

Output: **-1**
