The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The specific value of `i` before the increment depends on the conditions provided in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, then `i` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 5, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
