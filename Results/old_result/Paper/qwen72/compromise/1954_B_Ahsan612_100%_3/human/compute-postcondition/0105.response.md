To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the loop head, which is `i < len(ar)`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `ar`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 5
- `len(ar)` must be greater than 3

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(ar)`. Since `i` is 5, `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 to satisfy the condition `i < len(ar)`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `len(ar)` is greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5. If `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, then `i` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 3, and `minn` is `inf`. Otherwise, if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, then `i` is 4, `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `same` is 2, and `minn` is 1. If `ar[i]` is not equal to `num`, then `i` is 5, `num` is the fourth integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, and `minn` is 1.**
