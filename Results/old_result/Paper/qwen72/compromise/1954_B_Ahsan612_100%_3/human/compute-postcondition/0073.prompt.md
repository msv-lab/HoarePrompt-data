Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is 1, `num` is the first integer in `ar`, `same` is 1, `minn` is `inf`.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(ar):
    if ar[i] == num:
        same += 1
    else:
        i += 1
        num = ar[i]
        minn = min(minn, same)
        same = 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `i` is 3. `num` is the first integer in `ar` if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`. `same` is 2 if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `same` is 1. `minn` is `inf` if the second element of `ar` is equal to the first element of `ar`, otherwise `minn` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `num` is the first or second integer in `ar` depending on the initial conditions, `same` is 1, 2, or 3 depending on the initial conditions, `minn` is 1 or `inf` depending on the initial conditions, `i` is 3, 4, or 5 depending on the initial conditions.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 5, 6, or 7 depending on the initial conditions, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3, `num` is the first or second integer in `ar` if `ar[i] == num`, otherwise `num` is the integer at index `i` in `ar`, `same` is 2, 3, or 4 if `ar[i] == num`, otherwise `same` is 1, `minn` is 1 or `inf` depending on the initial conditions, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 6.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
