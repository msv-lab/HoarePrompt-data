Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is equal to `len(ar)`, `minn` is the minimum length of any contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer, `num` is the last integer in `ar`, and `same` is the length of the last contiguous subarray of `ar` that consists of the same integer. The current value of `minn` is either `inf` or `len(ar)`.**
