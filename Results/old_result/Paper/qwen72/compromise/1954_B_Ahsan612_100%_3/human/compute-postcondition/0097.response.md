The variables in the loop head are `i` and `len(ar)`, so we can only adjust these. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than the length of the list `ar`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, depending on the condition that `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ar`. Therefore, `len(ar)` must be greater than `i`.

Given that `i` is 2 or 3, `len(ar)` must be greater than 3 to ensure the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `i` is 3, `num` is the first integer in `ar` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `num` is the second integer in `ar`, `same` is 2 if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `same` is 1, and `minn` is `inf` if `ar[1]` is equal to the first integer in `ar`, otherwise `minn` is 1, and `len(ar)` must be greater than 3**
