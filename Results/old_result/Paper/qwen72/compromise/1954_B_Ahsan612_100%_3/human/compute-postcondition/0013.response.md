Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `ar` is a list of integers input by the user, `same` is 1, `num` is equal to `ar[2]`, `minn` is 1, `i` is 2, and `ar[i]` is not equal to the previous value of `num`.**

Explanation:
- `minn` was initially set to infinity.
- `same` is 1.
- The code `minn = min(minn, same)` updates `minn` to the minimum of its current value (infinity) and the value of `same` (1).
- Since 1 is less than infinity, `minn` is updated to 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
