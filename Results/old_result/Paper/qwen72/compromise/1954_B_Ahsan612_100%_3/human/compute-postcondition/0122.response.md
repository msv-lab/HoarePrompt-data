The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function operates on inputs `t`, `n`, and `a`, where:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful.

The function returns a result based on the processing of these inputs. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the output, but it is implied that the function processes the list `a` for each test case `t` and returns a result that is specific to the problem being solved.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers of length `n`, and returns a result for each test case.**
