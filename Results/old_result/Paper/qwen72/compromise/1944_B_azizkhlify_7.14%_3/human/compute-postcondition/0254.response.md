Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is now `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1, `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
