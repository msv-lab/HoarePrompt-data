Postcondition: ***`res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0). `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is greater than 0. If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2; otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.***
