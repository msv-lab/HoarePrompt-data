Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0).
- `i` is `n`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
- `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
- The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - According to the initial state, `i` is equal to `n`, and `n` is greater than 0. This means `i` is a positive integer.

2. **Variable `a[i]`**:
   - `a` is a list, and `i` is an index into this list. Since `i` is equal to `n` and `n` is greater than 0, `a[i]` refers to the element at index `n` in the list `a`.

3. **Condition `r[a[i] - 1]`**:
   - The current value of `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2. This means that the element at index `a[i] - 1` in the list `r` is 2. This condition is given and does not affect the value of `a[i]` directly.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The `print` statement will print the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
- Since `i` is `n` and `n` is greater than 0, `a[i]` is a valid element in the list `a`.
- The value of `a[i]` is not explicitly given, but it is an element of the list `a` at index `n`.
- The `print` statement will print this value twice, followed by a space.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[n] a[n] (where a[n] is the element at index n in the list a)**
