Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is now `2 * k - ul`, `i` is `n` (the loop has completed all iterations), `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1 and were added to `res` before `re` reached `k`, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2, `ur` is 0, and `res` is a list containing the elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k`, if `k` is not 0. If `k` is 0, `re` is 0 and `res` remains an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in res:
    print(i, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0), `i` is the first element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0), `i` is the second element in `res`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0), `i` is the third element in `res`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
