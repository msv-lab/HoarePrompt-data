Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `res` is a non-empty list.
2. **Variable `i`**: `i` is the first element of the list `res`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print(i, end=' ')
```

- The `print` statement will print the value of `i`.
- The `end=' '` parameter ensures that the output is followed by a space instead of a newline.

Since `i` is the first element of the list `res`, and `res` is non-empty, `i` will have a specific value that is the first element of `res`.

Output: **[i] (where i is the first element of the list res)**
