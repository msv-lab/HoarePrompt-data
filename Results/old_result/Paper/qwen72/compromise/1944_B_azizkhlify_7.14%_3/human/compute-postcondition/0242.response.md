Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is the new input integer, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ur` is 0, `res` is an empty list. If `ul` is equal to `k * 2`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken, and `ul` remains 0. Otherwise, `ul` is not equal to `k * 2` and the program continues.***
