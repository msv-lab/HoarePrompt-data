To determine what will be printed by the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement, let's break down the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
   - `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 2.
   - `k` is defined as `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1.
   - `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1.
   - `re` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 1.
   - `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2.
   - `ur` is 0.
   - `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the second element of `a`.
   - If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

2. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to the third element of the list `a`.
   - The `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the third element of `a` followed by a space.

3. **Explanation of Variables:**
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the input.
   - `i` is 2, so `a[i]` is the third element of `a`.

Given the initial state and the conditions, the `print(a[i], end=' ')` statement will print the third element of the list `a` followed by a space.

Output: **a[2] (where a[2] is the third element of the list a)**
