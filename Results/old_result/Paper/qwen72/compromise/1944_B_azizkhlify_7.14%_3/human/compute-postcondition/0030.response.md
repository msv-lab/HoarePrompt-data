To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `ul` remains unchanged unless specified conditions are met.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**: The value of `i` is 1.
2. **List `a`**: The list `a` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, we can infer that `a` must have at least two elements to avoid an `IndexError`.
3. **Accessing `a[i]`**: Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` refers to the second element of the list `a`.

### What is Printed:
- The `print` statement will print the value of `a[1]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

Since the exact values of `a[1]` are not provided, we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **a[1] a[1] (where a[1] is the second element of the list `a`)**
