Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0).
   - `i` is `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than 0.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur`.
   - If `ul` is equal to `ur`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1]` is 2, `ur` is increased by 2. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is defined as `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than 0. This means `i` is at least 3 (since `n` is greater than 0, the smallest value `n` can take is 1, making `i` at least 3).
   - The print statement prints the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Determining `a[i]`:**
   - The value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the index `i`.
   - Since `i` is `n + 2` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 3.
   - The exact value of `a[i]` is not provided in the initial state, so we can only describe it in terms of the list `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.
   - Since the exact value of `a[i]` is not known, we describe it as the element at index `n + 2` in the list `a`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index n + 2 in the list a)**
