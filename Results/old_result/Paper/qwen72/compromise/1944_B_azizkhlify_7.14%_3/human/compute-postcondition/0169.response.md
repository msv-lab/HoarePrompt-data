Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers, `n` is at least 1, `k` is the current value of `2 * k - ul`. If `k` is non-zero, `res` is a list containing the first `k` elements of `a` that appear exactly once in the first `n` elements of `a`, `i` is the index of the last element of `a` that was processed (or `n` if the loop completed without breaking), `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[n] - 1]`, `r[a[n + 1] - 1]`, ..., `r[a[2 * n - 1] - 1]` which are each incremented by 1, `re` is the number of elements added to `res` (which is `k` if the loop broke early or the number of unique elements in the first `n` elements of `a` if the loop completed), `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ur` is 0. If `k` is zero, `res` remains an empty list, `i` remains `n`, `l` and `r` retain their initial states, `re` remains 0, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that appear exactly twice in the first `n` elements of `a`, and `ur` is 0.***
