Postcondition: ***`res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`. `i` is `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 0. `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless `ul == ur` was true before the if statement. If `ul == ur`, the loop or if statement that the `break` statement was inside has been exited, and `ur` remains unchanged. Otherwise, if `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is `ur + 2`.***
