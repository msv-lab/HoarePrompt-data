Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is now `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0, `i` is `n` (the loop has completed all iterations), `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1, `re` is 0, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2, `ur` is 0, and `res` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l[a[i] - 1] == 1:
        print(a[i], end=' ')
        re += 1
        res.append(a[i])
    if re == k:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 0, `k` is now `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1, `re` is 1 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 0, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` remains an empty list. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 1, `k` is now `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1, `re` is 2 if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `re` remains 1, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the second element of `a`. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the input, `n` is a new input integer that must be greater than 2, `k` is now `2 * k - ul` and `k` is not 0, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of length `n` where each element at index `a[j] - 1` (for `j` in `0` to `n-1`) is incremented by 1, `r` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to 0 except `r[a[j] - 1]` for `j` in `n` to `2 * n - 1` which are incremented by 1, `ul` is the number of elements in `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`) that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 2, `ur` is 0, `res` is a list containing the first element of `a` if `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, otherwise `res` is a list containing the second element of `a`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is 1, `re` is 3 and the third element of `res` is `a[2]`. If `l[a[i] - 1]` is not 1, `re` remains 2. If `re` is equal to `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
