Output State: **`a` is a list of integers of length 2n where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is now a list of integers provided by the user, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of `n` zeros, `r` is a list of `n` zeros, `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are all 0.** 

The variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` have been initialized to 0, and the initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.
