Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`.
   - `i` is `n + 2`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless `ul == ur` was true before the if statement.
   - If `ul == ur`, the loop or if statement that the `break` statement was inside has been exited.
   - If `r[a[i] - 1] == 2`, then `ur` is `ur + 2`. Otherwise, `ur` remains unchanged.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is set to `n + 2`, where `n` is greater than 0. This means `i` is at least 2.
   - The print statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

4. **Determine the Value of `a[i]`:**
   - Since `i` is `n + 2` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` is at least 2.
   - The exact value of `a[i]` depends on the list `a` and the value of `n`. However, we know that `a[i]` is the element at index `n + 2` of the list `a`.

5. **Output:**
   - The print statement will output the value of `a[i]` twice, followed by a space.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:
Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index n + 2 of the list a)**
