The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `res`. The loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `res` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was the first element in `res`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be the second element in `res`.

State: **`res` is a non-empty list containing elements from `a` that caused `l[a[j] - 1]` to be 1, up to the point where `re` reached `k` (if `k` is not 0), `i` is the second element in `res`**
