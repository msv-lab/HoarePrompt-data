The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.**
