Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `res` is a list with elements that satisfied the condition `l[a[i] - 1] == 1` up to the point where `re` equals `k` or the loop has iterated through all elements of `a`.
2. `i` is `n + 1`, and `n` must be greater than 0.
3. `ul` is not equal to `ur` unless `ul == ur` was true before the if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is defined as `n + 1`.
   - Since `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 2 (if `n` is 1).

2. **List `a`**:
   - The list `a` is referenced in the print statement, but its exact contents are not provided in the initial state.
   - However, we know that `i` is an index into the list `a`.

3. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement `print(a[i], a[i], end=' ')` will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space (due to `end=' '`).

### Conclusion:
Given that `i` is `n + 1` and `n` is greater than 0, `i` will be at least 2. Therefore, the print statement will print the element at index `i` of the list `a` twice, followed by a space.

Since the exact contents of `a` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the value at index `i` of `a`.

Output: **a[i] a[i] (where a[i] is the element at index i of the list a, and i is n + 1, with n > 0)**
