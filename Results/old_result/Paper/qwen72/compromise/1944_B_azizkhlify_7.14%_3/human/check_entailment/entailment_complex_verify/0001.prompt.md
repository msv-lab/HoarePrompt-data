You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the final state of the variables is as follows:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of integers of length 2n, where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice, and an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. It prints pairs of integers from the list `a` that appear twice, up to `k` pairs. If the number of pairs printed is less than `k`, it prints additional integers that appear only once, up to the remaining count needed to reach `k` pairs. Finally, it prints any remaining integers from the list `a` that were not printed in the first part. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Counting Elements in Subarrays:**
   - The program initializes two lists `l` and `r` of length `n` to count the occurrences of each element in the first half and the second half of the array `a`, respectively.
   - It iterates over the first half of `a` and increments the count in `l` for each element.
   - It iterates over the second half of `a` and increments the count in `r` for each element.

3. **Constructing the Subarrays:**
   - The program initializes `re`, `ul`, and `ur` to 0. `re` is used to count the elements in the second half, `ul` and `ur` are used to count the elements in the first and second subarrays `l` and `r`, respectively.
   - It iterates over the first half of `a` to find elements that appear twice in the first half and prints them. This ensures that the first subarray `l` is constructed with elements from the first half of `a`.
   - It then checks if the required number of elements `2k` has been added to `l`. If not, it continues to find elements that appear once in the first half and prints them, adding them to `res`.

4. **Printing the First Subarray:**
   - The program prints the elements of the first subarray `l`.

5. **Constructing the Second Subarray:**
   - The program initializes `k` to `2k - ul` to account for the remaining elements needed for the second subarray `r`.
   - It iterates over the elements in `res` and prints them, ensuring that the second subarray `r` is constructed with elements from the first half that were not used in `l`.
   - If `ul` is not equal to `ur`, it iterates over the second half of `a` to find elements that appear twice and prints them, ensuring that the second subarray `r` is constructed with elements from the second half of `a`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of the second subarray `r`.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Incorrect Counting and Subarray Construction:**
  - The program incorrectly uses the same index `a[i] - 1` to count elements in both `l` and `r`. This is not necessary and can lead to incorrect counts.
  - The program does not correctly ensure that the elements in `l` and `r` are subsets of the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
  - The program does not correctly handle the construction of `r` when `ul` is not equal to `ur`.

- **Logical Errors:**
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than the number of elements that can be found in the first half of `a` that appear twice.
  - The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than the number of elements that can be found in the second half of `a` that appear twice.

### Correctness:
Given the issues and logical errors in the program, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
