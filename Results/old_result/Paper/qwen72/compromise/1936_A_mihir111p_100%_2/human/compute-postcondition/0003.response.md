Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each less than `n` (where 2 <= n <= 10^4). It prints a query string in the format `? [a] [b] [c] [d]` and then returns the user's input as a string. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the user's input is returned, and the original parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. **
