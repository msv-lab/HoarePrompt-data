Based on the initial state provided, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are non-negative integers such that \(0 \leq a, b, c, d < n\), and `n` is an integer with \(2 \leq n \leq 10^4\).

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```python
print('?', a, b, c, d)
```

This statement will print the string `'?'` followed by the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, each separated by a space.

Since the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are not specified, we can only describe them based on the given constraints. Each of these variables is a non-negative integer less than `n`.

Output: **? [a] [b] [c] [d] (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is an integer with 2 <= n <= 10^4)**
