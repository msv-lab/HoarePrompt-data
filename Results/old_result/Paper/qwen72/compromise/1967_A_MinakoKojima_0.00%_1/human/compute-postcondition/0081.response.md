Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers greater than 0, `_` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `m` is the smallest integer in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, `ans` is the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is the product of the differences between consecutive elements of `a` from `a[1] - a[0]` to `a[n-1] - a[n-2]`.***
