The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop condition to hold true.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `ans` is updated to `ans * (a[2] - a[1])`**
