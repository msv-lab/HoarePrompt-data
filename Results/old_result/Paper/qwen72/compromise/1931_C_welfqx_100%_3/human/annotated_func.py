#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    #State: For each test case, the output is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `num` to make it a palindrome.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values for `t` test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `num`. For each test case, it calculates and prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from `num` to make it a palindrome. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case.
