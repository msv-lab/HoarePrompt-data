The only variables in the loop head are `ii` and `n`. To ensure the loop executes, `n - 1` must be greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n - 2` and `n` is greater than 1. However, `i` is not used in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The variable `ii` will start at 0, and `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is `n - 2`, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is 0**
