The value of `cn` is incremented by the value of `ck`. The initial state specifies that `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`, or `n - 1` if all elements in `onum` are equal. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the end of `num` that are equal, up to `n - 1`. If all elements in `onum` are equal, `ck` is `n - 1`. The current values of `symb1` and `symb2` are equal, and `cn` is increased by `ck`.**
