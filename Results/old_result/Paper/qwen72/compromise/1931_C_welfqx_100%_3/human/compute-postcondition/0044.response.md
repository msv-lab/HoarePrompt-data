Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ (or `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking), `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`, `i` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `i` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal, and `ck` is 1.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`, `r`, `n`, `f`, `num`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`, `ck`**: These variables remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- **`i`**: This variable is the loop counter. After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 2` if the loop runs to completion without breaking. If the loop breaks early, `i` will be the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ.
- **`cn`**: This variable counts the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal. If the loop runs to completion without breaking, `cn` will be `n - 1` (since the loop iterates from 0 to `n - 2`). If the loop breaks early, `cn` will be the number of consecutive elements that were equal up to the point of breaking.
- **`j`**: This variable is set to the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ. If the loop completes without breaking, `j` will be `n - 2`. If the loop breaks early, `j` will be the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ.
