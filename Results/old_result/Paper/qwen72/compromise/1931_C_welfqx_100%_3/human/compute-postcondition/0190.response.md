Output State: **For each test case, the output is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the list `num` to make it a palindrome.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
For each test case, the loop processes a list of integers `num`. The loop first checks if all elements in `num` are the same or if the list has only one element. If either condition is true, it prints `0` because no elements need to be removed to make the list a palindrome. If the list has more than one element and not all elements are the same, the loop then calculates the number of consecutive elements from the start (`cn`) and the end (`ck`) of the list that are equal. If the first and last elements of the list are the same, `cn` is increased by `ck`. Finally, the loop prints the number of elements that need to be removed to make the list a palindrome, which is `n - max(cn, ck)`. This process is repeated for `t` test cases, and the output state after all iterations is the result of this calculation for each test case.
