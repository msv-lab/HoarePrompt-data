Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user.** 

The initial state remains unchanged for `t`, `r`, `n`, and `f`. The variable `num` is now a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the user's input, split by spaces.
