Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `ii` is `n - 2`.
   - `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is increased by `ck`. Otherwise, `cn` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(n - max(cn, ck))
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal. This means `ck` is a non-negative integer.
   - `cn` is a variable that is either unchanged or increased by `ck` depending on whether `symb1` equals `symb2`.
   - `max(cn, ck)` will return the larger of the two values, `cn` and `ck`.
   - The expression `n - max(cn, ck)` will subtract the maximum of `cn` and `ck` from `n`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is increased by `ck`, making `cn` at least as large as `ck`.
   - If `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`, then `cn` remains unchanged, and `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck` if `cn` is less than `ck`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, then `cn` is at least as large as `ck`, so `max(cn, ck)` will be `cn`. The output will be `n - cn`.
   - If `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`, then `cn` remains unchanged, and `max(cn, ck)` will be `ck` if `cn` is less than `ck`. The output will be `n - ck`.

Since the exact values of `cn` and `ck` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, we can describe the output based on the given conditions.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where `n` is greater than 1, `ck` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of `onum` that are equal, and `cn` is increased by `ck` if `symb1` equals `symb2`, otherwise `cn` remains unchanged)**
