The only variables in the loop head are `ii` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `ii` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 (specifically, `n` must be greater than 3 to ensure `ii` is within the range of `n - 1`).

State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 3**
