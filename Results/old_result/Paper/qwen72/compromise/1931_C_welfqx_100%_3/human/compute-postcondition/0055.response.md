The only objects in the loop head are variables `ii` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `ii` and the condition that `ii` must be less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `ii` must be incremented by 1, making `ii` equal to 2. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2 (since `ii` must be less than `n - 1`).

State: **`ii` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
