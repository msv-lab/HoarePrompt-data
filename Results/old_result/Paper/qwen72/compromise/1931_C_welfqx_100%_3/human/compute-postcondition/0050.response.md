Postcondition: ***`ii` is 0, `n` must be greater than 1. If the first element of `onum` is equal to the second element of `onum`, `ck` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the first element of `onum` is not equal to the second element of `onum`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
