Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is `n - 2` if the loop completes without breaking, otherwise `j` is the index where the first pair of consecutive elements differ, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `cn` is 1, `ck` is 1, `symb1` is the first element of `num`, `symb2` is the last element of `num`.**

Explanation:
- `symb2` is assigned the value of the first element of `onum`, which is a reversed copy of `num`. Therefore, `symb2` is the last element of `num`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
