Output State: **`onum` is a reversed copy of `num`, `ii` is `n - 2`, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1, `r` is `t - 1`, `t` is greater than `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `f` is 1, `j` is `n - 2`, `symb1` is the first character of `num`. If `n` is 1 or `f` is 1, the current iteration of the loop is skipped.**
