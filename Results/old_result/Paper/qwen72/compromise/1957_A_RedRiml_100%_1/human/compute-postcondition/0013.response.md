Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka`, `i` is the first element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary with the key `i` and its value is 1 if `d.get(i)` was None, otherwise the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.**
