The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `pl`. The loop will execute if `pl` is not empty. Given the state before the loop, we know that `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared. For the loop to execute, `pl` must contain at least one element. The state of `j` is not explicitly defined before the loop, but it will be set to the first element of `pl` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `pl` is not empty and `j` is the first element of `pl`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 2, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` and must have at least 1 element, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is 0, `j` is the first element of `pl`**
