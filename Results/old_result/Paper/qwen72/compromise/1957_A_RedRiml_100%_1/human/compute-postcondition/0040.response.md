To determine what will be printed by the `print(shapes)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. This represents the number of test cases.
   - `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case. This represents the number of elements in the list `palka`.
   - `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100. These are the elements of the list `palka`.
   - `w` is greater than 0. This variable is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `_` is 0. This variable is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `ln` is an input integer. This variable is not used in the given code snippet.
   - `palka` is a list of integers with `n` elements.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique integer from `palka` and the value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`.
   - `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka`.
   - `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.

2. **Calculation of `shapes`:**
   - For each unique integer `j` in the list `pl`, we check how many times it appears in `palka` using the dictionary `d`.
   - If `d[j]` (the count of `j` in `palka`) is at least 3, we compute `d[j] // 3` and add this value to `shapes`.
   - `shapes` is the total sum of these values for all such `j`.

3. **Output:**
   - The `print(shapes)` statement will print the total number of groups of 3 identical integers that can be formed from the list `palka`.

Since the exact values of `palka` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `shapes`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated number of such groups.

Output: **shapes (where shapes is the total number of groups of 3 identical integers that can be formed from the list `palka`)**
