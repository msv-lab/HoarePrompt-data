Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100; `w` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `pl` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in `palka`, and `d` is a dictionary. The current value of `i` is not in `pl`. If `d.get(i)` is None, `d` has the key `i` with the value 1. Otherwise, the value of `i` in `d` is incremented by 1.**
