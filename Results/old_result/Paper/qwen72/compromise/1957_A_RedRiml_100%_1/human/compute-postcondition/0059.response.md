Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user that must have at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `palka`, `d` is a dictionary with the first element of `palka` and `i` as keys. If `d.get(i)` was `None`, then `d[i]` is set to 1. Otherwise, `d[i]` is incremented by 1. `pl` is a list containing the first element of `palka` and `i` if `i` was not already in `pl`. `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `palka` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.**

Explanation:
- The code `pl.append(i)` adds the second element of `palka` to the list `pl`.
- If `i` was not already in `pl`, it is now included.
- The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
