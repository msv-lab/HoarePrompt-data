The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should work with an input that includes an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 100). The function should return a result based on these inputs.

Since the function definition does not include parameters, it is likely that these inputs are provided through some other means, such as global variables or user input within the function body.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, all within the range [1, 100]. It returns a result based on the input values for each test case.**
