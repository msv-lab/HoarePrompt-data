You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())

    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100, `w` is 0, `_` is `w-1`, `ln` is an input integer, `palka` is a list of integers input by the user, `pl` is a list containing all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `palka` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `palka`, `shapes` is the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, all within the range [1, 100]. It then calculates the number of groups of three identical integers that can be formed from the list and prints this number for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program includes `w` being 0, `_` being `w-1` (which is -1), `ln` being the last input integer, `palka` being the last list of integers input by the user, `pl` being a list of all unique integers from `palka` in the order they first appeared, `d` being a dictionary with counts of each integer in `palka`, and `shapes` being the sum of `d[j] // 3` for all elements `j` in `pl` that appear at least 3 times in `palka`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons with more than 3 sides. The logic in the program only checks if the count of sticks of a particular length is greater than or equal to 3 and then divides that count by 3 to determine the number of polygons. This approach is incorrect because it assumes that all polygons must have 3 sides (triangles), but the problem description allows for polygons with any number of sides (as long as they are regular and have at least 3 sides).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The expected output should be `2` because you can form two equilateral triangles (3 sides each) or one square (4 sides). However, the program will output `2` because it only considers the possibility of forming triangles, which is correct in this case but not optimal. The program fails to consider the possibility of forming polygons with more than 3 sides, leading to incorrect results in cases where forming larger polygons would yield a higher count of regular polygons.
