Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `i` is `n-1`, where `n` must be greater than 0.
2. `ii` is `n-2`.
3. `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached.
4. If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal plus `ck`.
5. Otherwise, `cn` remains the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal.
6. All other variables (`t`, `r`, `f`, `num`, `j`, `onum`, `symb1`, `symb2`) remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(n - max(cn, ck))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `n`**:
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.

2. **Determine `ck`**:
   - `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal up to the point where the elements are no longer equal or the end of the list is reached.
   - For example, if `onum = [1, 1, 1, 2, 3]`, then `ck` would be 3 (since the first three elements are equal).

3. **Determine `cn`**:
   - If `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal plus `ck`.
   - For example, if `num = [4, 4, 4, 5, 6]` and `ck = 3`, and `symb1 == symb2`, then `cn` would be 3 (count of consecutive elements from the start of `num`) + 3 (value of `ck`) = 6.
   - If `symb1` is not equal to `symb2`, `cn` is just the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal.
   - For example, if `num = [4, 4, 4, 5, 6]` and `symb1 != symb2`, then `cn` would be 3 (count of consecutive elements from the start of `num`).

4. **Determine `max(cn, ck)`**:
   - The `max` function will return the larger of `cn` and `ck`.
   - For example, if `ck = 3` and `cn = 6`, then `max(cn, ck) = 6`.
   - If `ck = 3` and `cn = 3`, then `max(cn, ck) = 3`.

5. **Determine `n - max(cn, ck)`**:
   - The final value to be printed is `n - max(cn, ck)`.
   - For example, if `n = 10` and `max(cn, ck) = 6`, then `n - max(cn, ck) = 10 - 6 = 4`.
   - If `n = 10` and `max(cn, ck) = 3`, then `n - max(cn, ck) = 10 - 3 = 7`.

### Final Output:
The code snippet `print(n - max(cn, ck))` will print the value of `n` minus the maximum of `cn` and `ck`. Since the exact values of `n`, `ck`, and `cn` depend on the specific lists `onum` and `num`, and the values of `symb1` and `symb2`, we can describe the output in general terms.

Output: **n - max(cn, ck) (where `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `ck` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `onum` that are equal, and `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal plus `ck` if `symb1` is equal to `symb2`, otherwise `cn` is just the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal)**
