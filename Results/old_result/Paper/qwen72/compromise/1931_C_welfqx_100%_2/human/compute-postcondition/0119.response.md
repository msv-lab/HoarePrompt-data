Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, `n` must be greater than 2, `ii` is 2, `ck` is `ck + 1`**

The value of `ck` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`i`, `cn`, `n`, `ii`) remain unchanged. The initial conditions (`i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, `n` must be greater than 2, `ii` is 2) are still valid.
