Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is the index of the first inequality found if the loop was broken, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of `num` (now reversed again to its original order), `symb1` is the first integer in the list `num`, `symb2` is the last integer in the list `num`, `i` is 0 if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `i` is `n-2`, `ii` is `n-1` if the first element of `num` is not equal to the second element of `num`, otherwise `ii` is the index of the last element checked in `onum` before the loop broke or completed, `ck` is 1, `cn` is 1.**

Explanation: The code snippet `symb1 = num[0]` assigns the first integer in the list `num` to the variable `symb1`. All other variables and their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects this assignment while keeping all other initial conditions intact.
