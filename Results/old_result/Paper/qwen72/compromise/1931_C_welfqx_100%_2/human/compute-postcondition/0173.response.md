Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is 0, `ck` is 2, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element, and the loop breaks at the first inequality if any. Additionally, the first two elements of `onum` are equal, i.e., `onum[0] == onum[1]`.**
