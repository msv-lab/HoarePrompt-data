The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `t`, `r`, `f`, and `num` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute. However, we need to ensure that `j` is set to 0 (the starting point of the loop) and `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `r` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `f` is 1, `num` is a list of integers provided by the user, `j` is 0**
