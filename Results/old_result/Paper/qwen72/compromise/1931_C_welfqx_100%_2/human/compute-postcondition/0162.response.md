The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than 1 to ensure `i` is less than `n - 1`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `ii` is `n-2`, `ck` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`. If `num[i]` is equal to `num[i + 1]`, `cn` is 2. Otherwise, `cn` is 1 and `num[i]` is not equal to `num[i + 1]`.**
