Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `cn` is the count of consecutive elements from the start of the list `num` that are equal, `n` must be greater than 1, `ii` is 0, `ck` is `ck + 1`, and the first two elements of `onum` are equal.**

The value of `ck` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The initial state conditions are still valid, including the values of `i`, `cn`, `n`, `ii`, and the fact that the first two elements of `onum` are equal.
