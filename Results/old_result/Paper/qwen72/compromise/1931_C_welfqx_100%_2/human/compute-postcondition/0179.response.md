Output State: **`i` is `n-2`, `n` is greater than 2, `ii` is 1, `r` is `r+1`, `t` is greater than `r+1`, `f` is 1, `j` is the index where the first inequality is found if the loop breaks, otherwise `j` is `n-2`, `onum` is a reversed copy of the list `num`, `symb1` is the first element of the list `num`, `symb2` is the last element of the list `num`, `cn` is the number of consecutive elements from the start of the list that are equal to their next element, and the loop breaks at the first inequality if any, `ck` is 2 if `onum[0] == onum[1]`, otherwise `ck` is 1 and the loop breaks.** 

The `break` statement causes the program to exit the loop it is currently in. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the loop is terminated.
