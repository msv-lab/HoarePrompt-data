### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `num`.
   - This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Initial Check for All Elements Being Equal**:
   - The function checks if all elements in the array are already equal by iterating through the array and comparing each element with the next one.
   - If all elements are equal or the array has only one element, the cost is `0` because no operation is needed. This is correct.
   - The initial check is well-handled.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The function creates a reversed copy of the array `onum` to handle the scenario where the same value might be present at both ends of the array.
   - This is a valid approach to check for consecutive equal elements from the end of the array.

4. **Counting Consecutive Equal Elements from the Start and End**:
   - The function counts the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the beginning of the array (`cn`).
   - It also counts the number of consecutive equal elements starting from the end of the array (`ck`).
   - This is correctly implemented.

5. **Combining Counts**:
   - If the first element of the original array (`symb1`) is equal to the first element of the reversed array (`symb2`), it adds the counts `cn` and `ck` to get the total number of consecutive equal elements from both ends.
   - This part is also correctly implemented.

6. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The function prints the minimum cost as `n - max(cn, ck)`. This is based on the idea that the minimum cost to make all elements equal is the length of the array minus the maximum number of consecutive equal elements from either the start or the end.
   - This logic is correct for the given problem.

### Analysis:
- The approach is to find the longest segment of consecutive equal elements from either the start or the end of the array and then use the operation to make the rest of the array equal to this segment.
- If the first and last elements are the same, it combines the counts from both ends to maximize the segment of equal elements.
- The cost is calculated as the length of the array minus the length of the longest segment of equal elements.

### Edge Cases:
- **All Elements Equal**: The function correctly handles this case by printing `0`.
- **Single Element Array**: The function correctly handles this case by printing `0`.
- **No Consecutive Equal Elements**: The function will correctly calculate the cost as `n - 1` because the longest segment of equal elements will be of length `1`.

### Additional Considerations:
- The function does not handle the case where the array has multiple segments of equal elements that are not at the start or end. However, the problem description does not require this, and the function's approach is sufficient to find the minimum cost.
- The function's logic is consistent with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
