Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, `n` must be at least 2 if even or at least 3 if odd, `pattern` is `['B', 'A', 'A', 'A']` if `n` is even, `pattern` is `['B', 'A', 'B', 'B']` if `n` is odd, `i` is `n // 2`.**

Explanation:
- `i` is `n // 2`.
- `i % 2` gives the remainder when `i` is divided by 2.
- `i % 2 ^ 1` toggles the value of `i % 2` between 0 and 1.
- `'AB'[i % 2 ^ 1]` selects either 'A' or 'B' based on the toggled value.
- If `n` is even, `i` is an integer and `i % 2` is 0, so `i % 2 ^ 1` is 1, and `'AB'[1]` is 'B'. However, the initial `pattern` for even `n` is `['B', 'A', 'A']`, so the appended value is 'A'.
- If `n` is odd, `i` is an integer and `i % 2` is 1, so `i % 2 ^ 1` is 0, and `'AB'[0]` is 'A'. However, the initial `pattern` for odd `n` is `['B', 'A', 'B']`, so the appended value is 'B'.
- The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged.
- The value of `n` remains the same, and the condition for `n` being at least 2 if even or at least 3 if odd is still valid.
- The value of `i` remains `n // 2`.
