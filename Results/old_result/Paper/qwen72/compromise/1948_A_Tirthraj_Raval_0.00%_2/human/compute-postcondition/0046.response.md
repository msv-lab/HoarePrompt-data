Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is ['A', 'B', 'B'], `i` is 1**

Explanation: The code appends the character at index `i % 2` of the string 'AB' to the list `pattern`. Since `i` is 1, `i % 2` is 1, and the character at index 1 of 'AB' is 'B'. Therefore, 'B' is appended to `pattern`, making `pattern` ['A', 'B', 'B']. The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
