Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The function should generate a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters, where a special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The length of the generated string should be at most 200. If no such string can be generated, the function should return "NO". `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        pattern = []
        for i in range(n // 2):
            pattern.append('AB'[i % 2])
            pattern.append('AB'[i % 2 ^ 1])
        print(''.join(pattern))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 0, and `n` is an input integer. If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer, and `pattern` is a list of 'B', 'A' pairs repeated `n // 2` times. If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and if `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer. If `n` is even, `n` remains an even integer and `pattern` is a list of 'AB' pairs repeated `n // 2` times, and `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
