The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer, but it does not specify whether `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop, and it starts at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
