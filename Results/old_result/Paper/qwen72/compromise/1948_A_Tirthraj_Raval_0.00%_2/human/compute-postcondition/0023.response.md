Let's analyze the given initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `_` is 0.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `n` is odd, `n` remains an odd integer.
   - If `n` is even, `pattern` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'B', 'A' repeated `n // 4` times.
   - `i` is `n // 2 - 1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The print statement simply prints the string 'YES'.
   - The values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `pattern`, and `i` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the print statement does not reference any of these variables.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The print statement will always print 'YES' regardless of the values of the variables described in the initial state.

Output: **YES**
