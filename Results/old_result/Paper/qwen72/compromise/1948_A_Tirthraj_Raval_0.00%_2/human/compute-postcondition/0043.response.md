The code appends the character from the string 'AB' at the index `i % 2` to the list `pattern`. Since `i` is 0, `i % 2` is 0, so the character 'A' is appended to `pattern`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `pattern` is ['A'], `i` is 0**
