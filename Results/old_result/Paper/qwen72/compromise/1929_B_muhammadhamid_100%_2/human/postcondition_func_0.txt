The function processes multiple pairs of integers (n, k) provided through user input. For each pair, it calculates and prints a value based on the following rules: If k is 1, it prints 1. If k is less than or equal to 2 * (n + (n - 2)), it prints the ceiling of k divided by 2. Otherwise, it prints k divided by 2 plus 1. The function does not return any value; it only prints the calculated results for each input pair. After processing all input pairs, the function concludes, and the variables n and k do not retain any specific values.
