Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of cards left in the hand after performing the specified operations. The operations involve selecting `k` cards with the same number and exchanging them for `k-1` cards with any number. The key to solving this problem is to understand how the frequency of each card number affects the minimum number of cards that can remain.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - If `k > n`, it means there are not enough cards to perform any operation, so the minimum number of cards left is `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number in `nums`, but caps the frequency at `k` if a number appears more than `k` times. This is done to ensure that the frequency table reflects the maximum number of cards that can be used in a single operation.

4. **Final Output:**
   - The program checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`.
   - If such a card number exists, it prints `k - 1` because you can perform the operation once and be left with `k - 1` cards.
   - If no card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k`, it prints `n` as the final answer.

### Issues with the Program:
- **Incorrect Final Output Logic:**
  - The program's logic for determining the final output is flawed. It only checks if any card number has a frequency exactly equal to `k` and prints `k - 1` if so. However, this does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations or the optimal way to reduce the number of cards.
  - For example, in the fourth test case where `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the card number `1` appears 10 times. The program should be able to repeatedly perform the operation to reduce the number of cards to 3, but it does not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves calculating the minimum number of cards that cannot be grouped into sets of `k` cards. This can be done by:
  - Counting the frequency of each card number.
  - For each card number, calculating the remainder when the frequency is divided by `k`.
  - Summing these remainders to get the minimum number of cards that cannot be part of a complete set of `k` cards.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the optimal reduction of cards correctly. It only checks for a specific condition and does not account for the possibility of performing multiple operations to minimize the number of cards left.

Correctness: **False**
