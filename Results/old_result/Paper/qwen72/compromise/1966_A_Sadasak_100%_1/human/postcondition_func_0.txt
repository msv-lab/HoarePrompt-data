The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is an integer from `arr`, and the value is the frequency of that integer in `arr`, capped at `k` if the frequency exceeds `k`. The original list `arr` and the integer `k` are not modified by the function.
