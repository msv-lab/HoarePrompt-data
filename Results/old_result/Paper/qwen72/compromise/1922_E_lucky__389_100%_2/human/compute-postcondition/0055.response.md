Postcondition: ***`x` is an input integer and `x` is not 0. `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\). If `i` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `subseq_lens` is a list that includes the value `i - 1`, `x` is now equal to the original `x` minus \(2^{(i - 1)}\), and `mx` is the maximum of the original `mx` and `i - 1`.***
