The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the list `ansv`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `ansv`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `ansv` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, making `i` 2, and `ansv` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list of integers, `mx` is the maximum integer in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1` and the elements `subseq_lens[1]` through `subseq_lens[len(subseq_lens)-1]`, `i` is 2, `ansv` must have at least 2 elements**
