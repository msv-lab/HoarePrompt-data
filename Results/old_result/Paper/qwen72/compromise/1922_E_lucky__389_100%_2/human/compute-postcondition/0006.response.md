Output State: **The program returns -1.**

The function `func_1` is expected to return an array of integers that has exactly `X` increasing subsequences, where `X` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^18. Given that the current value of `x` is 2, the function should return an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. However, the provided code snippet simply returns without any logic to generate the required array. Since no such array is generated, the function returns -1, indicating that no such array exists.
