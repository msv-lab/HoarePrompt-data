The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** i <= x` must still be true after the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 4. To check if the loop can execute again, we need to evaluate the condition with the current value of `i`:

- Current `i` is 2, so `2 ** 2` is 4.
- `x` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to have executed up to this point.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment to 3, and the condition will be `2 ** 3 <= x`, which simplifies to `8 <= x`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, `x` must be greater than or equal to 8.

State: **`x` is an input integer and `x` must be greater than or equal to 8, `i` is 2**
