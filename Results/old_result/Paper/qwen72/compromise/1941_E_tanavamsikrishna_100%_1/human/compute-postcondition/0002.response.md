Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the values from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m, with the first and last columns having a depth of 0. `rows` is a list of `n` lists, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of the river grid. `costs` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`.**
