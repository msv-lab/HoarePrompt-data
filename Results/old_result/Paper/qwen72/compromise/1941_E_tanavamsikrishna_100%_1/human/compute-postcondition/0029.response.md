Output State: **The loop will continue to execute until the smallest index in `min_heap` is greater than `i - (d + 2)`. After all iterations, `i` will remain `d + k + 3`, `row` will still be a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` will remain unchanged, and `min_heap` will be a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` pushed back into the heap, and all indices in `min_heap` will be greater than `i - (d + 2)`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`.**
