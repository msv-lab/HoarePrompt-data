Output State: **`i` is `d + k + 3`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` remains unchanged, `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing the elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` pushed back into the heap.**

The `pass` statement does not change any of the variables or the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.
