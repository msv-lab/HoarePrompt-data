You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, but it reads input values for n, m, k, and d, where n is the number of rows in the river grid, m is the number of columns, k is the number of bridges to build, and d is the maximum distance between supports. It also reads n rows of m integers each, representing the depths of the river cells. The values are such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m, with the first and last columns having a depth of 0.
def func_2():
    n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
    rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
    costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
    total_costs = []
    for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
        total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, `i` is `len(costs) - k`, and `total_costs` is a list containing the sums of every contiguous subsequence of length `k` in `costs`.
    print(min(total_costs))
    #This is printed: min(total_costs) (where min(total_costs) is the minimum sum of any contiguous subsequence of length k in the costs list)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and a grid of river depths. It returns the minimum total depth of the river cells that need to be bridged to build `k` bridges, ensuring the distance between any two supports does not exceed `d`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
