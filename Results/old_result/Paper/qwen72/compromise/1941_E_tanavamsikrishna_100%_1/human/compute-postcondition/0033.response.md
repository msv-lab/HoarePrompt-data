To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's break down the loop condition and the state provided:

### Loop Condition:
```python
while (e := heappop(min_heap))[1] <= i - (d + 2):
```
- The loop will execute if the index of the tuple `e` (which is the first element of `min_heap` after it is popped) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### State Before the Loop:
- `i` is `d + k + 4`
- `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements
- `d` will remain unchanged
- `min_heap` is a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` and `(row[i], i)` pushed back into the heap
- All indices in `min_heap` will be greater than `i - (d + 2)`
- The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`
- The tuple `e` and the new tuple `(row[i], i)` are now included in `min_heap` and the heap is re-heapified

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`**:
   - `i` is `d + k + 4`.

2. **Variable `d`**:
   - `d` is unchanged and is part of the loop condition.

3. **Variable `min_heap`**:
   - `min_heap` contains tuples with indices greater than `i - (d + 2)`.
   - The first element of `min_heap` (i.e., `e`) must have an index that is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)` for the loop to execute.

### Adjustments Needed:
- The loop condition checks if the index of the tuple `e` (popped from `min_heap`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
- Given that all indices in `min_heap` are greater than `i - (d + 2)`, the loop will not execute unless we adjust the state of `min_heap` to include at least one tuple with an index less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Conclusion:
- To ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to adjust the state of `min_heap` so that the index of the tuple `e` (popped from `min_heap`) is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.

### Adjusted State:
- We need to ensure that the first element of `min_heap` has an index that is less than or equal to `i - (d + 2)`.
- Since `i` is `d + k + 4`, `i - (d + 2)` simplifies to `k + 2`.

Therefore, the state of `min_heap` should be adjusted to ensure that the first element of `min_heap` has an index less than or equal to `k + 2`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is `d + k + 4`, `row` is a list with at least `d + k + 1` elements, `d` will remain unchanged, and `min_heap` will be a heapified list of tuples containing elements and their indices from the first `d` elements of `row`, but with the first `k + 1` elements removed and `e` and `(row[i], i)` pushed back into the heap, and the first element of `min_heap` must have an index less than or equal to `k + 2`. The value of `row[i]` is updated to `e[0] + row[i] + 1`. The tuple `e` and the new tuple `(row[i], i)` are now included in `min_heap` and the heap is re-heapified.**
