### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each row must have supports installed at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell (i, j) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first column to 1 (since \(a_{i,1} = 0\), the cost is \(0 + 1 = 1\)).
   - It then iterates through the first d columns, setting the cost to \(a_{i,j} + 2\) (since the first column already has a support, the cost for the next d columns is \(a_{i,j} + 1 + 1 = a_{i,j} + 2\)).
   - A min-heap is used to keep track of the minimum cost of installing supports within the sliding window of size d.
   - For each cell from column d to the last column, it ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed d by removing elements from the heap that are too far away.
   - It then adds the minimum cost from the heap to the current cell's cost and pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last column, which is the total cost for the row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input values for n, m, k, and d.
   - It reads the grid of depths for n rows.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1(row, d)`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building k consecutive bridges by summing the costs of k consecutive rows.
   - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of k consecutive rows.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The input is read using `input().split(' ')` and converted to integers.
   - The output is printed using `print(min(total_costs))`.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints \(1 \le k \le n \le 100\) and \(3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns have supports by setting their costs appropriately.
   - The function uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost within the sliding window of size d.

6. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is \(O(m \log d)\) due to the heap operations.
   - The time complexity of `func_2` is \(O(n \cdot m \log d)\) for processing all rows and finding the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows.
   - The space complexity is \(O(m)\) for the heap and the row costs.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid. The use of a min-heap ensures efficient handling of the sliding window constraint, and the overall structure of the program aligns with the problem requirements.
