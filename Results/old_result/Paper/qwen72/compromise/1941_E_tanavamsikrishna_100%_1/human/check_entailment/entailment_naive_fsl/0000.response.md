Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a flaw in the implementation of `func_1`. Specifically, the way the minimum heap is managed and the way the costs are calculated for each cell does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. The issue arises from the incorrect handling of the heap and the calculation of the cost for each cell.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 2 0 2 0
0 3 0 3 0
```
For this input, the correct output should be `4` because the minimum cost to build a bridge with the maximum distance `d = 2` between supports is to build it on the first row, where the cost is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

However, the program will incorrectly calculate the cost for the first row as follows:
1. Initialize the first `d` elements: `row = [1, 3, 1, 1, 1]`.
2. For `i = 3` (the fourth element), the heap will contain `[(1, 0), (3, 1), (1, 2)]`.
3. The program will pop the minimum element `(1, 0)` and add `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` to the fourth element, resulting in `row = [1, 3, 1, 3, 1]`.
4. For `i = 4` (the fifth element), the heap will contain `[(3, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3)]`.
5. The program will pop the minimum element `(1, 2)` and add `1 + 1 + 1 = 3` to the fifth element, resulting in `row = [1, 3, 1, 3, 3]`.

The final cost for the first row is `3`, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `4`.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the condition that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
