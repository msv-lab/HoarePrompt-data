### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to find the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid.
   - Each row must have supports installed at the first and last columns, and the distance between any two adjacent supports must not exceed d.
   - The cost of installing a support in a cell (i, j) is \(a_{i,j} + 1\).

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - The function sets `row[0] = 1` to account for the cost of installing a support at the first column.
     - It then iterates through the first d columns, setting the cost to \(a_{i,j} + 2\) (since the first column already has a support, the cost for the next d columns is \(a_{i,j} + 1 + 1 = a_{i,j} + 2\)).
   - **Heap Initialization**:
     - A min-heap is created with the first d elements of the row, along with their indices.
   - **Sliding Window**:
     - For each cell from column d to the last column, it ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed d by removing elements from the heap that are too far away.
     - It then adds the minimum cost from the heap to the current cell's cost and pushes the updated cost back into the heap.
   - **Final Cost**:
     - The function returns the cost of the last column, which is the total cost for the row.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**:
   - **Input Reading**:
     - The function reads the input values for n, m, k, and d.
     - It reads the grid of depths for n rows.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1(row, d)`.
   - **Total Cost Calculation**:
     - It then calculates the total cost for building k consecutive bridges by summing the costs of k consecutive rows.
   - **Output**:
     - It prints the minimum total cost among all possible sets of k consecutive rows.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1**:
     - The initial state of `row` is correctly set with `row[0] = 1` and the first d columns are updated to `row[i] + 2`.
     - The min-heap is correctly initialized with the first d elements.
     - The loop from `d` to `len(row)` ensures that the distance between supports does not exceed d by removing elements from the heap that are too far away.
     - The cost for each cell is updated correctly by adding the minimum cost from the heap to the current cell's cost.
     - The final state of `row` is such that the last element contains the total cost for the row.
   - **Function 2**:
     - The input is read correctly and converted to integers.
     - The grid of depths is read correctly.
     - The costs for each row are calculated using `func_1(row, d)`.
     - The total costs for k consecutive rows are calculated and stored in `total_costs`.
     - The minimum total cost is printed correctly.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints \(1 \le k \le n \le 100\) and \(3 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The function ensures that the first and last columns have supports by setting their costs appropriately.
   - The function uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum cost within the sliding window of size d.

6. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is \(O(m \log d)\) due to the heap operations.
   - The time complexity of `func_2` is \(O(n \cdot m \log d)\) for processing all rows and finding the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows.
   - The space complexity is \(O(m)\) for the heap and the row costs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic for finding the minimum total cost of installing supports for k bridges on consecutive rows of a river grid. The use of a min-heap ensures efficient handling of the sliding window constraint, and the overall structure of the program aligns with the problem requirements.

Final: **True**
