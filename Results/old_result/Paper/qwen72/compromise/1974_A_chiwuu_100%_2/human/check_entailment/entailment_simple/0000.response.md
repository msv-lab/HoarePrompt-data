### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to the number of 2x2 icons (`b`).
   - The program then calculates the number of screens required to fit all the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can fit 2 2x2 icons (as a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells and a screen has 15 cells), the calculation is:
     - If `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`.
     - If `b` is odd, `t` is set to `b // 2 + 1`.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. This is done by `t * 15 - b * 4`, where `t * 15` is the total number of cells available on `t` screens, and `b * 4` is the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons.
   - This remaining space is stored in `t1`.

4. **Fitting 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space `t1` is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons `a`, then the current number of screens `t` is sufficient.
   - If the remaining space `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed to fit the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2` is the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed, calculated as `a - t1`.
     - If `t2` is a multiple of 15, then `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not a multiple of 15, then `t` is incremented by `t2 // 15 + 1` to account for the partial screen needed.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens `t` required for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of 2x2 Icon Calculation:**
  - The calculation for the number of screens required to fit 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can fit 2 2x2 icons, so the number of screens needed is `b // 2` if `b` is even, and `b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd.

- **Correctness of Remaining Space Calculation:**
  - The remaining space calculation is correct. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, so the remaining space is `t * 15 - b * 4`.

- **Correctness of 1x1 Icon Fitting:**
  - The logic for fitting the 1x1 icons is correct. If the remaining space is sufficient, no additional screens are needed. If not, the additional screens required are calculated correctly by dividing the remaining icons by 15 and adding 1 if there is a remainder.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to fit the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The logic and calculations are sound and match the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
