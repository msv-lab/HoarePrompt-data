The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k`. Here's the description of the functionality:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50.

Given these constraints, the function is expected to return a result based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case. However, the specific output based on these parameters is not provided in the problem statement.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `k` such that 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50. The function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.**
