Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from user input, where 1 <= m, k <= n <= 50. The function then checks if `n` is less than or equal to `k` or if `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than `k`. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes and does not return any value. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unchanged after the function concludes. **
