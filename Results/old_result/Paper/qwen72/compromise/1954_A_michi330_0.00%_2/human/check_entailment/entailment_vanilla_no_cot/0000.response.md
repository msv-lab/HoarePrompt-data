Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Logic**:
   - The condition `if n <= k` checks if Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon because he can repaint up to `k` parts, and if `k` is at least `n`, he can always make all parts the same color.
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` checks if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. Here's the reasoning:
     - `math.ceil(n / m)` calculates the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the same color if Alice uses all `m` colors optimally. This is because if Alice uses all `m` colors, the most balanced distribution would be to have `math.ceil(n / m)` parts of one color and the rest distributed among the other colors.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m)` gives the number of parts that are not painted with the most frequent color.
     - If this number is less than `k`, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Output**: The program prints 'NO' if either of the conditions is true, indicating that Bob can make all parts the same color. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

The logic and conditions used in the program are consistent with the problem requirements and correctly handle the given constraints and examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
