### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to try to make all parts the same color.
   - We need to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Conditions for Bob to Succeed:**
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts.
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can repaint all parts to the same color, regardless of how Alice paints them.
   - If `n > k`, Bob can only change `k` parts. Therefore, Alice needs to ensure that the number of parts that are not the same color is more than `k`.

3. **Conditions for Alice to Succeed:**
   - Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that the maximum number of parts of any single color is less than `n - k`.
   - This means that if Alice paints the ribbon such that no color appears more than `math.ceil(n / m)` times, Bob will not be able to repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `n <= k`: If the number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint, Bob can always make all parts the same color.
     - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition ensures that if the maximum number of parts of any single color is less than `n - k`, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

5. **Correctness of the Conditions:**
   - The first condition `n <= k` is correct because if Bob can repaint all parts, he will always succeed.
   - The second condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is correct because `math.ceil(n / m)` gives the minimum number of parts that can be painted with the same color if Alice distributes the colors as evenly as possible. If the number of parts that are not the same color is less than `k`, Bob can always repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color. The conditions used in the program are logically sound and match the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
