You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries, respectively, `c` is a list of positive integers, and `queries` is a list of lists, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n, and the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split(' '))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ones = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    sum = [(0) for i in range(n + 1)]
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
        
        sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1] - 1
        
    #State: `ones` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative count of 1s in the `nums` list from index 0 to `i-1`. `sum` is a list where each element at index `i` represents the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in the `nums` list from index 0 to `i-1` and 1. The values of `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
    for _ in range(q):
        l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
        
        if l == r:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
        
        sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
        
        if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The values of `ones`, `sum`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes a series of queries on an array of positive integers. It takes no parameters directly but reads input from the standard input. The function first reads two integers `n` and `q`, representing the length of the array and the number of queries, respectively. It then reads the array `nums` of length `n`. The function calculates two auxiliary arrays: `ones`, which tracks the cumulative count of 1s in `nums`, and `sum`, which tracks the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `nums` and 1. For each of the `q` queries, it reads a pair of integers `l` and `r` and determines if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) is satisfied, where `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are the counts and sums within the range `[l, r]` of `nums`. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `ones`, `sum`, `n`, `q`, `t`, `c`, and `queries` remain unchanged, but the function has printed the results of the queries to the standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `nums` and initializes two auxiliary arrays `ones` and `sum`.

2. **Auxiliary Arrays**:
   - `ones` is used to store the cumulative count of elements equal to 1 in the array `nums`.
   - `sum` is used to store the cumulative sum of `nums[i] - 1` for each element in the array `nums`.

3. **Preprocessing**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and updates the `ones` and `sum` arrays.
   - `ones[i]` is the number of 1s in the subarray `nums[0:i]`.
   - `sum[i]` is the sum of `nums[0:i] - 1`.

4. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be good because there is no way to replace the single element with a different positive integer while maintaining the same sum.
   - For other queries, it calculates the number of 1s in the subarray `c[l:r]` using `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`.
   - It also calculates the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray `c[l:r]` using `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`.

5. **Good Subarray Condition**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying the condition:
     - `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`
   - This condition can be simplified to:
     - `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`
   - This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `c[l:r]` can be split into a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `c`.

### Simplified Condition Explanation:
- `onesInRange` is the number of 1s in the subarray.
- `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` is the number of elements in the subarray that are not 1.
- `sumInRange` is the sum of `nums[i] - 1` for the subarray, which is the total sum of the subarray minus the number of elements in the subarray.
- The condition `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange` ensures that the sum of the subarray is large enough to allow for a different positive integer for each element.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, preprocesses the array, and checks the condition for each query. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
