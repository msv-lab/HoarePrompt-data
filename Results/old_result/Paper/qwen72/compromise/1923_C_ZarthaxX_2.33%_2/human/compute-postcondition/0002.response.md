Output State: **`n` and `q` are assigned the values from the input, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `c` is a list of positive integers, `queries` is a list of lists, each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` such that 1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n, and the sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 * 10^5. `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer. `ones` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0.**
