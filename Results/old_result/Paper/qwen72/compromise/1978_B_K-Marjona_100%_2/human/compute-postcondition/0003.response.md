Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` within the range 1 to 10^9. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following logic: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`; otherwise, it prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
