Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and the values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged as they were input for each test case. The loop prints the calculated value for each test case, which is either `a * n` if `b <= a`, or `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` where `k = min(n, b - a)`.**
