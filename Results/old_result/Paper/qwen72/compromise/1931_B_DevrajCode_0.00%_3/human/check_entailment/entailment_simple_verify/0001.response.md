### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all `n` containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`, ensuring that a target amount `target = total_water // n` is an integer.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - To achieve the target amount in each container, the water must be redistributed such that no container ever has less water than the target amount during the redistribution process.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the total water and the target amount for each container.
   - Iterate through the containers and keep a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the running sum becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target amount, and it cannot be balanced by pouring water from a container with a higher index. Hence, it is impossible to achieve the target amount in all containers.
   - If the running sum remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it is possible to achieve the target amount in all containers.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the input and splits it into a list.
   - It extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - It calculates the total water and checks if it is divisible by `n` (which is guaranteed by the problem statement).
   - It calculates the target amount of water for each container.
   - It iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If the running sum becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the running sum becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the total water is divisible by `n` (as guaranteed by the problem statement).
   - It correctly checks if the running sum of differences becomes negative, which is a valid condition to determine if the redistribution is impossible.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the key observations and the algorithm.
- The code is analyzed accurately, and the edge cases are considered.
- The logic of maintaining a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount is sound.
- The condition to return 'No' if the running sum becomes negative is appropriate.

### Annotated Code Validation:
- **State before function call**: `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`.
- **State after `total_water` calculation**: `total_water` is the sum of `a`, and it is divisible by `n`.
- **State after `target` calculation**: `target` is the target amount of water for each container, which is an integer.
- **State during the loop**: `container` is the running sum of the differences between the current container's water and the target amount.
  - If `container` becomes negative, it indicates that the current container has less water than the target amount, and it cannot be balanced by pouring water from a container with a higher index.
  - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it indicates that the redistribution is possible.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The reasoning and the implementation are sound.

Final: **True**
