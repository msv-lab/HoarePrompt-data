### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have `n` containers with initial water amounts `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of all water amounts is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - To achieve the target amount in each container, we need to ensure that the water can be redistributed such that no container ever has less water than the target amount during the redistribution process.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Calculate the total water and the target amount for each container.
   - Iterate through the containers and keep a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the running sum becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target amount, and it cannot be balanced by pouring water from a container with a higher index. Hence, it is impossible to achieve the target amount in all containers.
   - If the running sum remains non-negative throughout the iteration, it is possible to achieve the target amount in all containers.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the input and splits it into a list.
   - It extracts the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `a`.
   - It calculates the total water and checks if it is divisible by `n` (which is guaranteed by the problem statement).
   - It calculates the target amount of water for each container.
   - It iterates through the containers, maintaining a running sum of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - If the running sum becomes negative, it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without the running sum becoming negative, it returns 'Yes'.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The initial state of the program is correctly described: `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of non-negative integers such that the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total water and the target amount.
   - The function iterates through the containers and maintains a running sum (`container`) of the differences between the current container's water and the target amount.
   - The condition `if container < 0` correctly checks if the running sum becomes negative, indicating that it is impossible to achieve the target amount in all containers.
   - The final state of the function is correctly described: if the running sum remains non-negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the total water is divisible by `n` (as guaranteed by the problem statement).
   - It correctly checks if the running sum of differences becomes negative, which is a valid condition to determine if the redistribution is impossible.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The reasoning and the implementation are sound.

Final: **True**
