Postcondition: ***`a` must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 1, and `counter` is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the conditions inside the loop. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the conditions inside the loop, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
