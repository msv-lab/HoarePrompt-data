Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a non-empty string containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a non-empty string containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from the second character of `a` and the first character of `b`, or 1 if a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` are encountered, or the loop breaks if any other mismatch is found, and `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` if `work` is True, or the first character of `b` if `work` is False, `i` is 1, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from the second character of `a` and the first character of `b`, or 1 if a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` are encountered, or the loop breaks if any other mismatch is found, and `work` is False if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]` or if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, otherwise `work` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters. If `work` is True, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `a` and the character at index 2 of `a`, and `i` is 3 if `i + 1 < len(a)`, otherwise `i` is 2. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `b` and, if `i + 1 == len(a)`, the character at index 2 of `b`. In both cases, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from the second character of `a` and the first character of `b`, or 1 if a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` are encountered, or the loop breaks if any other mismatch is found, and `work` is False if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]` or if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, otherwise `work` is True.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive matching characters from `a` and `b` starting from the second character of `a` and the first character of `b`, or 1 if a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` are encountered, or the loop breaks if any other mismatch is found. If `work` is True, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `a[i]`. If `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, or if `i + 1 == len(a)`, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1 < len(a)`, `i` is 4, otherwise `i` is 3. If `work` is False, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `b[i]` and `i` is 4 if `i + 1 < len(a)`, otherwise `i` is 3. `work` is False if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]` or if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, otherwise `work` is True.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
