The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1 or 2 if `work` is True, or 2 if `work` is False. Therefore, if `work` is True, `i` becomes 2 or 3. If `work` is False, `i` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans` is extended by the character at index `i` of `b`, `_` is incremented by 1, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings, each containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 2 or 3 if `work` is True, or 3 if `work` is False, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` that match the corresponding characters in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]`, or 1 if the loop was reset due to a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop was broken if any character in `a` from `a[1]` to `a[len(a) - 1]` did not match the corresponding character in `b` from `b[0]` to `b[len(a) - 2]` and was not a '0' followed by a '1', `work` is True or False depending on the initial state.**
