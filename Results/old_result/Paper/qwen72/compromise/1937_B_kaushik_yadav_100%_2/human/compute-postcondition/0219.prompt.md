Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `_` is incremented by the length of `a`, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` and `b` are non-empty strings containing the new input provided by the user, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace, and must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the conditions in the loop, `i` is `len(a)`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is 1, `work` is False if the loop breaks or if `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]` or if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, otherwise `work` is True.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 0. If the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `counter` is increased by 1. If the second character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, and the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', `counter` is 1. Otherwise, if the second character of `a` is not '0' or the first character of `b` is not '1', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 1, and `counter` is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the conditions inside the loop. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the conditions inside the loop, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2, and `counter` is either increased by 1 or set to 1 based on the conditions inside the loop. If `a[j + 1]` equals `b[j]`, `counter` is increased by 1. If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', `counter` is set to 1. Otherwise, `counter` is either increased by 1 or set to 1, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
