Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `arr` is an empty list, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2):
    if lex <= 26:
        arr.append(1)
        lex = lex - 1
    elif lex < 52:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26
    else:
        arr.append(26)
        lex = lex - 26


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `k` is 3, and `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26]` and `lex` is an integer between 1 and 25. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26]` and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1]` or `[1, 26]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` or `[26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 25.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1, 1]` or `[1, 26, 1]`, and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1, 1]` or `[26, 26, 1]`, and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1, 1]` or `[26, 26, 1]`, and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 25. If `lex` is greater than 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1, 26]` or `[1, 26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between -25 and 0. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1, 26]` or `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1, 26]` or `[26, 26, 26]` and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 25.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
