Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` contains an additional element 26, and `lex` is an integer between -24 and 74.** 

The value of `lex` is updated to `lex - 26`. Since `lex` was initially an integer between 2 and 100, after subtracting 26, the new value of `lex` is an integer between -24 and 74. The other variables remain unchanged.
