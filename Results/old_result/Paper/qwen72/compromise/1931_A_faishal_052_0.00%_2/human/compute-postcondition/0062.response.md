The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer `1` to the end of the list `arr`. The initial state specifies different conditions for the list `arr` based on the value of `lex`. However, regardless of the initial value of `lex`, the list `arr` will have an additional element `1` appended to it. The values of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `k` is 3, `lex` is an input integer. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1]`. If `lex` is between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` and `lex` is an integer between 1 and 25. If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1]` and `lex` is an integer greater than or equal to 26.**
