Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3. If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `arr` is a list containing `[1, 1, 1]` or `[1, 26, 1]`, and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 25. If `lex` was between 27 and 51, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1, 1]` or `[26, 26, 1]`, and `lex` is now an integer between 0 and 24. If `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, `arr` is a list containing `[26, 1, 1]` or `[26, 26, 1]`, and `lex` is now an integer greater than or equal to 25.**
