Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2.
Code of the loop:
for k in range(3):
    print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2, `k` is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2, `k` is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2, `k` is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
