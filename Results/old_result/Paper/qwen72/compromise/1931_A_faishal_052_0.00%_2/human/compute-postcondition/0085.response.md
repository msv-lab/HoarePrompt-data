To determine what will be printed by the code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `cases` is an integer between 2 and 100.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `k` is 3.
   - `arr` is a sorted list based on the conditions provided for `lex`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is using the `chr` function to convert a value to its corresponding character.
   - The value being converted is `arr[k] + 96`.
   - `k` is 3, so `arr[k]` refers to the element at index 3 of the list `arr`.

4. **Understanding `arr` and `lex`:**
   - The list `arr` is sorted based on the conditions provided for `lex`. However, the exact conditions for `lex` are not provided in the initial state.
   - Without the exact conditions, we can only assume that `arr` is a list of integers, and since it is sorted, the elements are in ascending order.

5. **Calculating the Output:**
   - `arr[k]` is the element at index 3 of the list `arr`.
   - `chr(arr[k] + 96)` converts the integer `arr[k] + 96` to its corresponding character. The `chr` function returns the character whose ASCII value is the integer provided.
   - For example, if `arr[k]` is 1, then `arr[k] + 96` is 97, and `chr(97)` is 'a'.
   - If `arr[k]` is 2, then `arr[k] + 96` is 98, and `chr(98)` is 'b'.
   - The `end=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that no newline is added after the printed character, so the output will be a single character without any trailing newline.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the exact values of `arr` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the value at index 3 of `arr`.
   - The character printed will be the ASCII character corresponding to `arr[3] + 96`.

Output: **chr(arr[3] + 96) (where arr[3] is the element at index 3 of the sorted list `arr`)**
