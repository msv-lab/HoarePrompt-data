The code `arr.append(1)` adds the integer 1 to the list `arr`. The values of `cases`, `i`, `lex`, and `j` remain unchanged. The list `arr` initially contains either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element (1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise 26). After appending 1, the list `arr` will have one more element, which is 1.

Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element (1 if `lex` <= 26, otherwise 26), and an additional 1, `lex` is an input integer, and `j` is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now less than or equal to 25. If `lex` was between 26 and 51, `lex` is updated to a value between 0 and 25. If `lex` was between 52 and 100, `lex` remains an input integer.**
