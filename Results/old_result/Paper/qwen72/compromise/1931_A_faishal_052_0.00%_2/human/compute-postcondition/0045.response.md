The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`. Therefore, we can only adjust these variables. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `cases`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100.
- `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` is 1.
- `cases` must still be greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `cases` must be greater than 1.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2, `k` is 3**
