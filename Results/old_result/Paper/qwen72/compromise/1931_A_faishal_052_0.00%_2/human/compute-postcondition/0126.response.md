The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the implicit variable controlling the range of the loop. The loop will execute 3 times regardless of the initial value of `k`, as `range(3)` will generate the sequence `[0, 1, 2]`, and `k` will take these values in each iteration.

However, since the task is to adjust the state for the loop to execute, and the loop will execute regardless of the initial value of `k` (as long as it is an integer, which it is), the primary focus should be on ensuring that the loop can start. The loop will start with `k` being set to 0 by the `range(3)` function.

Given the initial state, we can adjust `k` to be 0, which is what it will be set to when the loop starts. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list that now contains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value**
