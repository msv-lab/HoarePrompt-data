Functionality: ** The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing an encoded word. The function then decodes the word into a 3-character string, where the first two characters are either 'a' or 'z' and the third character is determined by the remaining value of `n` after the decoding process. The function prints the decoded string for each test case and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `cases - 1`, and the final state of the program includes the sorted list `arr` with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being the remaining value of `n` after the loop's operations. **
