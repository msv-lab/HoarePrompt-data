The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the range `3`. The loop can execute again if `k` is less than `3`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is sorted in ascending order with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being `lex` (where `lex` is between 0 and 25 if it was between 26 and 51 initially, or between 26 and 74 if it was between 52 and 100 initially, or `lex - 2` if it was less than or equal to 26 initially), `j` is 2, `k` is 2**
