Postcondition: ***`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element 26, `j` is 1. If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, `lex` is updated to a value between -25 and 25. If `lex` is between 26 and 51, `lex` is updated to a value between 0 and 25. If `lex` is between 52 and 100, `lex` remains an input integer.***
