Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list containing either the element 1 or the integer 26, and now includes an additional element 26, `lex` is an input integer, and `j` is 2. If `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `lex` is now less than or equal to 25. If `lex` was between 26 and 51, `lex` is updated to a value between 0 and 25. If `lex` was between 52 and 100, `lex` remains an input integer.**

The code snippet `arr.append(26)` adds the integer 26 to the end of the list `arr`. The other variables (`cases`, `i`, `lex`, and `j`) remain unchanged. The specific conditions for `lex` are still valid, and the list `arr` now contains one more element, which is 26.
