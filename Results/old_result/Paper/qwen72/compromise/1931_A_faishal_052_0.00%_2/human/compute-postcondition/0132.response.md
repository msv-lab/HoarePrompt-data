Output State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list that now contains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `k` is 3, and the other variables (`cases`, `i`, `j`, `arr`, and `lex`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The loop iterates 3 times, printing the characters corresponding to the values in the `arr` list, but it does not modify the values of `arr`, `cases`, `i`, `j`, or `lex`.
