The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the implicit `range(3)` object, so we can only adjust those.

According to the code, the loop will execute 3 times regardless of the initial value of `k`, because `range(3)` will generate the sequence `[0, 1, 2]` and `k` will be set to each of these values in turn.

However, the initial state provided includes `k` being 3, which is not relevant to the execution of the loop since `k` will be reassigned to 0 at the start of the loop. Therefore, we do not need to adjust `k` for the loop to execute.

The loop will execute as long as `range(3)` is defined, which it is. The initial state of `cases`, `i`, `j`, and `arr` are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `k` is 3, `arr` is a sorted list based on the conditions provided for `lex`**
