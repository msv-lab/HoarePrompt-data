The only objects in the loop head are the variables `k` and the range defined as `range(3)`. The loop will execute if `k` is within the range defined by `range(3)`, which means `k` must be less than 3. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and it must still be less than 3 for the loop to continue.

The state of `arr`, `cases`, `i`, and `j` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`cases` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `k` is 2, `arr` is a sorted list that now contains `[1, 1, lex]` if `lex` was less than or equal to 26, `[1, 26, lex]` if `lex` was between 27 and 51, or `[1, 26, 26]` if `lex` was greater than or equal to 52, and `lex` is an integer between 0 and 24, 0 and 25, or greater than or equal to 26, depending on its initial value**
