Reasoning:

The program aims to decode an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) back into the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that could have been encoded to `n`. The encoding process sums the positions of the letters in the alphabet, and the decoding process should reverse this to find the smallest possible word.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `cases` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then attempts to decode the integer `lex` by breaking it down into three parts:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - This process is repeated twice to determine the first two letters.
   - The remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr` as the third letter.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - The program then converts the positions in `arr` to their corresponding letters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` and prints them.

4. **Issues**:
   - The decoding logic is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the distribution of the remaining value of `lex` to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The logic for the first two letters always appends either 1 or 26, which is not always correct. For example, if `lex` is 24, the correct decoding should be `aav` (1 + 1 + 22), but the program might incorrectly output `aaa` (1 + 1 + 22) or `azz` (26 + 1 + 1).

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, the program should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then determine the third letter.
   - For example, for `lex` = 24, the correct approach would be:
     - First letter: `a` (1)
     - Second letter: `a` (1)
     - Third letter: `v` (22)
   - This ensures that the word is lexicographically smallest.

Given the issues in the decoding logic, the program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer.

Correctness: **False**
