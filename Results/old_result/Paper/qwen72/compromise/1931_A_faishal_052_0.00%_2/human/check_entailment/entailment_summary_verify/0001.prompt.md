You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing an encoded word. The function then decodes the word into a 3-character string, where the first two characters are either 'a' or 'z' and the third character is determined by the remaining value of `n` after the decoding process. The function prints the decoded string for each test case and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `cases` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is `cases - 1`, and the final state of the program includes the sorted list `arr` with the first two elements being either 1 or 26, and the third element being the remaining value of `n` after the loop's operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value of a 3-letter word.

2. **Array Initialization and Logic**: The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters that will form the word. It then enters a loop that runs twice (for the first two letters of the word). The logic inside the loop is designed to determine the positions of these letters by subtracting the largest possible values (26) from `lex` and appending the corresponding values to `arr`.

3. **Handling the Third Letter**: After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`. This value represents the position of the third letter in the word.

4. **Sorting the Array**: The program sorts `arr` to ensure that the letters are in the lexicographically smallest order. This is a crucial step because the smallest possible word is formed by arranging the letters in ascending order.

5. **Output**: The program then prints the characters corresponding to the positions in `arr` by converting each position to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`. The `+ 96` is used because the ASCII value of 'a' is 97, and the positions are 1-indexed.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `lex = 3`, the program correctly outputs "aaa" because the smallest possible values for the letters are all 1.
   - For `lex = 78`, the program correctly outputs "zzz" because the largest possible values for the letters are all 26.
   - For other values, the program ensures that the letters are as small as possible while still summing up to `lex`.

However, there is a logical issue in the program that needs to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Value**: The program does not correctly handle the remaining value of `lex` after the first two iterations. It should ensure that the remaining value is added to `arr` and then sorted to find the lexicographically smallest word.

Let's correct the program and re-evaluate:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()  # Add a newline after each word

# Test the function with the provided example
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Handling Remaining Value**: The program now correctly handles the remaining value of `lex` after the first two iterations by appending it to `arr` and then sorting the array.
- **Newline After Each Word**: Added `print()` after the loop to ensure each word is printed on a new line.

### Re-evaluation:
- **Test Case 1 (24)**: The program should output "aav". The positions are [1, 1, 22], which sorts to [1, 1, 22] and converts to "aav".
- **Test Case 2 (70)**: The program should output "rzz". The positions are [26, 26, 18], which sorts to [18, 26, 26] and converts to "rzz".
- **Test Case 3 (3)**: The program should output "aaa". The positions are [1, 1, 1], which sorts to [1, 1, 1] and converts to "aaa".
- **Test Case 4 (55)**: The program should output "czz". The positions are [26, 26, 3], which sorts to [3, 26, 26] and converts to "czz".
- **Test Case 5 (48)**: The program should output "auz". The positions are [26, 22, 1], which sorts to [1, 22, 26] and converts to "auz".

The corrected program now correctly handles all test cases and produces the expected output.
