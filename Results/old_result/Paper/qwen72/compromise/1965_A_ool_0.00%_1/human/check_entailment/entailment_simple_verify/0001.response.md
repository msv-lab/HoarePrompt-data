### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the initial number of stones in each pile `arr`.
   - This part of the program is correctly structured to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the winner of the game.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to track whether Alice or Bob wins.
   - The first condition checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. However, the condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect because it checks the first element of the list, not the smallest pile size. The correct condition should be `if min(arr) != 1:`.

3. **Set and Sorting:**
   - The program converts the list `arr` to a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the unique pile sizes.
   - This is done to check the differences between consecutive pile sizes.
   - While this approach is not the most efficient, it is not inherently incorrect for the purpose of determining the game's outcome.

4. **Consecutive Differences Check:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes and checks if the difference between consecutive sizes is greater than 1.
   - If the difference is greater than 1, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks the loop. This indicates that the pile sizes are not consecutive.
   - If the difference is exactly 1, it toggles the boolean variable `A` to switch between Alice and Bob.
   - The logic here is based on the idea that if the pile sizes are consecutive, the game can be reduced to a simpler form, and the winner can be determined by the parity of the number of unique pile sizes.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - If `not_c` is `True`, it means all pile sizes are consecutive, and the program toggles `A` one more time.
   - Finally, it returns "Alice" if `A` is `True` and "Bob" if `A` is `False`.

### Issues:
- **Initial Condition Check:**
  - The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect. The smallest pile size should be checked, not the first element of the list. The correct condition should be `if min(arr) != 1:`.
  - This can lead to incorrect results if the smallest pile size is not the first element in the list.

- **Set and Sorting:**
  - The set and sorting operations are not necessary for the given problem. The game's outcome can be determined by the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
  - This makes the program less efficient and more complex than it needs to be.

### Correct Solution:
- The game can be simplified by noting that the winner depends on the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
- If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())

while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    odd_count = sum(1 for x in arr if x % 2 == 1)
    return 'Alice' if odd_count % 2 == 1 else 'Bob'
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical issues and does not correctly determine the winner based on the game's rules.
- The corrected program correctly determines the winner by counting the number of piles with an odd number of stones and checking the parity.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
