Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Reading Input Incorrectly**:
   - The program reads the number of piles `n` and the pile sizes `arr` in a single line, which is incorrect. The number of piles `n` should be read in one line, and then the pile sizes `arr` should be read in the next line.
   - The variable `c` is defined but never used, which is unnecessary.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the winner, but it has a flawed logic:
     - The condition `if arr[0] != 1:` is incorrect because it only checks the first element of the array, which is not a valid way to determine the winner.
     - The logic for checking if the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set of pile sizes is greater than 1 is also incorrect. This logic does not correctly determine the winner based on the game rules.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct approach to determine the winner is to check if the number of distinct pile sizes is even or odd. If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.
   - This is because the game is essentially about whether the smallest pile size can be reduced to zero in an even or odd number of moves. If the smallest pile size can be reduced to zero in an even number of moves, Bob wins. If it can be reduced in an odd number of moves, Alice wins.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
t = int(input())

while t > 0:
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))
    r = func_1(arr)
    print(r)
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr):
    distinct_piles = len(set(arr))
    return 'Alice' if distinct_piles % 2 == 1 else 'Bob'
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading Input**:
  - The number of test cases `t` is read first.
  - For each test case, the number of piles `n` is read, followed by the pile sizes `arr`.
- **Determining the Winner**:
  - The function `func_1` calculates the number of distinct pile sizes using `set(arr)`.
  - If the number of distinct pile sizes is odd, Alice wins. If it is even, Bob wins.

This corrected program should correctly determine the winner for each test case based on the problem description.
