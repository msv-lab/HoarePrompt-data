Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple piles with the same number of stones correctly. For example, consider the input where there are multiple piles with the same number of stones, such as:

```
1
3
1 1 1
```

According to the problem description, Alice should win because she can choose \( k = 1 \) and remove one stone from each pile, thus emptying all piles in one move. However, the program will incorrectly return "Bob" because it only checks the first element of the array and does not consider the possibility of multiple piles with the same number of stones. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not follow the optimal strategy for the game.
