You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of arr is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    if (arr[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'.
    #State: `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive; `A` is False; the first element of `arr` is 1
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` remains unchanged; `A` is True; `set_` remains unchanged; `not_c` is False. 
    #
    #Explanation: 
    #- The loop iterates over the indices of `set_` starting from 1.
    #- For each iteration, it checks if the difference between the current element and the previous element in `set_` is greater than 1.
    #- If the difference is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to False and the loop breaks.
    #- If the difference is not greater than 1, `A` is toggled (flipped between True and False).
    #- Since `set_` is a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` and the first element of `arr` is 1, if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, `not_c` will be set to False and the loop will break.
    #- If there are no gaps greater than 1, `A` will be toggled for each element in `set_` except the first one. Since `A` starts as False and is toggled an odd number of times (because the loop starts from index 1), `A` will end up as True.
    #- `arr` and `set_` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *`arr` remains unchanged; `A` is True if `not_c` is False, otherwise `A` is False; `set_` remains unchanged; `not_c` retains its initial value.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if `not_c` is False, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` representing piles of stones. It returns 'Alice' in Case_1. In Case_2, if `not_c` is False, it returns 'Alice'; otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'.

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if `not_c` is False, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
