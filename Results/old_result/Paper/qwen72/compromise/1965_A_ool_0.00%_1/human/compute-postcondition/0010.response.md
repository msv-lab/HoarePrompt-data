Postcondition: **`arr` remains unchanged; `A` is True; `set_` remains unchanged; `not_c` is False. However, since the if condition `if (not_c)` is being evaluated, it implies that `not_c` is currently True. Therefore, the postcondition is: `arr` remains unchanged; `A` is True; `set_` remains unchanged; `not_c` is True.**
