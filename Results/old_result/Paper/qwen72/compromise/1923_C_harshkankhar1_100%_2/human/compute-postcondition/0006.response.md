The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `q`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `a` and `b` as described does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure `q` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts.

State: **`q` must be greater than 0**
