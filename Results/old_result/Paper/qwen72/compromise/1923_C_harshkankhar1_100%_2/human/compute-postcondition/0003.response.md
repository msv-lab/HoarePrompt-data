The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `n`. To ensure the loop can execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 1.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains between 1 and 10^4.
- For the current test case, `n` is the length of the array `c` and `q` is the number of queries, both of which are integers provided by the user and are within the range 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5.
- The elements of the array `c` and the queries are yet to be defined.
- `a` is a list of integers starting with 0, followed by the integers provided by the user.
- `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`.

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `i` should start at 1.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` remains between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer provided by the user and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers starting with 0, followed by the integers provided by the user, `b` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1**
