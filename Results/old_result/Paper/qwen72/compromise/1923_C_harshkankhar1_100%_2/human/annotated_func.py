#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept multiple test cases, each with an array c of positive integers and a set of queries. Specifically, the input should be structured such that the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array c and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array c. The following q lines each contain two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The list `b` will contain cumulative sums where each element is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `a` (excluding the first element, which is 0) is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. The length of `b` will still be `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `a` remain unchanged.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The list `a` will contain cumulative sums of its original values, and the list `b` will still contain cumulative sums where each element (excluding the first element, which is 0) is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in the new `a` (after cumulative sum) is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. The length of `b` will still be `n + 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and the original `a` remain unchanged. The loop will print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the comparison of the differences between the cumulative sums of `a` and `b` for each query, and the final state of `a` and `b` will be the same as their state after the cumulative sums and adjustments are applied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array `c` of positive integers and a set of queries. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`, then reads the array `c`. It computes two cumulative sum lists `a` and `b`. The list `a` contains the cumulative sums of the original array `c`, while the list `b` contains cumulative sums where each element is incremented by 1 if the corresponding element in `c` is greater than 1, or by 2 otherwise. For each query, it checks if the difference in cumulative sums between the specified subarray in `a` is less than the difference in cumulative sums in `b` for the same subarray, or if the subarray is a single element. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any values, but it prints the results of the queries directly.
