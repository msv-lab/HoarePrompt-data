Precondition: **The function should accept multiple test cases, each with an array c of positive integers and a set of queries. Specifically, the input should be structured such that the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array c and the number of queries, respectively. The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array c. The following q lines each contain two integers l_i and r_i (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the i-th subarray. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases, the array c, and the queries. Here is a more appropriate function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing the array `c` and the list of queries. For example:

```python
test_cases = [
    (5, 4, [1, 2, 1, 4, 5], [(1, 5), (4, 4), (3, 4), (1, 3)]),
    # Additional test cases can be added here
]
```

This structure ensures that the function can handle multiple test cases as described in the problem.
