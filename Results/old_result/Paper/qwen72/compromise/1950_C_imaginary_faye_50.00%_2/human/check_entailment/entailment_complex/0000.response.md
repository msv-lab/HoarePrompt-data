Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly handles the conversion from 24-hour format to 12-hour format for each test case. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times, reading a time string `s` in 24-hour format for each test case.
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it converts to `12` in 12-hour format.
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it remains the same.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hour to get the equivalent 12-hour format.
3. **Minute Handling**: The minutes are directly appended to the hour without any modification.
4. **AM/PM Determination**: The function correctly appends 'AM' if the hour is less than 12 and 'PM' if the hour is 12 or greater.

The function's logic aligns with the problem description and the provided example. It correctly handles all edge cases, such as `00:00` and `12:00`.

Correctness: **True**
