You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        print(' ')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) representing the size of an n x n grid. The function then prints a series of lines, each containing the number `1` followed by a space and the integer `i` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n`). After processing all test cases, the function ends with `t` being 0, `n` being the last input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), and `i` being `n`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires selecting \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is defined as \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution provided in the program always selects cells in the first row of the grid, i.e., \((1, i)\) for \( i \) in the range from 1 to \( n \).
   - This means the selected cells are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), ..., \((1, n)\).

3. **Evaluating the Distances:**
   - For any two cells \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) where \( i \neq j \), the Manhattan distance is \( |1 - 1| + |i - j| = |i - j| \).
   - The possible values of \( |i - j| \) range from 1 to \( n-1 \) because \( i \) and \( j \) are distinct and both range from 1 to \( n \).

4. **Set of Distances:**
   - The set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain all integers from 1 to \( n-1 \).
   - The size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \( n-1 \).

5. **Maximizing the Set:**
   - The maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( n-1 \), which is achieved by the provided solution.
   - This is because the maximum distance between any two cells in a single row is \( n-1 \), and all intermediate distances are also covered.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program correctly outputs \( n \) points for each test case, and the format matches the problem's requirements.
   - However, there is an unnecessary `print(' ')` at the end of the program, which does not affect the correctness but is not needed.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct in terms of solving the problem as described. It maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for the given \( n \) and outputs the points in the correct format.
