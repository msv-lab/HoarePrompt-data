Let's analyze the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is a positive integer with a range \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
- `t` is then updated to `t - 1`, so the new value of `t` is \(0 \leq t \leq 49\).
- `n` is an input integer with a range \(2 \leq n \leq 10^3\).
- `i` is 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('1', end=' ')
```

### Analysis:
- The `print` statement is printing the string `'1'`.
- The `end=' '` parameter in the `print` function specifies that after printing the string `'1'`, the output should be followed by a space instead of a newline.

### Output:
The code will print the string `'1'` followed by a space.

Output: **1 **

This output is consistent with the given initial state and the behavior of the `print` function in Python.
