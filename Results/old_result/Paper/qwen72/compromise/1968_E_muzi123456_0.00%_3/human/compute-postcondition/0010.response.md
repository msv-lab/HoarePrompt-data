The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 3**
