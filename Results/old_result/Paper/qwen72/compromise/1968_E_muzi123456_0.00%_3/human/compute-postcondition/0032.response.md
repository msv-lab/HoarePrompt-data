To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, and `i` will start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3.
- `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3).
- `i` is `n`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since `n` is given to be in the range 2 to 10^3), and `i` should start from 1, not `n`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3, `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 1**
