The function `func` does not accept any input parameters. However, it is designed to handle multiple test cases internally. Each test case involves an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), representing the size of an n x n grid. The function processes a series of such test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50). The function returns the results of processing these test cases, which are not specified in the given information.
