Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and is now `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is `n`.**

Explanation: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` remains as `t - 1` because it is not modified within the loop. The variable `n` also remains unchanged as it is only used to define the range of the loop. The loop variable `i` will have the value `n` after the final iteration, since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
