The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 48) and is now `t - 3` with `t` being at least 3, `n` is a new input integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3), `i` is 2**
