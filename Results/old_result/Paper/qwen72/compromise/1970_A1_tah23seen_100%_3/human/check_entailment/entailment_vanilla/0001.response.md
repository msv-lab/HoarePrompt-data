### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `n` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with this string and prints the result.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result and a dictionary `d` to keep track of the prefix balances.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The balance is stored at the key `i + 1` in the dictionary `d`, where `i` is the current index in the string.

3. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the balance at the end of the string (which is `n` in length) is not needed for the shuffle operation.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the balance values (`x[1]`), and in case of ties, by the position in decreasing order (`-x[0]`).

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted items of the dictionary `d` and constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary.
   - Finally, the result string `ans` is returned.

### Analysis:

- **Balance Calculation**:
  - The balance calculation is correct. It correctly computes the balance of each prefix of the string.
  - The balance is stored at `i + 1` to align with the position in the string, which is a valid approach.

- **Dictionary Manipulation**:
  - The removal of the last entry from the dictionary is necessary because the balance at the end of the string is always 0 (since the string is balanced), and it is not needed for the shuffle operation.
  - The sorting of the dictionary items is correct. It sorts by balance in increasing order and by position in decreasing order for ties, which matches the problem description.

- **Result Construction**:
  - The construction of the result string `ans` is correct. It appends characters from the original string `s` based on the sorted positions, which ensures that the characters are placed in the correct order for the balanced shuffle.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. It handles the input, calculates the balances, sorts the positions, and constructs the result string accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
