### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the input string `n` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with this string and prints the result.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result and a dictionary `d` to keep track of the prefix balances.
   - The dictionary `d` is initialized with `d[0] = 0` to represent the balance before the first character.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and updates the balance in the dictionary `d`:
     - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented.
     - If the character is ')', the balance is decremented.
   - The balance is stored at the key `i + 1` in the dictionary `d`, where `i` is the current index in the string.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Dictionary Manipulation**:
   - The program removes the last entry from the dictionary `d` using `d.pop(n)`. This is because the balance at the end of the string (which is `n` in length) is always 0 (since the string is balanced), and it is not needed for the shuffle operation.
   - The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the balance values (`x[1]`), and in case of ties, by the position in decreasing order (`-x[0]`).
   - This part is also correct and aligns with the problem description. The sorting ensures that characters are ordered by their prefix balance in ascending order, and for the same balance, by their position in descending order.

4. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted items of the dictionary `d` and constructs the result string `ans` by appending the characters from the original string `s` at the positions specified by the sorted dictionary.
   - The key point here is that the positions in the dictionary `d` are `i + 1` (1-based index), so when appending characters to `ans`, the program should use `s[i - 1]` to correctly access the characters in the 0-based indexed string `s`.
   - However, the program uses `s[i]` instead of `s[i - 1]`, which is incorrect. This will result in an off-by-one error, causing the wrong characters to be appended to `ans`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the balance calculation and dictionary manipulation steps. However, the result construction step has an off-by-one error, which means the characters are not appended to the result string in the correct order. This error violates the problem's requirement for the balanced shuffle operation.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
