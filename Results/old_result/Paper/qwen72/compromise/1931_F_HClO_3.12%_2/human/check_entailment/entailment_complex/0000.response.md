### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of participants `n` and the number of screenshots `m`.
   - If `m` (the number of screenshots) is 1, the function immediately prints "yes" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if there is only one screenshot, the order of participants is trivially consistent with the order shown in the screenshot.

2. **Processing the First Two Screenshots:**
   - The function reads the first two lines of the screenshot and splits them into the author (`a1`, `a2`) and the remaining participants (`l1`, `l2`).
   - It then creates `l11` and `l22` by removing the author from the respective lists.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the function prints "no" and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the remaining participants in the two screenshots are not the same, the order of participants cannot be consistent.

3. **Finding the Swap Indices:**
   - The function initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0.
   - It iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the indices where the participants differ.
   - If the participants differ, it checks if the difference is due to the authors being swapped. If so, it sets `idx1` and `idx2` to the current index and breaks the loop.
   - If the participants differ in a way that cannot be explained by a simple swap, it prints "no" and continues to the next test case.

4. **Handling the Remaining Screenshots:**
   - If `idx1` and `idx2` are both -1, it means the lists are identical, and the function prints "yes" if `m` is 2.
   - If `idx1` and `idx2` are not both -1, it determines the correct order by inserting the author into the appropriate position.
   - The function then reads the remaining `m-2` screenshots and stores them in the list `val`.
   - For each remaining screenshot, it checks if the order of participants (excluding the author) matches the determined order. If any screenshot does not match, it prints "no" and breaks the loop.
   - If all remaining screenshots match, it prints "yes".

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It checks the consistency of the order of participants in the screenshots and prints the appropriate response for each test case. The logic for handling the first two screenshots and the remaining ones is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
