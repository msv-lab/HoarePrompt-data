The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of chat participants `n` and the number of participants who posted screenshots `k`. For each test case, it reads the order of participants shown to each screenshot author and determines if the conditions for the chat participants and their screenshot postings are met. If the conditions are met, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not retain any values after processing each test case, and it iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
