Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 1 (though `t` is not used in the print statement).
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
   - `sum` is \( n^3 \) (though `sum` is not used in the print statement).
   - `i` is `n + 1` (though `i` is not used in the print statement).
   - `j` is 1.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - The first argument to the `print` function is the integer `2`.
   - The second argument is `n - j + 1`. Given that `j` is 1, this simplifies to `n - 1 + 1`, which is `n`.
   - The third argument is `*range(1, n + 1)`, which unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive). This will print the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The integer `2` will be printed first.
   - The value of `n` will be printed next.
   - The range from 1 to `n` will be printed as a sequence of integers separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **2, n, 1 2 3 ... n (where n is the value of n and the sequence is the numbers from 1 to n inclusive)**
