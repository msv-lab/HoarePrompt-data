The code snippet `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it. Let's break down the calculation:

1. `i` is 4.
2. `i * i` is `4 * 4`, which is 16.
3. `(i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `3 * 3`, which is 9.
4. `i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)` is `16 - 9`, which is 7.
5. `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is `7 * 4`, which is 28.
6. `sum` is initially 22, so `sum += 28` results in `sum` being 50.

The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is an input integer and must be greater than or equal to 4, `sum` is 50, `i` is 4, `j` is `n`**
