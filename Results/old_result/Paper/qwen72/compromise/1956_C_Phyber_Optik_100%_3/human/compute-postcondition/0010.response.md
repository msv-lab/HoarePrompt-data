Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\), `i` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The condition `t` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- The condition `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 is necessary for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `sum` starts at 1 and is updated in each iteration of the loop. The update formula in the loop is `sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i`, which simplifies to `sum += i * (2 * i - 1)`. This can be further simplified to `sum += i^3` (i.e., `sum` is incremented by the cube of `i` in each iteration).
- After all iterations, `sum` will be the initial value of 1 plus the sum of the cubes of all integers from 2 to `n`.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
