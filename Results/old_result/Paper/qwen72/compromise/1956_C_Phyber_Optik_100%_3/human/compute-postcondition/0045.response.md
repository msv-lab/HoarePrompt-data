Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is \(\text{previous\_n} + 1\), `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\)**

The value of `sum` is now 1, overriding its previous value which was \(\text{previous\_n}^3\). The other variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
