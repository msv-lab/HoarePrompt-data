The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 3. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `j` is 3**
