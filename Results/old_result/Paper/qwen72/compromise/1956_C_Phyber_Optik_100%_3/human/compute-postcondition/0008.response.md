The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` was 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3 for the condition `i < n + 1` to hold true.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `sum` is `7 + 2 * i * i - i`, `i` is 3**
