To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `j` starts at 1 and iterates up to `n`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (not relevant to the loop head)
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (relevant to the loop head)
- `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\) (not relevant to the loop head)
- `i` is \(n + 1\) (not relevant to the loop head)
- `j` is \(\text{previous\_n}\) (relevant to the loop head, but needs to be adjusted)

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (this is already given and correct)
- `j` must start at 1 (as per the loop head `for j in range(1, n + 1)`)

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `j` starts at 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\), `i` is \(n + 1\), `j` is 1**
