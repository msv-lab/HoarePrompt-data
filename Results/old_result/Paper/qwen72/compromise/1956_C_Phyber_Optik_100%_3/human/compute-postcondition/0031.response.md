Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `n` is the input integer, `sum` is \( n^3 \), `i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: This variable remains unchanged and must still be greater than 1.
- **`n`**: This variable is the input integer and remains unchanged.
- **`sum`**: After all iterations of the loop, the value of `sum` will be equal to \( n^3 \). This is because the loop accumulates the sum of the cubes of the integers from 1 to `n`.
- **`i`**: The loop variable `i` will be `n + 1` after the loop completes, as the loop runs from 2 to `n` inclusive.
- **`j`**: This variable remains unchanged and is still `n`.
