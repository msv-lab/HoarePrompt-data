Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
   - `sum` is defined as \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\).
   - `i` is \(n + 1\).
   - `j` is 3.

2. **Understanding the `sum` formula:**
   - The formula for `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\).
   - Simplifying the term inside the sum: \(k^2 - (k-1)^2 = k^2 - (k^2 - 2k + 1) = 2k - 1\).
   - Therefore, the formula becomes: \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (2k - 1) \cdot k\).
   - This can be further simplified to: \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (2k^2 - k)\).

3. **Understanding the print statement:**
   - The print statement is: `print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))`.
   - `1` is a constant value.
   - `n - j + 1` simplifies to `n - 3 + 1` which is `n - 2`.
   - `*range(1, n + 1)` unpacks the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive).

4. **Final Output:**
   - The first element printed is `1`.
   - The second element printed is `n - 2`.
   - The third element onwards, the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) is printed.

Given the initial state and the print statement, the output will be:

Output: **1, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n, which is greater than or equal to 3)**
