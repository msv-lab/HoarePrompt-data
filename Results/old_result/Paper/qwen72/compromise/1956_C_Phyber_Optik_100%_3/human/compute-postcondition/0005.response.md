The code snippet updates the value of `sum` by adding the result of the expression `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` to it. The expression simplifies to `i * (2 * i - 1)`, which is the difference between the square of `i` and the square of `i-1`, multiplied by `i`. The initial value of `sum` is 1, and the value of `i` is not specified, but it is used in the expression. The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is 1 + `i` * (2 * `i` - 1)**
