Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
1. `t` must be greater than 0.
2. `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
3. `sum` is calculated as \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} (k^2 - (k-1)^2) \cdot k\).
4. `i` is \(n + 1\).
5. `j` is 3.

### Print Statement:
```
print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **First Argument: `2`**
   - This is a constant value, so it will always print `2`.

2. **Second Argument: `n - j + 1`**
   - Given that `j` is 3, the expression simplifies to:
     \[
     n - 3 + 1 = n - 2
     \]
   - Therefore, the second argument will print `n - 2`.

3. **Third Argument: `*range(1, n + 1)`**
   - The `range(1, n + 1)` function generates a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - The `*` operator unpacks this sequence, so each integer in the range will be printed as separate arguments.

### Final Output:
- The first argument is `2`.
- The second argument is `n - 2`.
- The third argument is the unpacked sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Example Calculation:
- If `n` is 5, then:
  - The second argument `n - 2` will be `5 - 2 = 3`.
  - The third argument will be the unpacked sequence `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.

### General Output:
- For any `n` greater than or equal to 3, the output will be:
  - `2`
  - `n - 2`
  - The sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.

### Final Answer:
Output: **2, n - 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., n (where n is the value of n and the sequence is from 1 to n inclusive)**
