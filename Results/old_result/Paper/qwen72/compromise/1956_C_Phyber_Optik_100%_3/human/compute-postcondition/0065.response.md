The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of an n×n matrix. The number of test cases `t` is also an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5. The function returns the appropriate output for each test case based on the value of `n`.
