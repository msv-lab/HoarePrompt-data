To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This variable is initialized by the `range(1, n + 1)` function, which means `j` will start at 1.
2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. However, the state already specifies that `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, which satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than 0 (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 (this ensures the loop will execute).
- `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\) (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).
- `i` is `n` (this is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged).

For the loop to execute, `j` must start at 1 and `n` must be at least 2. The other variables (`t`, `sum`, and `i`) do not affect the loop head and can remain as they are.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is \(1 + \sum_{k=2}^{n} k^3\), `i` is `n`, `j` is 1**
