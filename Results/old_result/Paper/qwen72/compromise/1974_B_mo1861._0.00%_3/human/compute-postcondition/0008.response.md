The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `b`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function returns a new string `s` that is formed by concatenating the lowercase letters corresponding to each character in `b` as per the mapping in `char_map`. The `char_map` remains unchanged.
