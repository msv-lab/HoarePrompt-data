To ensure the for loop executes, we need to consider the objects in the loop head: `i`, `c`, and the expression `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.

1. **`i`**: This is the index variable that will be assigned by the `enumerate` function. It starts at 0 by default.
2. **`c`**: This is the character variable that will be assigned from the sorted set of characters in the string `b`.
3. **`enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`**: This expression generates an iterator that yields pairs of (index, character) from the sorted set of characters in `b`.

For the loop to execute:
- The set `set(b)` must contain at least one unique character.
- The `sorted` function will sort these unique characters, and the `enumerate` function will then provide an index starting from 0 for each character in the sorted set.

Given the initial state:
- `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- `char_map` is an empty dictionary.

We need to ensure that `b` has at least one unique character for the loop to execute. If `b` has at least one unique character, the loop will execute at least once.

State: **`b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `b` must have at least one unique character, `i` is 0, `c` is the first character in the sorted set of unique characters in `b`, `char_map` is an empty dictionary**
