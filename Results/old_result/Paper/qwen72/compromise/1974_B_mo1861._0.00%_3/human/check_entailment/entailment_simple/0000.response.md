Reasoning:

The program's goal is to decode a string `b` that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The encoding process involves creating a string `r` of distinct characters from `s` in alphabetical order and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, the program needs to reverse this process.

### Key Points to Check:
1. **Character Mapping**:
   - The program constructs a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character in `b` to its symmetric character in the alphabet.
   - The characters in `b` are sorted to form the string `r`, and then each character in `r` is mapped to a corresponding character starting from the end of the alphabet.

2. **Mapping Construction**:
   - The program uses `sorted(set(b))` to get the unique characters in `b` in sorted order.
   - It then maps each character to a corresponding character from the end of the alphabet using `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))`.

3. **Decoding Process**:
   - The program iterates over each character in `b` and constructs the decoded string `s` by replacing each character with its mapped value from `char_map`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Mapping**:
  - The mapping `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` is incorrect. The length of `b` is not the same as the length of the unique characters in `b`. The correct mapping should use the length of the unique characters in `b`, not the length of `b` itself.
  - The correct mapping should be `chr(ord('a') + (len(set(b)) - i - 1))`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
num_test_cases = int(input())
for _ in range(num_test_cases):
    num_chars = int(input())
    b = input()
    print(func_1(b))

def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    for (i, c) in enumerate(unique_chars):
        char_map[c] = unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - i - 1]
        
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    return s
```

### Explanation:
- **Correct Mapping**:
  - `unique_chars = sorted(set(b))` creates a sorted list of unique characters in `b`.
  - `char_map[c] = unique_chars[len(unique_chars) - i - 1]` correctly maps each character to its symmetric character in the sorted list of unique characters.

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it uses the length of `b` instead of the length of the unique characters in `b` for the mapping. This leads to incorrect decoding.

Correctness: **False**
