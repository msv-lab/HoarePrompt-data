Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1. In such a case, the only way to break `x` into `n` sub-problems with positive integer difficulties is to have each sub-problem difficulty as 1, which would result in a balance of 1. However, the program does not correctly handle this scenario.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 2
```
Here, `x = 7` and `n = 2`. Since 7 is a prime number, the only way to split 7 into 2 sub-problems with positive integer difficulties is to have difficulties of 1 and 6, or 2 and 5, or 3 and 4. The GCD of any of these pairs is 1. However, the program will not correctly identify this and will output 0, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this specific case.
