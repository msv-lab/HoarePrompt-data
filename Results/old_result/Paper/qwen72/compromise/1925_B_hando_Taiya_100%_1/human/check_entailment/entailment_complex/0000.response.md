### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case.
   - Inside the function `func_1`, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input, which are the difficulty of the original problem and the number of sub-problems, respectively.

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The goal is to find the maximum balance, which is the GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems.
   - The program iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `n` can be divided into sub-problems with difficulty `i` or `x // i`.

3. **Optimal Balance**:
   - If `n <= x // i`, then `i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems, and it updates `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`.
   - If `n <= i`, then `x // i` can be a valid difficulty for the sub-problems, and it updates `ans` to be the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum divisor `ans` that satisfies the conditions, which is the maximum balance of the problemset.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is equal to `x`, in which case the maximum balance is `x` itself.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is greater than `x`, which is not possible according to the problem constraints, but the program will print `0` if no valid divisor is found.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset by iterating over the divisors of `x` and checking the conditions for `n`. The logic is sound and should work for all valid inputs as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
