Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` reads the values of `x` and `n` for each test case.

3. **Finding the Maximum GCD**:
   - The program iterates over possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the integer square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`:
     - If `x % i == 0`, it means `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - The program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - The program also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i`. If true, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the maximum balance `ans` for each test case.

The logic ensures that the maximum possible GCD is found by considering both `i` and `x // i` for each divisor `i` of `x`. This approach is efficient and correct for the given constraints.

Thus, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
