The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `n`. `x` is an integer representing the difficulty of the original problem, with the constraint 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8. `n` is an integer representing the number of sub-problems, with the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ x. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `x` and `n`, where `x` is an integer representing the difficulty of the original problem (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8) and `n` is an integer representing the number of sub-problems (1 ≤ n ≤ x). The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not described.**
