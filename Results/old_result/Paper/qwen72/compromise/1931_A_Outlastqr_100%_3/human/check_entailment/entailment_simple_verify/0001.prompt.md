You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. However, the provided function definition does not include these parameters. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing the encoded word for a test case.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop prints a word based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, the word is the character at position `n - 53` in the alphabet string followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52 (inclusive), the word is 'a' followed by the character at position `n - 28` in the alphabet string and then 'z'. If `n` is 27, the word is 'aay'. If `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), the word is 'aa' followed by the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet string. The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it processes the corresponding `n` from the `test_cases` list and prints the resulting word. The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that sums to a given integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 78).
   - The letters are indexed from 1 to 26, where 'a' is 1 and 'z' is 26.
   - The sum of the indices of the letters in the word should equal `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a 3-letter word based on the value of `n`.

3. **Breaking Down the Cases**:
   - **Case 1: `n > 52`**:
     - If `n` is greater than 52, the program constructs the word by adding the letter corresponding to `n - 53` to the string, followed by "zz".
     - This is because the maximum sum of two letters is 52 (26 + 26), so if `n` is greater than 52, the first letter must be at least `n - 52` to make up the difference.
     - For example, if `n = 70`, the first letter is `alphabet[70 - 53] = alphabet[17] = 'r'`, and the word is "rzz".

   - **Case 2: `n > 27`**:
     - If `n` is between 28 and 52, the program constructs the word by adding "a" as the first letter, the letter corresponding to `n - 28` as the second letter, and "z" as the third letter.
     - This is because the maximum sum of the first letter "a" (1) and the third letter "z" (26) is 27, so the second letter must be at least `n - 27` to make up the difference.
     - For example, if `n = 55`, the second letter is `alphabet[55 - 28] = alphabet[27] = 'c'`, and the word is "czz".

   - **Case 3: `n == 27`**:
     - If `n` is exactly 27, the program constructs the word "aay".
     - This is because the sum of "a" (1), "a" (1), and "y" (25) is 27, and "aay" is the lexicographically smallest word that can be formed.

   - **Case 4: `n < 27`**:
     - If `n` is less than or equal to 26, the program constructs the word by adding "aa" as the first two letters and the letter corresponding to `n - 3` as the third letter.
     - This is because the sum of "a" (1) and "a" (1) is 2, so the third letter must be `n - 2` to make up the difference.
     - For example, if `n = 3`, the third letter is `alphabet[3 - 3] = alphabet[0] = 'a'`, and the word is "aaa".

4. **Checking the Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 3 (smallest possible sum) and 78 (largest possible sum).
   - For `n = 3`, the word is "aaa".
   - For `n = 78`, the word is "zzz".

5. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed word is lexicographically smallest by always starting with "a" when possible and using the smallest possible letters to make up the remaining sum.

6. **Verification**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem requirements and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
