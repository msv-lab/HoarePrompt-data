Output State: **The function should accept an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 78) representing the encoded word. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `test_cases` is a list of integers, each representing the encoded word for a test case. `alphabet` is set to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
