To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - `v` is the loop variable.
   - `na_frente` is the starting point of the range.
   - `-1` is the end point of the range.
   - `-1` is the step value.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `na_frente` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - The loop will decrement `v` by 1 each iteration, starting from `na_frente` and stopping when `v` is less than `-1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `v` must be initialized to `na_frente` for the loop to start.
   - `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1` for the loop to execute at least once.

### Given State:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- `cases` must be greater than 2.
- `c` is 2.
- `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 2.
- `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 3.
- `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `v` is -1.
- `total` is 0.
- `best` is `sys.float_info.max`.

### Adjusted State:
- `v` must be `na_frente` for the loop to start.
- `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to `-1` for the loop to execute at least once.
