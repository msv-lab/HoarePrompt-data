Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, b is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, cases is an input integer.**

The variable `cases` is assigned the value of an integer input provided by the user. The initial state for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remains unchanged.
