Output State: **`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `cases`, `c`, `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, `v`, and `best` retain their initial values, except `total` is now `total + custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.** 

The value of `total` has been increased by `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`, while all other variables remain unchanged. If `best` was initially greater than `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`, it would have been updated, but this snippet does not affect `best`. Therefore, `best` retains its initial value.
