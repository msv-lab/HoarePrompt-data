To determine what will be printed by the `print(best)` statement, let's break down the initial state and the logic step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` and `m` are integers where \(1 \leq m \leq n \leq 200,000\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `b` is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `cases` must be greater than 2.
   - `c` is 2.
   - `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to -1.
   - `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 3.
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `v` is -1.
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0.
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` ≤ `pos_final`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `na_frente` is an index that can be -1 or any non-negative integer.
   - `pos_final` is calculated as the second integer from the input minus 3. This means if the second integer is `m`, then `pos_final` is \(m - 3\).
   - `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are lists of integers provided by the user, and their lengths are `n`.

3. **Calculating `total`:**
   - `total` is the sum of the minimum values of `custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0.
   - If `na_frente` is -1, `total` will be 0 because there are no indices from -1 to 0.
   - If `na_frente` is 0, `total` will be the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[0]`.
   - If `na_frente` is a positive integer, `total` will be the sum of the minimum values from `na_frente` down to 0.

4. **Calculating `best`:**
   - `best` is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` ≤ `pos_final`.
   - This means we need to consider the range from `na_frente` to 0 and only those indices that are less than or equal to `pos_final`.

5. **Output:**
   - The `print(best)` statement will output the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all valid `i` in the range from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` ≤ `pos_final`.

Since the exact values of `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `best`. However, based on the given conditions, the output will be the calculated minimum value.

Output: **best (where best is the minimum value of `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[i]` for all `i` from `na_frente` to 0 where `i` ≤ `pos_final`)**
