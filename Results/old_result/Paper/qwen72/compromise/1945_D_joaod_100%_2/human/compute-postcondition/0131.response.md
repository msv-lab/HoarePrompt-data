Output State: **`best` is `total + custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 2]`, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 2, `c` is 2, `na_frente` must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 3, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 2`.** 

The value of `best` is updated to be the sum of `total` and the element in the list `custo_pra_trocar_a` at the index `na_frente - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
