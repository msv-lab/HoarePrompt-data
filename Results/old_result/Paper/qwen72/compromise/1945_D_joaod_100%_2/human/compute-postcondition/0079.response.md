The value of `total` is incremented by the value of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`. The value of `v` is `na_frente - 1`, so `total` is updated by adding the element at the index `na_frente - 1` from the list `custo_pra_trocar_a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 1, `c` is 1, `na_frente` is the first integer from the input minus 1 and must be greater than or equal to 0, `pos_final` is the second integer from the input minus 2, `custo_pra_trocar_a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `custo_pra_passar_b` is a list of integers provided by the user, `v` is `na_frente - 1`, `best` is `sys.float_info.max`, `total` is increased by `custo_pra_trocar_a[na_frente - 1]`.**
