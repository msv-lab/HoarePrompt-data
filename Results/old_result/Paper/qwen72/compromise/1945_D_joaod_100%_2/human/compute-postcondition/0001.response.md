The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `c` should start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000
- `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9
- `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9
- `cases` is an input integer

To ensure the loop executes, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `c` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `b` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
