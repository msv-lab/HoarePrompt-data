Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s` that must have at least three keys, `i` is the third key in `hmp`, `_` is incremented by 7, and `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m`. If `hmp[i]` < `m`, `ans` is increased by `m - hmp[i]`.***
