Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is 0.**

The code snippet `hmp = Counter(s)` updates the `hmp` variable to be a Counter object that contains the frequency of each character in the input string `s`. All other variables remain unchanged.
