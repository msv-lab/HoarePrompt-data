The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `p`. According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `p`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 'B'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the next character in `p` after 'B', which is 'C'. The string `p` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in the input string `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, `ans` is 0, `i` is 'C'. If `i` is not in `hmp`, then `i` is not in the input string `s` and `ans` is `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
