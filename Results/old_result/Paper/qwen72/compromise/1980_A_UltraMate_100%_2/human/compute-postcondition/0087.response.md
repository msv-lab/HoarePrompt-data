Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step to determine what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. `t` is greater than 0.
2. `n` is an input integer.
3. `s` is an input string.
4. `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG'.
5. `hmp` is a `Counter` object that contains the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
6. `_` is incremented by 7 for each key in `hmp`.
7. `ans` is calculated as follows:
   - `ans` is the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` multiplied by `m`.
   - Plus the sum of (`m - hmp[i]`) for each key `i` in `hmp` where `hmp[i]` is less than `m`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. **`hmp` Calculation:**
   - `hmp` is a `Counter` object that counts the frequency of each character in the input string `s`.
   - For example, if `s = "AABCC"`, then `hmp` would be `{'A': 2, 'B': 1, 'C': 2}`.

2. **`_` Calculation:**
   - `_` is incremented by 7 for each key in `hmp`.
   - If `hmp` has 3 keys (as in the example above), then `_` would be `3 * 7 = 21`.

3. **`ans` Calculation:**
   - `p` is the string 'ABCDEFG', which contains 7 unique characters.
   - We need to count how many characters in `p` are not in `hmp`.
   - For each character in `p` that is not in `hmp`, we multiply the count by `m`.
   - For each character in `p` that is in `hmp` but has a frequency less than `m`, we add `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`.

### Example Calculation:
Let's assume:
- `s = "AABCC"`, so `hmp = {'A': 2, 'B': 1, 'C': 2}`.
- `m = 3`.

1. **Characters in `p` not in `hmp`:**
   - Characters in `p` are 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'.
   - Characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` are 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'.
   - There are 4 such characters.
   - Contribution to `ans` from these characters: `4 * m = 4 * 3 = 12`.

2. **Characters in `p` that are in `hmp` but have a frequency less than `m`:**
   - Character 'A' in `p` has a frequency of 2 in `hmp`, so `m - hmp['A'] = 3 - 2 = 1`.
   - Character 'B' in `p` has a frequency of 1 in `hmp`, so `m - hmp['B'] = 3 - 1 = 2`.
   - Character 'C' in `p` has a frequency of 2 in `hmp`, so `m - hmp['C'] = 3 - 2 = 1`.
   - Contribution to `ans` from these characters: `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`.

3. **Total `ans` Calculation:**
   - `ans = 12 + 4 = 16`.

### General Calculation:
- The number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` is `7 - len(hmp)`.
- For each character in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`, the contribution is `m - hmp[i]`.

### Final Output:
The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is calculated based on the number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp` and the sum of the differences `m - hmp[i]` for each character in `hmp` that has a frequency less than `m`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the number of characters in 'ABCDEFG' that are not in hmp multiplied by m plus the sum of (m - hmp[i]) for each key i in hmp where hmp[i] < m)**
