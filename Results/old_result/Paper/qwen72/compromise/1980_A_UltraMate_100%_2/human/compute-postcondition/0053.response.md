Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s` that must have at least 2 key-value pairs, `i` is the second key in `hmp`, `_` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is the total number of characters in `p` that are not in `hmp`, each contributing `m` to the sum. If `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, `ans` is updated to `ans + (m - hmp[i])`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.***
