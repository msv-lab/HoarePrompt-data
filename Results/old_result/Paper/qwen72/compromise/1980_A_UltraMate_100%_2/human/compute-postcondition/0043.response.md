The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the string `p`. The loop iterates over each character in `p`, so the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to the next character in `p` for the loop to execute one more time. The string `p` is 'ABCDEFG', and at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 'B'. Therefore, for the next iteration, `i` should be 'C'.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` and `m` are input integers, `s` is an input string, `p` is 'ABCDEFG', `hmp` is a Counter object with the frequency of each character in `s`, `_` is incremented by 1, `i` is 'C'. If `i` is not a key in `hmp`, `ans` is set to `m`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
