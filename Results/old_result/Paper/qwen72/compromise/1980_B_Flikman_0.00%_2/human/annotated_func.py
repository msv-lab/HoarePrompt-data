#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100) representing the values shown on the cubes.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t` and `test_cases` will remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `same_value_count`, and `greater_count` will be updated and reset for each iteration of the loop. After the loop finishes, these variables will hold the values from the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input from the user to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it determines and prints whether it is possible to rearrange the cubes such that the sum of the values of any `k` consecutive cubes is at least `f`, based on the conditions: if there are at least `k` values greater than the favorite value, it prints 'YES'; if the sum of values equal to and greater than the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t` and `test_cases` (if they were defined externally) remain unchanged, while the internal variables `n`, `f`, `k`, `a`, `favorite_value`, `same_value_count`, and `greater_count` will hold the values from the last test case processed.
