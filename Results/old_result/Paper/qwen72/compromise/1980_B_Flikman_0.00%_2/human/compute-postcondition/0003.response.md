The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_i`. The constraints for `n`, `f`, and `k` are 1 ≤ f, k ≤ n ≤ 100, and for `a_i` are 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100. The function processes each test case and returns a list of results, where each result is a boolean indicating whether it is possible to rearrange the cubes such that the sum of the values of any `k` consecutive cubes is at least `f`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list of `n` integers `a_i`. The function returns a list of boolean values, where each boolean indicates whether it is possible to rearrange the cubes in the corresponding test case such that the sum of the values of any `k` consecutive cubes is at least `f`.**
