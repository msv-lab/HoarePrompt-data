Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube's value is the same as other cubes' values, and those cubes could be in positions that would affect whether the favorite cube is removed or not.

Consider the following test case:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
Here, the favorite cube is the second one with a value of 3. After sorting, the array could be:
- `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` (favorite cube in the second position, so it will be removed)
- `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` (favorite cube in the third position, so it will not be removed)

The program will output "MAYBE" for this case, which is correct. However, consider another test case:
```
5 2 3
4 3 3 2 3
```
Here, the favorite cube is the second one with a value of 3, and `k = 3`. After sorting, the array could be:
- `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` (favorite cube in the second position, so it will be removed)
- `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` (favorite cube in the third position, so it will be removed)
- `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]` (favorite cube in the fourth position, so it will not be removed)

The program will output "MAYBE" for this case, which is incorrect. The correct output should be "YES" because the favorite cube will always be removed when `k = 3` and there are at least three cubes with values greater than or equal to the favorite cube's value.
