### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Array Initialization**:
   - The array `a` is initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning to handle 1-based indexing. This is a common technique to avoid off-by-one errors.
   - The array `b` is also initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning for the same reason.

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, the program calculates a corresponding value in `b` based on the condition: if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is incremented by 2. This is done to ensure that `b[i]` is always different from `a[i]` and positive.
   - The cumulative sum of `a` is then calculated using `itertools.accumulate`. This is correct because it will help in quickly calculating the sum of any subarray of `a`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks two conditions:
     - `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]`: This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray `a[x:y]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray `b[x:y]`. This is necessary because if the sum of `a` is less than the sum of `b`, it means that `b` can be constructed such that all elements are positive and different from `a`.
     - `x == y`: If the subarray is a single element, it cannot be "good" because there is no way to construct a different positive integer `b_i` for that single element.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise. This is in line with the problem's output requirements.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. The use of cumulative sums and the conditions in the query processing are appropriate and handle the constraints and requirements of the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
