The values of `n` and `q` are assigned based on the input provided, where `n` and `q` are converted to integers. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, the function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases, each including an array `c` of length `n` with positive integers, and `q` queries with indices `l_i` and `r_i` for subarrays of `c`. The input constraints are: 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
