Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string of length `m` comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.** 

The values of `n`, `k`, and `m` remain unchanged. The variable `s` is now assigned the value of the input string, which must be of length `m` and consist only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
