The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by two lists `healths` and `positions` of length `n`. It then determines if it is possible to defeat all monsters by shooting them with bullets, where each monster's position and health are given. The function outputs 'YES' if the total number of bullets needed to defeat all monsters does not exceed the time available (which is the distance of the farthest monster), and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all `t` test cases and prints the result for each.
