The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems the function should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a tuple containing four elements: (n, k, a, x). Here, `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `x` is a list of integers. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, but given the constraints, it likely processes these test cases and returns a result based on the inputs for each case.

Since the function signature does not include any parameters, it is assumed that the function might be reading these parameters from an external source or using predefined variables within the function body. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each case, but the exact nature of the result is not provided.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a tuple (n, k, a, x), where `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of integers, and `x` is a list of integers. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.**
