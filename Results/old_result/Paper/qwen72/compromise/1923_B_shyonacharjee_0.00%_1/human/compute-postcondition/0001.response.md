The only variable in the loop head is `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it will take on the values from `range(t)` during each iteration of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
