Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers.

2. **Sorting**: The function sorts the list of integers, which is a crucial step. Sorting ensures that the smallest integers are paired together, maximizing the sum of the minimum values of each pair.

3. **Selecting Minimum Values**: The function then iterates over the sorted list and selects every other integer starting from the first one. This approach is correct because, in a sorted list, the minimum value of each pair will always be the first of the two consecutive integers.

4. **Summing and Storing Results**: The function correctly sums the selected integers and appends the result to the `out` list. This list is used to store the results for each test case.

5. **Output**: Finally, the function prints the results for each test case. This is in line with the problem's requirement to output the maximum final score for each test case.

6. **Memory Management**: The function clears the `list1` and `list2` lists after processing each test case, which is a good practice to avoid memory issues.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The execution summary also confirms that the function behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
