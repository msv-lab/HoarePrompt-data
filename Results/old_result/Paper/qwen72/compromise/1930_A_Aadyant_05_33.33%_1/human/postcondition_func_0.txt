The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) from the input, sorts the list, and computes the sum of the first, third, fifth, etc., integers from the sorted list. It then prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 5000, and the input lists remain unchanged. The `out` list contains the sums for each test case, and these sums are printed to the console.
