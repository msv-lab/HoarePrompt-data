Reasoning:

The program aims to generate a k-level permutation for each test case. A k-level permutation is defined as a permutation where the sums of all continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. The program constructs the permutation by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements in the range from 1 to n.

Let's break down the program step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - It initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It starts the permutation with the first element `[1]`.
   - It uses a list `a` to keep track of the current indices for the smallest and largest elements to be added to the permutation.

3. **Alternating Elements:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` to fill the rest of the permutation.
   - If `i` is odd, it appends the largest remaining element to the permutation and decrements the index for the largest element.
   - If `i` is even, it appends the smallest remaining element to the permutation and increments the index for the smallest element.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the constructed permutation for each test case.

### Verification of k-Level Property:
To verify if the generated permutation is k-level, we need to check the sums of all continuous segments of length k and ensure that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums is no more than 1.

- **Alternating Pattern:**
  - The program alternates between the smallest and largest elements, which helps in balancing the sums of the segments.
  - For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the permutation might look like `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`.
  - The sums of the segments of length 4 are:
    - `[1, 10, 2, 9]` -> sum = 22
    - `[10, 2, 9, 3]` -> sum = 24
    - `[2, 9, 3, 8]` -> sum = 22
    - `[9, 3, 8, 4]` -> sum = 24
    - `[3, 8, 4, 7]` -> sum = 22
    - `[8, 4, 7, 5]` -> sum = 24
    - `[4, 7, 5, 6]` -> sum = 22

- **Sum Differences:**
  - The maximum sum is 24 and the minimum sum is 22.
  - The difference is 24 - 22 = 2, which is not more than 1.

However, the program's logic for alternating elements is flawed. The condition `if (-1) ** i == -1` is incorrect because it will always alternate between the smallest and largest elements, which does not guarantee that the sums of the segments will differ by no more than 1.

### Correct Approach:
To ensure the k-level property, the permutation should be constructed in a way that balances the sums of the segments. One correct approach is to alternate between the smallest and largest elements in a more controlled manner, ensuring that the sums of the segments are as close as possible.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly ensure the k-level property for all test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
