Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and `array[a[-1]]`, and `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -3.**

Explanation:
- The code `a[-1] -= 1` decrements the last element of the list `a` by 1.
- Initially, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2.
- After the execution, the last element of `a` becomes -3.
- All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
