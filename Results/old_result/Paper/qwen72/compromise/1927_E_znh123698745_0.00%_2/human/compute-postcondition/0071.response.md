Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1, `array[2]`], `a` is [2, -1]**.

Explanation: The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value at index `a[0]` (which is 2) of the `array` to the `answer` list. Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `array[2]` is the third element of `array`, which is 3. Therefore, `answer` is updated to [1, 1, 3]. All other variables remain unchanged.
