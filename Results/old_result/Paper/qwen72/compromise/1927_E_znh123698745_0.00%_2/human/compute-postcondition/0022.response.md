Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 3, `answer` is a list containing the first element of `array`.**

Explanation:
- The code `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the element at the index `a[0]` of the `array` to the list `answer`.
- Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `a[0]` is not specified, we assume `a[0]` is 0 (the first index of the list).
- Therefore, `answer` now contains the first element of `array`, which is 1.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
