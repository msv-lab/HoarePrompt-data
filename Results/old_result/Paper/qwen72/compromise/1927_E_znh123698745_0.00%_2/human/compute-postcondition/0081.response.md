Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
   - `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1.
   - `k` is an even integer provided by the input.
   - `_` is 2.
   - `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
   - `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1, `array[2]`, `array[3]`, ..., `array[n-2]`, `array[n-1]`, `array[1]`].
   - `a` is [n, -n].

2. **Understanding the `answer` list:**
   - The `answer` list is constructed as follows:
     - The first element is 1.
     - The second element is 1.
     - The subsequent elements are taken from `array` starting from index 2 up to index `n-1`.
     - The last element is `array[1]`.

3. **Constructing the `answer` list:**
   - `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive. For example, if `n = 5`, then `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - `answer` will be constructed as:
     - First element: 1
     - Second element: 1
     - Elements from `array[2]` to `array[n-1]`: [3, 4]
     - Last element: `array[1]` which is 2
   - Therefore, `answer` will be [1, 1, 3, 4, 2].

4. **Executing the `print` statement:**
   - The `print` statement uses the `*` operator to unpack the `answer` list, which means it will print the elements of the list separated by spaces.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print` statement will print the elements of the `answer` list separated by spaces.

Output: **1 1 3 4 2 (where the elements are based on the construction of the `answer` list from the `array` list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive)**

Note: The exact elements in the `answer` list depend on the value of `n`. For a general `n`, the `answer` list will be [1, 1, 3, 4, ..., `n-1`, 2].
