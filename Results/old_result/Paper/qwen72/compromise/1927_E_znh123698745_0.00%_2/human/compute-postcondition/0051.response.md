Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 3, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and `array[a[0]]`, `a[0]` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a[0] += 1` increments the value of `a[0]` by 1.
- Initially, `a[0]` is 1, so after the increment, `a[0]` becomes 2.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
