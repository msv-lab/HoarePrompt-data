Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 1, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, `array`[-1]] if `i` is odd, otherwise `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1], and `a` is [1, -2] if `i` is odd, otherwise `a` is [2, -1].***
