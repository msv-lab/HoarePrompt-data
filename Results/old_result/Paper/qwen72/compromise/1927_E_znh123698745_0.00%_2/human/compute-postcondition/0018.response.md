Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 2. If `(-1) ** i == -1`, `a[-1]` is decreased by 1, and `answer` has been appended with the value of `array[a[-1] + 1]`. Otherwise, `answer` contains the integer at the index `array[0]` of `array`, and `array[0]` is 2.***
