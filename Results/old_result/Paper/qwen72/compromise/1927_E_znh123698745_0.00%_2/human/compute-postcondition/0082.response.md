Output State: **`t` is 0, `n` and `k` are integers provided by the input and must satisfy the initial conditions (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and k is even), `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is 0 because the loop runs `t` times, and each iteration decrements `t` implicitly.
- **`n` and `k`**: These remain the integers provided by the input and must satisfy the initial conditions (2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and k is even).
- **`array`**: This is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, which is created at the start of each test case.
- **`i`**: This is the loop variable that iterates from 1 to `n-1`, and after the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- **`answer`**: This list contains the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1. For example, if `n` is 5, `answer` will be [1, 5, 2, 4, 3].
- **`a`**: This list contains the integers `n` and `-n` after the loop completes, reflecting the final state of the indices used to construct the `answer` list.
