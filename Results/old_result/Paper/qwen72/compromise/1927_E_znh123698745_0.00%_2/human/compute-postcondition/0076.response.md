Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer, `_` is 2, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers [1, 1, `array[2]`, `array[-1]`], `a` is [3, -2].**

The value of `a[-1]` is decremented by 1, changing from -1 to -2. All other variables and their values remain unchanged.
