The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[-1]])` impacts the `answer` list by appending the value at the index `a[-1]` from the `array` list. The value of `a[-1]` is the last element of the list `a`, which in the initial state is either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]` depending on the condition. Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, the value at `array[a[-1]]` will be the integer corresponding to the index `a[-1]`.

The initial state specifies that `answer` already contains the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]` depending on the condition. After appending `array[a[-1]]` to `answer`, the list `answer` will contain the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and the value of `array[a[-1]]` twice, or 1, `array[-1]`, `array[a[0]]`, and `array[a[-1]]` depending on the condition.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 3, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and the value of `array[a[-1]]` twice, or 1, `array[-1]`, `array[a[0]]`, and `array[a[-1]]` depending on the condition.**
