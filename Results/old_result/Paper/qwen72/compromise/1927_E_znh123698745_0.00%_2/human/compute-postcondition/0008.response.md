Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1 and `n`, `a` is a list containing the integers 1 and -2, `i` is 1, and the current value of `(-1)` is -1.**

The value of `a[-1]` (which is -1) is decremented by 1, so it becomes -2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
