Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, `_` is 0, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order starting with 1, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n` and `-n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
- **`n`**: Remains an integer between 2 and 2 · 10^5.
- **`k`**: Remains an even integer between 2 and `n`.
- **`_`**: Remains 0.
- **`array`**: Remains a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop runs from 1 to `n - 1` (inclusive).
- **`answer`**: The list `answer` will contain the integers from 1 to `n` in alternating order, starting with 1. For example, if `n` is 5, `answer` will be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`.
- **`a`**: The list `a` will be modified such that `a[0]` will be `n` and `a[1]` will be `-n`. This is because the loop alternates between incrementing `a[0]` and decrementing `a[1]`, and after `n - 1` iterations, `a[0]` will have been incremented `n // 2` times and `a[1]` will have been decremented `n // 2` times. Since `n` is even, both indices will be at their respective limits.
