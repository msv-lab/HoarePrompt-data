The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`. Here, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is even.

The function returns different outputs based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case. The specific return values are not provided in the output section, but we can infer the general functionality based on the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `n` and `k` where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is even. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
