The code snippet `answer.append(array[a[0]])` appends the value of `array[a[0]]` to the list `answer`. 

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 3
- `k` is an even integer provided by the input
- `_` is 1
- `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive
- `i` is 3
- `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]` depending on the condition

Let's break down the impact of the code:
- `array[a[0]]` is the value at the index `a[0]` in the `array`.
- `answer` is updated by appending `array[a[0]]` to it.

Since `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, and `a[0]` is the first element of the list `a`, which is not explicitly defined but is assumed to be an index within the bounds of `array`, the value `array[a[0]]` is an integer between 1 and `n`.

The updated `answer` list will now contain:
- The integer 1
- The integer `array[-1]`, which is `n`
- Either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]` depending on the condition
- The integer `array[a[0]]`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `n`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]`, and now also `array[a[0]]`.**
