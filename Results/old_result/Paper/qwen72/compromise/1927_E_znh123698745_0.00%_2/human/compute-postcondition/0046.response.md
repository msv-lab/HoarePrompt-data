The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 3, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is 3, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and either `array[a[-1]]` or `array[a[0]]` depending on the condition.**
