Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an integer provided by the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is an even integer provided by the input, `_` is 1, `array` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, `answer` is a list containing the integers 1, `array[-1]`, and alternating elements from the end and start of `array` until the list is filled with `n` elements, and `a` is a list containing the integers `n // 2` and `-(n // 2)`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n - 1`, so after all iterations, `i` will be `n - 1`.
- The `answer` list starts with the integer `1` and then alternates between appending the last element of `array` and the first element of `array` (or the next elements from the end and start, respectively) until the list contains `n` elements.
- The `a` list initially contains `[1, -1]`. For each odd `i`, the last element of `array` is appended to `answer`, and `a[-1]` is decremented by 1. For each even `i`, the first element of `array` is appended to `answer`, and `a[0]` is incremented by 1. After `n - 1` iterations, `a[0]` will be `n // 2` and `a[-1]` will be `-(n // 2)`.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `_`, and `array`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
