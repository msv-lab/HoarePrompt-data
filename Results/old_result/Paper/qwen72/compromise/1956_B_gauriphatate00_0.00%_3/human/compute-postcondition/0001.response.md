Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.** 

The `data` variable now holds a list of strings, each string being a part of the input that was split by whitespace. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.
