Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is the last value of `n` processed in the loop, `a` is the last list of integers processed in the loop, `data` is the same list of strings as in the initial state, `idx` is the index after the last processed element in `data`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration of the loop.**

The loop itself does not modify the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `data`, or `idx`. It only iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged after the loop has finished executing. The `results` list, which contains the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration of the loop, is also unchanged by the loop, as the loop only reads and prints its elements.
