Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the condition `elif a == b == c:` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect outputs. If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all equal, they do not form a stair or a peak, and the program should output "NONE" without this specific check. However, the check for a peak should only consider the case where `a < b > c`, not `max(a, b, c) == b`, which can also be true for a stair or when `a` and `c` are equal but not forming a peak.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version correctly identifies stairs and peaks and outputs "NONE" for all other cases.
