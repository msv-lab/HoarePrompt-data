Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of three digits a, b, and c where 0 <= a, b, c <= 9. The number of test cases, t, is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. The function returns the result of processing each test case, but the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.**
