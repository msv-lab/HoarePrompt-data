Output State: **`x` is 0, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the lengths of the increasing subsequences that must have at least 3 elements, `mx` is the maximum length of any subsequence in `subseq_lens`, `ansv` is a list of integers from 0 to `mx-1` with the elements `subseq_lens[1]`, `subseq_lens[2]`, and `subseq_lens[3]` appended, `i` is 3.**

The code appends the element at index `3` of the list `subseq_lens` to the list `ansv`. The other variables remain unchanged.
