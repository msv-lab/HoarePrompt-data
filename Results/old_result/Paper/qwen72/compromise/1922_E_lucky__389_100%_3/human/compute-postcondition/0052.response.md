The value `i - 1` is appended to the list `subseq_lens`. The value of `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\), and since `i` is not equal to 0, `i - 1` is a non-negative integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 2, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the smallest integer such that \(2^i > x\) and `i` is not equal to 0.**
