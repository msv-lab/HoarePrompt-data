The variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`. The loop condition is `2 ** i <= x`. For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `2 ** i <= x` must still hold true after the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and not equal to 2.
- `i` is 1.

To check if the loop can execute one more time:
- The current condition is `2 ** 1 <= x`, which simplifies to `2 <= x`.
- For the loop to execute again, `i` will be incremented to 2, so the new condition will be `2 ** 2 <= x`, which simplifies to `4 <= x`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 4, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, `mx` is 0, `i` is 1**
