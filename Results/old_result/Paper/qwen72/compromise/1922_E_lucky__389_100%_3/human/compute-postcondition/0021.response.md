Output State: **`x` is reduced by `2 ** (i - 1)`, `subseq_lens` is a list containing the value `i - 1`, `mx` is 0, `i` is the largest integer such that `2^i ≤ x` before the reduction, and `i` is not equal to 0.**

Explanation:
- The value of `x` is updated by subtracting `2 ** (i - 1)` from its current value.
- The list `subseq_lens` remains unchanged and still contains the value `i - 1`.
- The variable `mx` remains 0.
- The variable `i` is still the largest integer such that `2^i ≤ x` before the reduction, and `i` is not equal to 0.
