Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1` for each one. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Base Case Handling**: For `x = 2`, the program prints `1` and `0` and returns. This is correct because an array of length 1 with a single element (0) has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing the single element.

3. **Subsequence Construction**:
   - The program uses a loop to decompose `x` into a sum of powers of 2. This is a good approach because the number of increasing subsequences in an array can be constructed using the properties of binary numbers.
   - For each power of 2 found, it appends the corresponding exponent (minus 1) to the list `subseq_lens` and subtracts the value from `x`.
   - The maximum exponent found is stored in `mx`.

4. **Array Construction**:
   - The program constructs the array `ansv` by first adding integers from 0 to `mx-1`.
   - It then appends the elements from `subseq_lens[1:]` to `ansv`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of `ansv` and then the elements of `ansv` on a single line separated by spaces.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x = 2`.
   - For other values of `x`, it constructs an array that has exactly `x` increasing subsequences by using the binary decomposition method.

7. **Constraints**:
   - The length of the array `ansv` is at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.
   - The elements of the array `ansv` are within the range [-10^9, 10^9], which is also within the problem's constraints.

8. **Logical Consistency**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed array has exactly `x` increasing subsequences by carefully selecting the elements based on the binary decomposition of `x`.

However, there is a potential issue in the program:
- **Handling of `x = 1`**: The problem description states that `X` is in the range [2, 10^18]. The program does not handle the case where `x = 1`, but this is not a problem because the input constraints guarantee that `x` will be at least 2.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be logically consistent and correctly handles the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
