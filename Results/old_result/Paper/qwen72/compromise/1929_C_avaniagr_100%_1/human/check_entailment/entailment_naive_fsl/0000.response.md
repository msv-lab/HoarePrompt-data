Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

- **Input:** `2 1 1`
- **Expected Output:** `NO`
- **Actual Output:** `NO` (The program outputs the correct result for this case, but it is not correct for all cases.)

- **Input:** `2 1 2`
- **Expected Output:** `YES`
- **Actual Output:** `NO` (The program incorrectly outputs `NO` for this case.)

In the case where `k = 2`, `x = 1`, and `a = 2`, Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins by always betting 1 coin. If he wins, he will have 3 coins, and if he loses, he will still have 1 coin left to bet again. This strategy ensures that he can always recover and eventually win any number of coins. However, the program incorrectly outputs `NO` for this case, indicating that the logic is flawed.
