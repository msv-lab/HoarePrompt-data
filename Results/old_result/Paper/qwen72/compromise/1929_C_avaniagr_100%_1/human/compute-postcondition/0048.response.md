Let's break down the initial state and the operations described to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
- `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input and must be at least \(k - 3\).
- `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input.
- `z` is the result of the expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` repeated \(x - k + 3\) times, starting with `z = k - 2`.
- `i` is \(x - k + 2\).
- The current value of `a` is greater than or equal to the current value of `z`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initialization of `z`:**
   - `z` starts with the value \(k - 2\).

2. **Repeating the Expression:**
   - The expression `z + z // (k - 1) + 1` is repeated \(x - k + 3\) times.
   - Each iteration updates `z` based on the current value of `z`.

3. **Final Value of `z`:**
   - After \(x - k + 3\) iterations, `z` will have a final value.
   - The exact value of `z` depends on the values of `k` and `x`, but it is guaranteed that `a` is greater than or equal to this final value of `z`.

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `a >= z` is satisfied, as stated in the initial state.

### Print Statement:
- The `print` statement is `print('YES')`.

### Conclusion:
Since the condition `a >= z` is explicitly stated to be true, the `print` statement will always print 'YES'.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
