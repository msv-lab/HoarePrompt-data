Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers for each test case where:
  - 2 <= k <= 30
  - 1 <= x <= 100
  - 1 <= a <= 10^9
- The input has at least 2 lines.
- `k` is the first integer from the second line of the input.
- `x` is the second integer from the second line of the input.
- `a` is the third integer from the second line of the input.
- Additionally, `x` is equal to `k - 1`, and `a` is less than `x + 2`.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **NO**
