Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
1. `z` is updated to `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`.
2. `x` is greater than `k - 1`.
3. `i` is `x - k + 3`.
4. `x - k + 3` is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
5. `a` is greater than or equal to the updated value of `z`.

### Analysis:
- **`z` Update**: The value of `z` is updated using the formula `z + (x - k + 3) * (z // (k - 1) + 1)`.
  - `x - k + 3` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, which is stored in `i`.
  - `z // (k - 1) + 1` is a term that is added to `z` for each iteration.
- **Condition on `x`**: `x` is greater than `k - 1`, which means `x - k + 3` is a positive integer.
- **Condition on `a`**: `a` is greater than or equal to the updated value of `z`.

### Code Snippet:
```
print('YES')
```

### Explanation:
- The code snippet simply prints the string `'YES'`.
- The initial state provides conditions and updates to variables, but it does not affect the content of the `print` statement directly.
- Since the `print` statement is a simple string literal, it will always print `'YES'` regardless of the values of `z`, `x`, `k`, `i`, or `a`.

### Final Output:
Output: **YES**
