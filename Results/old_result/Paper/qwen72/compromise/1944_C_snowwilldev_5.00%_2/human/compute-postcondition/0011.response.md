Output State: **`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cnt[a[i]]` is incremented by 1 for each `i` in the range from 0 to `N-1`, `i` is `N-1`, `t` is 0.**

The variable `t` is assigned the value 0. The other variables `tc`, `N`, `a`, `cnt[a[i]]`, and `i` remain unchanged from their initial state.
