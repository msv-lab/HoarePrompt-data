Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `tc` is either 2 or 3.
   - `N` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int.
   - `cnt[a[j]]` is the count of how many times the element `a[j]` appears in the list `a` for each `j` from 0 to `N-1`.
   - If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is set to 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.
   - The current value of `t` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2.
   - If `cnt[i]` is 0, then `t` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(i)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `i` is explicitly set to 0 in the initial state.
   - The value of `i` is not modified in the code snippet.
   - Therefore, the value of `i` remains 0 when the `print` statement is executed.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
