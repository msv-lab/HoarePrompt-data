To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `tc` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `tc`**: This variable is used to iterate over the range of test cases. Before the loop starts, `tc` is implicitly set to 0 by the `for` loop.
2. **Input for the range**: The loop will execute if the input provided to `range` is greater than 0. This input represents the number of test cases, `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that the input provided to `range` is at least 1 to make the loop execute.

State: **`tc` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
