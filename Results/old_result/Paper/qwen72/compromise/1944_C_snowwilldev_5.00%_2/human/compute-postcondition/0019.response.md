Postcondition: ***`tc` is 0, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is 1. If `t` is 0 and `cnt[i]` is not 0, the program continues. If `t` is greater than or equal to 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
