Postcondition: **`tc` is 1 or 2, `N` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 0, `t` is 0, and `cnt` is a defaultdict with default type int where `cnt[a[i]]` is the count of how many times each integer in `a` appeared in the list `a` from index 0 to `N-1`. The current value of `cnt[i]` is 1.**
