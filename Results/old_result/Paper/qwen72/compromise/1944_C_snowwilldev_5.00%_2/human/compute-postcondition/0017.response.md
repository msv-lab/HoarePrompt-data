Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed:

1. `tc` is 0.
2. `N` is an input integer greater than 0.
3. `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
4. `i` is 0.
5. If `cnt[i]` is 1, then `t` is 1. Otherwise, `t` remains 0.
6. The current value of `t` is either 0 or greater than or equal to 2, or the current value of `cnt[i]` is 0.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print(i)
```

- `i` is explicitly stated to be 0 in the initial state.
- The conditions provided do not change the value of `i`.

Therefore, the value of `i` when the print statement is executed is 0.

Output: **0**
