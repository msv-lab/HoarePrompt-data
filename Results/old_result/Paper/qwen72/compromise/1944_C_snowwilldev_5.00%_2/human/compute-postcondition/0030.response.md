Output State: **`tc` is 0 or 1, `N` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.** 

The values of `tc`, `N`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, but the `break` statement causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is currently in.
