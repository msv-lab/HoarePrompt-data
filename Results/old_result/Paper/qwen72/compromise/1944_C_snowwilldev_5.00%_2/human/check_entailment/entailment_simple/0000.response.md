### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that runs `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Counting Elements**: The function uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`. This is a correct approach to keep track of how many times each element appears.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Goal**: Alice wants to maximize the MEX of the array `c` by choosing elements that are not already in `c` or that appear only once in `a`.
   - **Bob's Goal**: Bob wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c` by choosing elements that are not already in `c` or that appear only once in `a`.

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `N-1`.
   - For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `cnt[i]` (the count of `i` in `a`) is 1. If it is, it increments `t` by 1.
   - If `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0, the loop breaks and prints `i`. This is because:
     - If `t` reaches 2, it means Alice and Bob have both chosen elements that appear only once, and the next smallest integer `i` will not be in `c` because it either appears more than once or not at all.
     - If `cnt[i]` is 0, it means the integer `i` is not in `a` at all, and thus it will be the MEX of `c`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same, as it will print the smallest integer that is not in `a`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the MEX of `c` for each test case, which is the correct output format.

### Correctness:
Based on the reasoning above, the program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob, and it handles all edge cases and input constraints as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
