You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving multiple test cases, each with the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. The input for each test case includes `n`, `m`, and `k` as integers, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`, `0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)`, and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2 * 10^5`. Additionally, for each of the `m` pairs, there are three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i` representing the indices of the children in the pair and their initial friendship value, with `1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n`, `a_i ≠ b_i`, and `1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9`. The function should handle up to `5 * 10^4` test cases, with the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases not exceeding `10^5` and the sum of `k` not exceeding `2 * 10^5`.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        M = 10 ** 9 + 7
        
        c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)
        
        s = 0
        
        a = 0
        
        for i in range(m):
            u, v, f = map(int, input().split())
            a += f
        
        for i in range(k):
            s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a
        
        print(s % M)
        
    #State: The function will print the result of `s % M` for each test case, where `s` is the cumulative sum of the expression `s + c * i * c * m + c * a` over `k` iterations, and `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` will be reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables for each test case will be the state immediately after the last iteration of the inner `k` loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list of `m` pairs of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`. It returns the results of processing these test cases, which involve handling the specified number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, while adhering to the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
