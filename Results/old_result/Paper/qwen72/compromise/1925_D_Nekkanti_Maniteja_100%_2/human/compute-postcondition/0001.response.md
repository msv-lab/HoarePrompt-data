Output State: **The function will print the result of `s % M` for each test case, where `s` is the cumulative sum of the expression `s + c * i * c * m + c * a` over `k` iterations, and `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 2` modulo `10^9 + 7`. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `M`, `c`, `s`, and `a` will be reset for each test case, and the final state of these variables for each test case will be the state immediately after the last iteration of the inner `k` loop.**
