Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they can be placed on a single screen, but the remaining 1x1 icons cannot fit on the same screen. For example, consider the input `x = 11` and `y = 1`. According to the program, the output is `1`, but the correct output should be `2` because one 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and 11 1x1 icons cannot all fit into the remaining 11 cells (since the screen size is 15 cells, and the 2x2 icon leaves only 11 cells available, but 11 1x1 icons would require 11 cells, which is exactly the remaining space, but the 2x2 icon cannot be placed in a way that leaves all 11 cells available for 1x1 icons).

The program incorrectly assumes that the 1x1 icons can always fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons, without considering the actual placement constraints of the 2x2 icons.
