You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math

func_1()

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `ap` from the user, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user. Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it calculates and prints a value based on the following rules: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of `math.ceil(y / 2)` and `math.ceil((x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4) / 15)` (if the result is positive); if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`; if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`; if both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The values of `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration, but their final state depends on the last input provided. The value of `ap` remains unchanged throughout the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of 2x2 icons is such that they can be placed on a single screen, but the remaining 1x1 icons cannot fit on the same screen. For example, consider the input `x = 11` and `y = 1`. According to the program, the output is `1`, but the correct output should be `2` because one 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and 11 1x1 icons cannot all fit into the remaining 11 cells (since the screen size is 15 cells, and the 2x2 icon leaves only 11 cells available, but 11 1x1 icons would require 11 cells, which is exactly the remaining space, but the 2x2 icon cannot be placed in a way that leaves all 11 cells available for 1x1 icons).

The program incorrectly assumes that the 1x1 icons can always fit into the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons, without considering the actual placement constraints of the 2x2 icons.
