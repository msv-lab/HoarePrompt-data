Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `ap` from the user, which specifies the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user. Depending on the values of `x` and `y`, it calculates and prints a value based on the following rules: if both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of `math.ceil(y / 2)` and `math.ceil((x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4) / 15)` (if the result is positive); if `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`; if `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`; if both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The values of `x` and `y` are updated in each iteration, but their final state depends on the last input provided. The value of `ap` remains unchanged throughout the function. **
