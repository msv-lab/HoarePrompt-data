To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `t` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. **Variable `t`**: The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This means `t` is already within a valid range for the loop to execute at least once if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

2. **Input Value**: The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. If `int(input())` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Loop Initialization**: The loop initializes `t` to 0 and increments it by 1 for each iteration. Therefore, `t` should start at 0 for the loop to execute correctly.

Given these points, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is greater than 0 and `t` is initialized to 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
