The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the input. The function then counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a` and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program is such that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string, and `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the last processed string `a`.
