Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is a new input integer, `a` is a new input string, `ans` is 0, `i` is the index just past the last character of the last 3-character substring checked, which is `len(a) - 2` or less, `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the value provided by `int(input())`.** 

The code snippet `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0, which is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
