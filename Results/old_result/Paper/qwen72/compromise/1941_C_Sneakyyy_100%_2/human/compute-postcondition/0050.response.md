The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` could be 2, 3, or 4 based on the initial conditions. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be 3, 4, or 5, respectively. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The condition that `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3 or 4, or greater than 4 if `i` is 2, is still valid, but now it must be greater than 6 if `i` is 4 or 5, or greater than 5 if `i` is 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i-1` and of length 3, if `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 2 and `i` is 4, otherwise if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' and `i-1` is 4, `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5, if `s` is not 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3, `len(a)` must be greater than 6 if `i` is 4 or 5, or greater than 5 if `i` is 3.**
