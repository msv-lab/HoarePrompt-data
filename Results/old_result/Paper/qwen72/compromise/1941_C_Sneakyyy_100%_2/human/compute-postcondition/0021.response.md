Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`, `i` is either 9, 7, or 5, `ans` is either 2, 1, or 0, and `len(a)` must be greater than `i + 2`.** 

The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so if `i` was 6, it is now 9; if `i` was 4, it is now 7; and if `i` was 2, it is now 5. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
