Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is an input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (inclusive), `i` is 3 if `s` was initially 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1, `ans` is 1 if `s` was initially 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `s` is now the substring of `a` from index `i` to `i + 2`.**
