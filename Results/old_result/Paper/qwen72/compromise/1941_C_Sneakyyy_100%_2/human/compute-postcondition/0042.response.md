Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string with length greater than 2, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and of length 3, `ans` is 1 if `s` is 'map' or 'pie' and `i` is 3, otherwise `ans` is 0 and `i` is 4. `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3, or greater than 3 if `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `i` is incremented by 3.
- If the initial value of `i` was 1, it is now 4.
- If the initial value of `i` was 3, it is now 6.
- The conditions for `len(a)` are still valid: `len(a)` must be greater than 5 if `i` is 3 (now 6), or greater than 3 if `i` is 1 (now 4).
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `s`, `ans`) remain unchanged.
