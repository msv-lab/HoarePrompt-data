You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Output

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                i += 3
                ans += 1
            else:
                i += 1
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` from the input. The function then counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in `a` and prints this count. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program is such that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is the last input integer, `a` is the last input string, and `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the last processed string `a`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for incrementing `i` and `ans` is flawed. When a substring "map" or "pie" is found, the program increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1. However, this approach fails to account for overlapping substrings and does not correctly calculate the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

For example, consider the input string "ppiepieeee". The program will find the first "pie" and increment `i` by 3, then it will find the second "pie" and increment `i` by 3 again. This results in `ans` being 2, but the correct answer should be 0 because the string is already beautiful.

Another example is the input string "mappie". The program will find "map" and increment `i` by 3, then it will find "pie" and increment `i` by 3 again. This results in `ans` being 2, but the correct answer should be 1 because removing the 'p' at index 3 will make the string beautiful.

The program needs to be revised to correctly handle overlapping substrings and to ensure that the minimum number of deletions is calculated accurately.
