Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have at least 2 characters, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `j` is 1. If the second character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `counter` is 3. Otherwise, if the second character of `a` is '0' and the first character of `b` is '1', the loop continues and `counter` is 1. If neither of these conditions is met, the loop breaks and `counter` is 2.***
