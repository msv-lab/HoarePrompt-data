Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `ans` is a string that contains the characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the final condition of the loop, `j` is the last index of `a` that was checked (i.e., `len(a) - 2`), `counter` is the number of consecutive matches between `a[j+1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.**

The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer input by the user. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, `j`, `counter`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions with the updated value of `n`.
