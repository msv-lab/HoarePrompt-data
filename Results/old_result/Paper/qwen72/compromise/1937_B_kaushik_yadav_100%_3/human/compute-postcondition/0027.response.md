Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`, `work` is False, `ans` is now equal to the first character of `b` plus the second character of `a`.**

Explanation:
- `ans` was initially equal to the first character of `b`.
- The code `ans += a[i]` appends the second character of `a` (since `i` is 1) to `ans`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
