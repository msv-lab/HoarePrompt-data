Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` and `b` are the new input strings after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is a string that contains characters from `a` and `b` based on the loop logic, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `work` is either True or False depending on the last comparison, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met.**
