Output State: **The function is set to read input from `stdin` using the `readline` method. The initial state remains unchanged except for the method used to read input. The function will still accept multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `t` is now assigned the value of an integer read from `stdin` using the `readline` method.**
