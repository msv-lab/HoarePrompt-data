Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is the input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must have a length greater than 0, `b` is the new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace, `i` is 1, `i + 1` is less than `len(a)`, `work` is False, `ans` is now equal to the first character of `b` plus the second character of `a` plus the second character of `b`.** 

Explanation: The code `ans += b[i]` appends the second character of the string `b` to the existing value of `ans`. The existing value of `ans` is the first character of `b` plus the second character of `a`. After this operation, `ans` is updated to include the second character of `b` as well. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
