The function `func` accepts multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), representing the number of columns in a 2 × n grid, followed by two binary strings of length `n`, representing the top and bottom rows of the grid. The function returns a tuple containing the lexicographically smallest string attainable by any path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell of the grid, and the number of such paths. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
