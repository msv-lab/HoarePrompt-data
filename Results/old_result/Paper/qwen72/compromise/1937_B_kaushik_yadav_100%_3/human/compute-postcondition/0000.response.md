Output State: **The function is set to read input from `stdin` using the `readline` method. The initial state remains unchanged except for the method used to read input. The function should still accept multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and two binary strings of length `n`. The function will return the lexicographically smallest string attainable by any path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell and the number of such paths. The number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.**
