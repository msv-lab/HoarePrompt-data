Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is the string `a[0]`, `i` is 0, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met, `work` is True, and `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`.**
