Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and is not adjusted, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `b` is a new input string after stripping leading and trailing whitespace and must be non-empty, `ans` is the string `a[0]` or `a[0] + b[0]`, `i` is 0 or 1, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `counter` is the number of consecutive characters from `a` and `b` that match the conditions in the loop, or 1 if the loop encountered a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b` at any point, or the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement if the conditions were not met. If `(i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1])` is true, `work` is False. Otherwise, `work` is True, and if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is `a[0] + b[0]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i + 1` is not equal to `len(a)`, `i` is incremented to 1.***
