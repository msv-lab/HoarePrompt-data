Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Path Construction**:
   - The program constructs the lexicographically smallest string by always choosing the top row (`a`) until it finds a position where the bottom row (`b`) has a smaller value. Then, it switches to the bottom row and continues.
   - However, this approach does not always yield the lexicographically smallest string. The correct approach should consider the entire path and make decisions based on the lexicographical order of the entire string, not just the next immediate cell.

2. **Path Count Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string by counting the number of positions where the top and bottom rows have the same value (`a[j + 1] == b[j]`).
   - This is incorrect because it does not account for the actual paths that can be taken to reach the bottom-right cell while maintaining the lexicographical order.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Find the Lexicographically Smallest String**:
   - Start from the top-left cell and move right or down, always choosing the path that results in the smallest possible string.
   - If both the top and bottom cells are the same, you can choose either path. If they differ, choose the path with the smaller value.

2. **Count the Number of Paths**:
   - After constructing the lexicographically smallest string, count the number of ways to reach the bottom-right cell while following the constructed string.
   - This can be done by keeping track of the number of choices at each step where the top and bottom rows have the same value.

### Example of Correct Solution:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        
        # Construct the lexicographically smallest string
        ans = a[0]
        i = 0
        while i < n - 1:
            if a[i + 1] < b[i + 1]:
                ans += a[i + 1]
                i += 1
            elif b[i + 1] < a[i + 1]:
                ans += b[i + 1]
                i += 1
            else:
                ans += a[i + 1]
                i += 1
        ans += b[n - 1]
        
        print(ans)
        
        # Count the number of paths that yield the smallest string
        counter = 1
        for j in range(n - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            elif a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
            else:
                break
        
        print(counter)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **String Construction**:
   - The program starts by adding the first character of the top row to the result string.
   - It then iterates through the grid, comparing the next character in the top row with the next character in the bottom row.
   - If the top row character is smaller, it adds the top row character to the result.
   - If the bottom row character is smaller, it adds the bottom row character to the result.
   - If they are the same, it adds the top row character and continues.

2. **Path Count**:
   - The program initializes a counter to 1, representing the initial path.
   - It then iterates through the grid, checking if the next character in the top row is the same as the current character in the bottom row.
   - If they are the same, it increments the counter.
   - If the top row character is '0' and the bottom row character is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
   - If the characters differ and the top row character is '1', it breaks the loop.

This approach ensures that the lexicographically smallest string is correctly constructed and the number of paths that yield this string is accurately counted.
