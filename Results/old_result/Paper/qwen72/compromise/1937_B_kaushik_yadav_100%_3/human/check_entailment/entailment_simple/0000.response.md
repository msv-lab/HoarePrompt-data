### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Path Construction:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the lexicographically smallest path.
   - It uses a boolean variable `work` to determine whether to follow the top row (`a`) or the bottom row (`b`).
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the strings `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
     - If the next character in `b` is lexicographically smaller than the next character in `a`, it switches to the bottom row by setting `work` to `False`.
     - If the loop reaches the end of the string, it appends the last character from `b` and breaks the loop.
     - Otherwise, it increments the index `i`.

3. **Path Counting:**
   - The program initializes a counter `counter` to 1.
   - It iterates over the indices of the strings `a` and `b` to count the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string:
     - If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, it increments the counter.
     - If `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
     - If neither of the above conditions is met, it breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans`.
   - It prints the number of paths that yield this string, stored in `counter`.

### Analysis:

- **Path Construction:**
  - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string is correct. It ensures that the grasshopper follows the top row as long as it is lexicographically smaller or equal to the bottom row, and switches to the bottom row if it finds a lexicographically smaller character in `b`.
  - The loop correctly handles the end of the string by appending the last character from `b` if necessary.

- **Path Counting:**
  - The logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is also correct. It counts the number of consecutive matches between `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` before the loop breaks or completes.
  - The counter is reset to 1 if the grasshopper encounters a '0' in `a` and a '1' in `b`, which is the correct behavior because it indicates a new potential path.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. The input handling, path construction, and path counting are all implemented correctly according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
