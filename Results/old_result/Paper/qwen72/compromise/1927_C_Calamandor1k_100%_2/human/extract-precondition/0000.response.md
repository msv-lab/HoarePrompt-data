Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even), followed by two lists of integers a and b (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) representing the arrays a and b, respectively. The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.**
