Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple in `cases` contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b`. The function evaluates each tuple to determine if the conditions are met: specifically, it checks if the number of unique elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and not shared between the two lists does not exceed `k // 2`, and if the total number of distinct elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is at least `k`. The function returns a list of strings, `results`, where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions were met for each tuple. The length of `results` is equal to the number of tuples in `cases`. **
