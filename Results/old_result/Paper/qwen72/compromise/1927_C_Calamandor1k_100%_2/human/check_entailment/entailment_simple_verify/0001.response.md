### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the elements of arrays `a` and `b`.
   - These values are stored in a list of tuples `cases` for further processing.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of the program before the function call is as described. `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, and `cases` is a list of tuples with valid inputs.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case one by one.
   - It converts the arrays `a` and `b` to sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to remove duplicates and facilitate set operations.
   - It then creates sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` containing only the elements from `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k`.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` are correctly formed, and the sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` are correctly filtered to include only elements â‰¤ `k`.

3. **Set Operations**:
   - `only_a` is the set of elements that are in `relevant_a` but not in `relevant_b`.
   - `only_b` is the set of elements that are in `relevant_b` but not in `relevant_a`.
   - `both` is the set of elements that are in both `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The set operations are correctly performed, and the sets `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both` are accurately computed.

4. **Conditions for Validity**:
   - If the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` that are not in `b`, so the function appends 'NO' to the results.
   - Similarly, if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `b` that are not in `a`, so the function appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If the total number of distinct elements in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` (i.e., `len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)`) is less than `k`, it means there are not enough unique elements to cover all integers from 1 to `k`, so the function appends 'NO' to the results.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it means it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array to cover all integers from 1 to `k`, so the function appends 'YES' to the results.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The conditions and logic are correctly implemented. The program checks the necessary conditions to ensure that all integers from 1 to `k` can be covered by selecting `k // 2` elements from each array.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which are stored in the `results` list.
   - **Annotation Verification**: The state of `results` is as described, and the program correctly prints the results.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included. The conditions and set operations used are appropriate and cover all necessary cases. The annotations confirm that the program's state and behavior are as expected at each key point.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.

Final: **True**
