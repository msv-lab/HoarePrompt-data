Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each test case contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9) in ascending order, m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5) queries, and each query consists of two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n; x_i ≠ y_i). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. For each city, the closest city is unique.**
