Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. If `m` is less than either `a` or `b`, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained or modified in the function's state. The function does not return any value. **
