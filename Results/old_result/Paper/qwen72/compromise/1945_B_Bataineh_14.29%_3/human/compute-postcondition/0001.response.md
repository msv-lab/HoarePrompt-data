The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which already ensures that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
