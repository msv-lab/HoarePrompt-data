Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it does not consider the overlap of the visibility periods of fireworks launched by the two installations. The program simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds 2, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 4 10
```
The program will output:
```
10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7
```
However, the correct output should be 4, because the visibility periods of the fireworks launched by the two installations overlap as follows:
- Fireworks from the first installation are visible at times: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
- Fireworks from the second installation are visible at times: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]

The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 4, which occurs at times 4, 5, 6, and 7. The program's logic does not account for this overlap, leading to an incorrect result.
