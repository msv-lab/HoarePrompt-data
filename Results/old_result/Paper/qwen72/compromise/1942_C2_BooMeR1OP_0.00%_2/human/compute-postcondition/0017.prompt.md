You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen. For example: `def func_1(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5) representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func_1():
    n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = [(num - 1) for num in a]
    a.sort()
    present = set(a)
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(x):
        t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
        
        t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
        
        if t1 not in present and t2 in present:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: `n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `(a[i] + 1) % n not in present and (a[i] + 2) % n in present` is true for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1`.
    gaps = []
    for i in range(x):
        next_elem = a[(i + 1) % x] + (n if i == x - 1 else 0)
        
        gap = next_elem - a[i] - 1
        
        if gap > 0:
            gaps.append(gap)
        
    #State: Output State: `n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `(a[i] + 1) % n not in present and (a[i] + 2) % n in present` is true for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1`. `gaps` is a list containing the positive differences between consecutive elements in `a` (with the last element considering the wrap-around if `i == x - 1`), where each difference is `next_elem - a[i] - 1` and `next_elem` is `a[(i + 1) % x] + n` if `i == x - 1` and `a[(i + 1) % x]` otherwise.
    gaps.sort()
    for gap in gaps:
        pairs = gap // 2
        
        if y >= pairs:
            ans += gap
            y -= pairs
        else:
            ans += 2 * y
            break
        
    #State: `n`, `x`, `y` remain unchanged. `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the sum of all `gap` values in `gaps` that are fully consumed by the loop (i.e., `y >= pairs`), plus `2 * y` for the last partial consumption of `gap` (if any).
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of all fully consumed gap values in gaps plus 2 * y for the last partial consumption of gap, if any)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. It returns the number of ways to choose up to `y` additional vertices from the remaining vertices of an `n`-sided polygon, such that the chosen vertices (including Bessie's `x` chosen vertices) form a convex polygon.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
