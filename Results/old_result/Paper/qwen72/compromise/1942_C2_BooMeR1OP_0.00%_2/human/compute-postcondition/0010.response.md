Output State: `n`, `x`, `y`, `t`, `chosen_vertices`, `a`, and `present` remain unchanged. `ans` is incremented by the number of times the condition `(a[i] + 1) % n not in present and (a[i] + 2) % n in present` is true for all `i` from 0 to `x - 1`. `gaps` is a list containing the positive differences between consecutive elements in `a` (considering `a` as circular, i.e., `a[x]` is `a[0] + n`), minus one.
