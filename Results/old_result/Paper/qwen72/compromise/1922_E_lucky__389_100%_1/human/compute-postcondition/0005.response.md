The `print(0)` statement will print the integer 0. The precondition provides information about the variables `x`, `subseq_lens`, and `mx`, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. The value 0 is explicitly provided in the `print` statement, so it will be printed directly.

Output: **0**
