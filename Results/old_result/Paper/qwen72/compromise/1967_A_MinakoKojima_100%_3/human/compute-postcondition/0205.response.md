Output State: **`ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case, and all other initial conditions remain unchanged.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ans_list` will contain the final `ans` value for each test case. The `ans` value for each test case is calculated based on the sorted list `a`, the integer `k`, and the number of unique elements in `a`. The loop processes each test case independently, and for each test case, it updates the `ans` value by distributing the `k` value among the elements of `a` in a specific way. Once the loop finishes processing all test cases, `ans_list` will have the final `ans` values for each of them. All other initial conditions, such as the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` for each test case, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop's execution.
