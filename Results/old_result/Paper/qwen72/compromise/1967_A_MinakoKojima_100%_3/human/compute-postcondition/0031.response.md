The value of `res` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is either `n - 2` or `n - 1`, depending on the value of `dif`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` was `n - 2` and is now `n - 3`. If `dif` is 0, `res` was `n - 1` and is now `n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `k` is 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`. If `dif` is not 0, `res` is `n - 3`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`.**
