Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is either `a[0]` or `a[0] + dif + k // 2`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is greater than 1, `dif` is `a[2] - a[1]`, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - k // 2` if `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than 0, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `res` is `n - 2` if `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, otherwise `res` is `n - 3`.**
