Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `a[0]`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `res` is `n - 1`, `i` is 0, `dif` is `a[1] - a[0]`**

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, but the variable `dif` is now assigned the value of the difference between the second element and the first element of the sorted list `a`.
