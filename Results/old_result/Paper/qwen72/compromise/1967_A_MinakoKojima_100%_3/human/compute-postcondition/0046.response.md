Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 3`.** 

The value of `dif` is updated to `a[3] - a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `dif` is 0, `res` is set to `n - 2`. Otherwise, `res` is set to `n - 3`.
