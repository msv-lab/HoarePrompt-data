Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer provided by the user input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `dif` is `a[3] - a[2]`, `ans` is `ans + dif`. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 4`.** 

The value of `ans` is updated by adding `dif` to it. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. If `dif` is 0, `res` is `n - 3`. Otherwise, `res` is `n - 4`.
