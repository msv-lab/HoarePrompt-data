The function `func` should accept the following parameters:
- `t`: an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `k`: two integers for each test case, where `n` represents the number of distinct types of cards (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and `k` represents the number of coins (0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12).
- `a`: a list of integers of length `n`, where each element `a_i` represents the number of cards of each type (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12).

The function should return a list of results, one for each test case, where each result indicates the maximum number of cards that can be bought with `k` coins, given the number of distinct types of cards and the number of cards of each type.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. It returns a list of results, one for each test case, indicating the maximum number of cards that can be bought with `k` coins, given the number of distinct types of cards `n` and the number of cards of each type `a`.**
