Output State: **`a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0, and `res` remains unchanged.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by `res`, while the other variables (`a`, `ans_list`, `n`, `k`, and `res`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
