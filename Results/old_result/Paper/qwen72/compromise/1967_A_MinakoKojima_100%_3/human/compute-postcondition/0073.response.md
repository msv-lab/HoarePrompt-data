Output State: **`a` is now a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is `a[0]`, `ans_list` contains `ans`, `n` and `k` are input integers, `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1, `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res` is no longer the value of `ans`.**

Explanation:
- `a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user.
- `ans` is now assigned the value of the first element in the list `a`, which is `a[0]`.
- `ans_list` still contains the value of `ans`, but `ans` has been updated to `a[0]`.
- `n` and `k` remain as input integers.
- `res` is still the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1.
- The previous expression for `ans` (`ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res`) is no longer valid for `ans`.
