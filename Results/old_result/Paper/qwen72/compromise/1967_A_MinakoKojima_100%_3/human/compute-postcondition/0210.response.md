The only objects in the loop head are the variable `a` and the list `ans_list`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `ans_list`. If `ans_list` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case and must have at least two elements, and `a` is the second element in `ans_list`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans_list` must have at least three elements, and `a` will be the third element in `ans_list`.

State: **`ans_list` contains the final `ans` value for each test case and must have at least three elements, `a` is the third element in `ans_list`**
