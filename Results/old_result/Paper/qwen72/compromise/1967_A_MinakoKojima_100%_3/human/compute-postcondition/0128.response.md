Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, `dif` is equal to `a[3] - a[2]`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is 0, `ans` and `k` remain unchanged, `res` is unchanged, and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `dif * 3`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1, and `k` is decreased by `dif * 3`. If `dif` is not 0 and `k` is less than `dif * 3`, `ans` is increased by `k // 3`, `res` is increased by `k % 3`, and `k` is set to 0, breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `dif` is 0, `res` is decreased by 1 regardless of the value of `k`.***
