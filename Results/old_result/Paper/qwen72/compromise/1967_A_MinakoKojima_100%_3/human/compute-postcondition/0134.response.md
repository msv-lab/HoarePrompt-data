Output State: **`a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0, and `res` remains unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `ans` is updated to `ans + (ans - 1) * (n - 1)`.
- The values of `a`, `ans_list`, `n`, `k`, and `res` remain unchanged.
- Since `k` is 0, the conditions for updating `ans` and `res` based on `k` do not apply, and they remain as they were in the initial state.
