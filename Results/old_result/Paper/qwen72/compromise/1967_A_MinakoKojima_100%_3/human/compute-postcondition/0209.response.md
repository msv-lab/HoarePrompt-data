Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans_list` is a list that contains the final `ans` value for each test case and must have at least two elements.
- `a` is the second element in `ans_list`.

When the `print(a)` statement is executed, it will print the second element of the `ans_list`.

Output: **a (where a is the second element in the `ans_list`)**
