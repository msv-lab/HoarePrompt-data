Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again, `dif` is equal to `a[3] - a[2]`, `ans` is increased by `dif`, `res` is decreased by 1, `k` is decreased by `dif * 3`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is decreased by 1.
- The values of `i`, `n`, `dif`, `ans`, and `k` remain unchanged, but the value of `res` is now `res - 1`.
- The conditions for `n` and the expressions for `dif`, `ans`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state.
