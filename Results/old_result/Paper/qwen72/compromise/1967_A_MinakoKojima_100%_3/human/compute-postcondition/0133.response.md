Postcondition: ***`a` remains a sorted list of integers provided by the user, `ans` is the final value after all iterations, `ans_list` contains `a[0]`, `n` is the input integer, `k` is 0. If `k` is not 0, then `ans` is updated to `ans + k // n` and `res` is updated to `res + k % n`. Otherwise, `ans` and `res` remain unchanged.***
