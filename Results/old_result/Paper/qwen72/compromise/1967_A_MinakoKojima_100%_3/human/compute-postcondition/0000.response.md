Output State: **`ans_list` is an empty list, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `a` is a list of length `n` containing integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.**
