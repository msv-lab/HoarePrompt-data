Output State: **`ans` is now `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, where `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1. `ans_list` contains `ans`. All other initial conditions remain unchanged.** 

The value of `ans` is appended to `ans_list`, and the value of `ans` is still `ans_initial + (ans_initial - 1) * (n - 1) + res`, where `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` minus 1. No other variables are affected.
