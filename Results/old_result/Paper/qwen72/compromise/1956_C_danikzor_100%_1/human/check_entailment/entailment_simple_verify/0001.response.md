### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - We can perform Type 1 and Type 2 operations, which involve setting a row or a column to a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since we are filling each row and each column with this permutation, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - However, the provided program uses the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) to calculate the maximum sum. This formula is indeed incorrect for the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Operations:**
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is assigned the maximum possible value from the permutation, which is \( n \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations, which are correctly formatted and within the allowed limit.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - The function `func_1` is called for each test case.
  - The function reads the integer \( n \) for the current test case.

- **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
  - The program calculates the maximum sum using the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \).
  - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

- **Operations:**
  - The program correctly performs \( 2n \) operations.
  - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
  - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

- **Output:**
  - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
  - It then prints the operations, which are correctly formatted and within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong formula to calculate the maximum sum. The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

Final: **False**
