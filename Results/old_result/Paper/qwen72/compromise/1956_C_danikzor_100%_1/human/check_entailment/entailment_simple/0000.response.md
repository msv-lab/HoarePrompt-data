Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum sum of the matrix as `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers squared, which is correct for the problem's requirements.
   - The program also correctly outputs `2 * n` as the number of operations, which is within the allowed limit of no more than `2n` operations.

3. **Operation Execution**:
   - The program performs `2 * n` operations, which is the maximum allowed.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, it performs two operations:
     - **Type 1 operation**: Assigns the permutation `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (in descending order) to the `i`-th row.
     - **Type 2 operation**: Assigns the permutation `p_1, p_2, ..., p_n` (in descending order) to the `i`-th column.
   - This ensures that each row and each column of the matrix contains the permutation `n, n-1, ..., 1`, which maximizes the sum of the matrix.

4. **Matrix Sum**:
   - The sum of the matrix after these operations is indeed `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`. This can be verified by noting that each element in the matrix will be one of the numbers from 1 to `n`, and each number will appear exactly `n` times in the matrix.

5. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases `t` and calling `func_1()` for each test case.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program works for the smallest possible matrix size `n = 1`, where the sum is 1 and only one operation is needed.
   - It also works for larger matrices up to `n = 500`, as the operations are performed in a consistent and correct manner.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
