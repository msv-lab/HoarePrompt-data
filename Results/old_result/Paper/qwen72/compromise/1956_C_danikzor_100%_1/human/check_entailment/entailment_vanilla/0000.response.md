### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We have an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since we are filling each row and each column with this permutation, the total sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - However, the provided program uses a different formula: \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \). This formula is incorrect for the maximum sum. The correct formula should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Operations:**
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, which is within the allowed limit.
   - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is assigned the maximum possible value from the permutation, which is \( n \).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations, which are correctly formatted and within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it uses the wrong formula to calculate the maximum sum. The correct formula for the maximum sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

Correctness: **False**
