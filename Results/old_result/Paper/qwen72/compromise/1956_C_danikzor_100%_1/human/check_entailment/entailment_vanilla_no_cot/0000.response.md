Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program aims to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. However, the program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible sum and the operations it performs do not achieve the maximum sum.

1. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula used in the program to calculate the maximum sum is \( \text{sum} = \frac{n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1)}{6} \).
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix where each element is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n \times \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{n^2 \times (n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Operations**:
   - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, where each operation assigns the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) to either a row or a column.
   - This does not maximize the sum. To maximize the sum, each element in the matrix should be the maximum possible value, which is \( n \). However, the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \) does not ensure that all elements are maximized.

### Correct Solution:
To maximize the sum of the matrix, you should use the permutation \( [n, n, \ldots, n] \) for both row and column operations. This ensures that each element in the matrix is \( n \), leading to the maximum possible sum.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * n * (n + 1) // 2
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *([n] * n))
        print(2, i, *([n] * n))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
  - The correct maximum sum is \( \frac{n^2 \times (n + 1)}{2} \).
- **Operations**:
  - The program performs \( 2n \) operations, where each operation assigns the permutation \( [n, n, \ldots, n] \) to a row or a column.
  - This ensures that every element in the matrix is \( n \), thus maximizing the sum.

By using this corrected approach, the program will correctly maximize the sum of the matrix and provide the required operations.
