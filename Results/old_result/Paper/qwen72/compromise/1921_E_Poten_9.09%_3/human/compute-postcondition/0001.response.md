Output State: **`test_cases` is an input integer, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9`, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`. `answers` is an empty list.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `answers` is now an empty list.
