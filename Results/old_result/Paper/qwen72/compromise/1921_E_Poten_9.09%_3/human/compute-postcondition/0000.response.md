The value of `test_cases` is assigned the integer value of the input provided. The function `func` and its intended parameters remain unchanged and the constraints on the parameters are still valid. The output state is: `test_cases` is an input integer, `1 <= t <= 10^4`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9`, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`.
