You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the position of the card to be determined. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own `n` and `k` values, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        m = 1
        
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `n` and `k` from the input, perform a series of calculations, and print the result of `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`. The variables `s` and `m` will be reset to 0 and 1, respectively, at the beginning of each iteration. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` will be undefined or reset for the next test case, but the number of test cases `t` will remain as specified in the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cards, and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing the position of the card to be determined. It processes multiple test cases, each defined by `n` and `k`, with the number of test cases `t` being a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, the function returns the determined position of the card.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
