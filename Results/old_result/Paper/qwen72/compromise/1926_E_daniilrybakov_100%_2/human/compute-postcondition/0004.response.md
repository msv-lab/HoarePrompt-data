Functionality: ** The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` represents the number of cards and `k` represents the position of the card to be determined, with 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The function then performs a series of calculations to determine the final position of the card and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the output for each test case is printed to the console. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `s`, and `m` are reset or redefined in each iteration, and their final state is undefined after the function concludes. **
