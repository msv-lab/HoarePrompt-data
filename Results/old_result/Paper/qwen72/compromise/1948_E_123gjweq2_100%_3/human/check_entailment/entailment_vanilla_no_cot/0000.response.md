Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function Call in `func_1`**:
   - The function `make_array` is called with the arguments `i * k`, `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, and `i + 1`. However, the `make_array` function is not defined with these exact parameters. The function `make_array` expects `left`, `right`, and `clique` as arguments, but the `right` argument in `func_1` is calculated as `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, which might not be the correct way to determine the `right` boundary for the `make_array` function.

2. **Indexing in `make_array`**:
   - The `make_array` function uses `left + mid - i - 1` and `left + mid + i` to assign values to the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays. However, the `mid` and `not_mid` calculations might not correctly handle the distribution of elements, especially when `k` is not a divisor of `n`.

3. **Output of `arr` and `cliquess`**:
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are printed after the loop in `func_1`, but they are initialized as `[0] * n` and are not guaranteed to be filled correctly by the `make_array` function. This could lead to incorrect or incomplete output.

4. **Handling of Clique Partition**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the partitioning into the minimum number of cliques. The logic for determining the number of cliques and assigning vertices to these cliques is flawed. For example, the `ceil(n / k)` calculation might not always produce the correct number of cliques for the given problem constraints.

To correct the program, we need to ensure that the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are filled correctly and that the number of cliques is determined accurately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import ceil

def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        start = i * k
        end = min((i + 1) * k, n)
        for j in range(start, end):
            arr[j] = j + 1
            cliquess[j] = i + 1

    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        func_1(n, k)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Clique Calculation**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct for the given problem.

2. **Filling `arr` and `cliquess`**:
   - For each clique, the vertices are assigned values from `1` to `n` in a sequential manner.
   - The `cliquess` array is filled to indicate which clique each vertex belongs to.

3. **Output**:
   - The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are printed correctly after being filled.

This corrected program should work as expected for the given problem description.
