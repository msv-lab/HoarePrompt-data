Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. According to the problem description, for every pair of vertices `(i, j)`, an edge is added if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`. When `k` is large enough (e.g., `k >= n`), every pair of vertices should be connected, forming a single clique. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `make_array` does not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect partition of the graph.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8 16
```
According to the problem description, the output should be a single clique since `k = 16` is much larger than `n = 8`. The expected output should be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
However, the current implementation will produce:
```
2 1 4 3 6 5 8 7
4
1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4
```
This output is incorrect because it suggests that the graph is partitioned into 4 cliques, which is not the minimum possible number of cliques for the given `n` and `k`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
