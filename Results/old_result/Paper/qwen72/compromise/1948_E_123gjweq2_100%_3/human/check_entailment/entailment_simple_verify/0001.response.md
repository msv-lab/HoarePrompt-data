### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - Each vertex should belong to exactly one clique.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` to determine the number of cliques and assign values to the vertices.
   - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The function `make_array` is used to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values and clique assignments.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `cliques` is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable approach to determine the number of cliques.
   - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to arrays of zeros with length `n`.
   - The loop iterates over the range of `cliques`, and for each clique, it calls `make_array` to fill the arrays with values and clique assignments.

4. **Function `make_array`:**
   - `small_element` and `big_element` are calculated to determine the range of values to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - `mid` and `not_mid` are used to split the range of values into two parts.
   - The first part assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` in ascending order to the vertices in the current clique.
   - The second part assigns values from `big_element` to `big_element - not_mid + 1` in descending order to the vertices in the current clique.
   - The clique assignment is done by setting `cliquess[left + i]` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` to the current clique number.

5. **Edge Condition:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is implicitly satisfied by the way the values are assigned. The values are assigned in a way that ensures the difference in indices and values is minimized within each clique.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `arr` which contains the assigned values.
   - It prints the number of cliques.
   - It prints the array `cliquess` which contains the clique assignments.

7. **Validation:**
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the program.
   - The output for each test case matches the expected format and values.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the `make_array` function. The values are assigned in a way that does not ensure the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is always satisfied. Specifically, the values are assigned in ascending order for the first part and descending order for the second part, which can lead to large differences in values for vertices that are close in index, potentially violating the edge condition.

8. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the test case `n = 5, k = 4`:
     - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
     - `arr` and `cliquess` are initialized to `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.
     - First call to `make_array(0, 3, 1)`:
       - `small_element = 1`, `big_element = 4`, `mid = 2`, `not_mid = 2`
       - `arr` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 3, 0]`
       - `cliquess` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 0]`
     - Second call to `make_array(4, 4, 2)`:
       - `small_element = 5`, `big_element = 5`, `mid = 1`, `not_mid = 0`
       - `arr` becomes `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`
       - `cliquess` becomes `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2]`
     - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is not always satisfied. For example, \( |1 - 4| + |1 - 4| = 6 \), which is greater than 4.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly ensure that the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is always satisfied, leading to potential incorrect clique assignments. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
