The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` is less than or equal to `right`, and they represent the bounds of a subarray in an array `arr`. `clique` is a positive integer representing the clique number to be assigned to elements in the subarray.

The function returns an array where each element in the subarray defined by the bounds `left` to `right` (inclusive) is assigned the value `clique`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It returns an array where each element in the subarray from index `left` to index `right` (inclusive) is assigned the value `clique`.**
