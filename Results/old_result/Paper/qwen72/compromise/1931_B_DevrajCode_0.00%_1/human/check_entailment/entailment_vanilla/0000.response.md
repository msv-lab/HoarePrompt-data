### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given `n` containers with initial amounts of water `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - The sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`.
   - We can pour water from any container `i` to any container `j` where `i < j`.
   - We need to determine if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Since the sum of the amounts of water is divisible by `n`, the target amount of water in each container is `total_water // n`.
   - To achieve the target, we need to ensure that we can always pour water from a container with more than the target amount to a container with less than the target amount, while maintaining the condition `i < j`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water for each container.
   - It then iterates through the list of water amounts, maintaining a cumulative difference `container` between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target, and there is no way to pour water from a container with more water to this container without violating the `i < j` condition.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, it means it is possible to achieve the target amount of water in all containers.

4. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is read in one go and split into a list of integers.
   - The first integer `n` is the number of test cases.
   - The subsequent integers are the amounts of water in the containers for the test cases.
   - However, the program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It only processes the first test case and does not loop through the remaining test cases.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly determines if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water for a single test case.
   - However, the program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases. It only processes the first test case and does not loop through the remaining test cases. To fix this, the program should read and process each test case individually.
