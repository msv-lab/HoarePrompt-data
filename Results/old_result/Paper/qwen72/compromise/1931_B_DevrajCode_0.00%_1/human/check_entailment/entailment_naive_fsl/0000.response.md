Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The input format expects multiple test cases, each with its own number of containers and water amounts. However, the program reads all input at once and processes it as a single test case, which is incorrect. Here is a specific example where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
1
43
2
1 3
5
4 5 2 1 3
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
No
```

The program only processes the first test case and does not handle the subsequent test cases correctly.
