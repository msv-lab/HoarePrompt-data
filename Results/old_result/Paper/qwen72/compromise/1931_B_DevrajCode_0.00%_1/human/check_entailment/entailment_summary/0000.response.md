Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly handle the input format as specified in the problem description. The problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the program only processes one test case. The input is read all at once and split into a list, which is then directly passed to `func_1` without considering the structure of multiple test cases. Each test case should be processed independently, and the program should output the result for each test case.

Additionally, the program's logic for determining if the water can be evenly distributed is flawed. The function `func_1` calculates the target amount of water each container should have and then iterates through the list of water amounts, accumulating the difference between the current amount and the target. If at any point this accumulated difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. However, this logic does not correctly account for the possibility of pouring water from a container with more water to a container with less water, as long as the total water can be evenly distributed.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read and process each test case independently.
2. For each test case, calculate the target amount of water.
3. Check if it is possible to redistribute the water such that all containers have the target amount. This can be done by ensuring that the sum of the differences between the current amounts and the target is zero, and that no container has less water than the target before all redistributions are complete.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
