### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Check**:
   - The program reads the entire input at once and splits it into a list of strings. The first integer `n` is taken as the number of test cases, and the rest of the list `a` is taken as the concatenated list of all water amounts for all test cases.
   - This approach is incorrect because it assumes that the input is a single line of integers, which is not the case according to the problem description. The input should be read line by line to handle multiple test cases correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
   - The function calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. Since the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, this check is redundant and will always pass.
   - The function then calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is `total_water // n`.
   - It initializes a variable `container` to 0, which is used to keep track of the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
   - The function iterates over the list `a` and updates `container` by adding the difference between the current water amount and the target amount.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, the function returns 'No', indicating that it is not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - If the loop completes without `container` becoming negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

3. **Logic of the Function**:
   - The logic of the function is based on the idea that if the cumulative difference between the current water amount and the target amount ever becomes negative, it means that at some point, a container has less water than required to reach the target, and there is no way to pour water into it from a container with a higher index (since `i < j`).
   - This logic is correct for the problem's constraints and requirements.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The program does not handle multiple test cases correctly. It should read the input line by line and process each test case separately.
   - The current implementation processes all test cases as if they were a single test case, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` itself is logically correct for a single test case. However, the program as a whole is incorrect because it does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description. The input parsing and the way the function is called need to be fixed to correctly process each test case independently.

**Correctness: **False****

To fix the program, you would need to read the input line by line and process each test case separately. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    results.append(func_1(n, a))

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected version reads the input line by line, processes each test case independently, and collects the results to print them at the end.
