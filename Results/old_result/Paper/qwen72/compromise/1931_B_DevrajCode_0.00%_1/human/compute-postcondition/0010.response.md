Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It checks if the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n` and if it is possible to redistribute the integers in `a` such that each element equals the average of the sum. If the sum of `a` is not divisible by `n` or if redistribution is not possible, the function returns 'No'. If the redistribution is possible, the function returns 'Yes'. **
