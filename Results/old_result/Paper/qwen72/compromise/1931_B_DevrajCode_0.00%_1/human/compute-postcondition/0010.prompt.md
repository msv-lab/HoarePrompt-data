You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if (total_water % n != 0) :
        return 'No'
        #The program returns 'No'
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. `total_water` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, and `total_water % n` is equal to 0.
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
        
    #State: `container` is 0.
    return 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. If the sum of the integers in `a` is divisible by `n`, the function returns 'Yes'. If the sum of the integers in `a` is not divisible by `n`, the function returns 'No'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'No'

Case_2: The program returns 'Yes'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
