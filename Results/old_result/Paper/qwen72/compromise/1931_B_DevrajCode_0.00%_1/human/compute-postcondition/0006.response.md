The only objects in the loop head are the variable `water` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, and `total_water` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a`. `total_water % n` is equal to 0, and `target` is equal to `total_water // n`. `container` is 0. 

For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least one element, and `water` should be the first element of `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 10^9, `total_water` is equal to the sum of all elements in `a`, `total_water % n` is equal to 0, `target` is equal to `total_water // n`, `container` is 0, `a` must have at least one element, `water` is the first element of `a`**
