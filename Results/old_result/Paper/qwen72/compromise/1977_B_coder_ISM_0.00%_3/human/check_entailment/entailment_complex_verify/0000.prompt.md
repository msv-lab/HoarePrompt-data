You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24
    
    15

Output

    1

    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: After the loop has executed all iterations, `nalla` will be `t - 1`, `t` will remain the same as the input integer, `i` will be 29, `length` will be either 30 or 31, and `s` will be a list of 30 or 31 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1'. If `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` will be 31, `s[30]` will be '1', and `s[29]` will be '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `length` will remain 30, `s` will remain a list of 30 elements, and `s[29]` will not be '0'. Additionally, any occurrences of the pattern '1' followed by '-1' in the list `s` will be replaced by '-1' followed by '0', starting from the beginning of the list and moving towards the end.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30) and converts it into a binary string representation of length 30, stored in a list `s`. It then modifies the list `s` according to specific rules: if two consecutive '1's are found, the first '1' is replaced with '-1', and a flag is set. If the flag is set and the last element of `s` is '0', it is changed to '1'. If the flag is set and the last element is not '0', the last element is changed to '0', and an additional '1' is appended to `s`, increasing its length to 31. Finally, it prints the modified list `s`, the length of `s`, and the list `s` again. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that there should not exist an index \(0 \le i \le n - 2\) such that both \(a_i \neq 0\) and \(a_{i + 1} \neq 0\). 

For example, consider the input \(x = 14\). The expected output should be an array like `[0, -1, 0, 0, 1]` (since \(0 \cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + 0 \cdot 2^2 + 0 \cdot 2^3 + 1 \cdot 2^4 = -2 + 16 = 14\)). However, the program outputs an array that does not meet this requirement. 

Let's break down the program's output for \(x = 14\):

1. The initial binary representation of 14 is `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, ...]` (30 elements long).
2. The program then tries to adjust the array to meet the requirement, but it does not do so correctly.

The program's output for \(x = 14\) is:
```
30
0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

This output is clearly incorrect because it does not meet the requirement that no two consecutive elements should be non-zero. The correct output should be something like:
```
5
0 -1 0 0 1
```

Thus, the program is incorrect.
