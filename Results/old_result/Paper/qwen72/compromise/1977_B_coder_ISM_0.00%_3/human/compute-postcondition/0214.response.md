Postcondition: ***`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29). If `flag` is 1 and `s[2]` is '0', then `s[2]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.***
