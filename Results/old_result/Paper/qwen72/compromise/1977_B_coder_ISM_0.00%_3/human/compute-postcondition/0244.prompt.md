Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, and `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29). The loop has processed each element from index 0 to 28. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` was 0 and `s[29]` was '1' and `s[30]` was also '1', then `s[29]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` was 0 and `s[29]` was '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. If none of these conditions were met, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29). The loop has processed each element from index 0 to 28. If `flag` was 1 and `s[29]` was '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1' and `flag` is set to 0. If `flag` was 0 and `s[29]` was '1' and `s[30]` was also '1', then `s[29]` is set to '-1' and `flag` is set to 1. If `flag` was 0 and `s[29]` was '0', then `s[29]` is set to '1'. If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'. If none of these conditions were met, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. If `s[i]` was '-1' and `s[i - 1]` was '1', then `s[i]` is now '0' and `s[i - 1]` is now '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29). If `s[2]` was '-1' and `s[1]` was '1', then `s[2]` is now '0' and `s[1]` is now '-1'. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged. Additionally, `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nalla` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list with 30 elements where each element represents the bit at the corresponding position in `x` (from 0 to 29). If `s[2]` was '-1' and `s[1]` was '1', then `s[2]` is now '0' and `s[1]` is now '-1'. Additionally, `s[3]` is now '0', and `flag` is either 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `flag` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
