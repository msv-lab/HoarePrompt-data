Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 29, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings. If `flag` was 1 at the start and `s[29]` is '0', then `s[29]` is converted to '1' and the final value of `flag` is 1. If `flag` was 1 at the start and `s[29]` is not '0', then `length` is increased to 31, `s[30]` is '1', `s[29]` remains '0', and the final value of `flag` is 1. If `flag` was 0 at the start, the list `s` remains unchanged with 30 strings, and the final value of `flag` will depend on the last bit processed, ensuring that either `flag` is 0 or `s[29]` is not '0'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, length):
    if (s[i] == '-1') & (s[i - 1] == '1'):
        s[i] = '0'
        s[i - 1] = '-1'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings. If the second element of `s` is '-1' and the first element is '1', the first element is set to '-1', the second element is set to '0', and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. `flag` will be determined as described. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged and `flag` will be determined as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings. If the second element of `s` is '-1' and the first element is '1', the first element of `s` is set to '-1', the second element is set to '0', and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. `flag` will be determined as described. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged and `flag` will be determined as described.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `length` is 30, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings. If the third element of `s` is '-1' and the second element is '1', the second element of `s` is set to '-1', the third element is set to '0', and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. `flag` is determined as described. Otherwise, the elements of `s` remain unchanged and `flag` is determined as described.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
