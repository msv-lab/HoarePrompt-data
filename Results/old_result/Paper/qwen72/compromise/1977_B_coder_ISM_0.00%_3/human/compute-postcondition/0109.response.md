Postcondition: **`nalla` is 0, `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `length` is 30, `flag` is 0, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a list of 30 strings, each representing a bit of `x` from the least significant bit (bit at position 0) to the most significant bit (bit at position 29). The first element of `s` is not '0' or `flag` is 0. The current value of `s[i]` is '1', and `s[i + 1]` is also '1'.**
