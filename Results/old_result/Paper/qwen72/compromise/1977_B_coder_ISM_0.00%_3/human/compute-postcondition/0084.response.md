Output State: **`nalla` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is `length - 1`, `length` will remain either 30 or 31, `s` will be a list of 30 or 31 elements, each either '1', '0', or '-1', `flag` is either 0 or 1, and if `flag` is 1 and `s[29]` is '0', then `length` will be 31, `s[30]` will be '1', and `s[29]` will be '0'. If `flag` is 0, then `length` will remain 30, `s` will remain a list of 30 elements, and `s[29]` will not be '0'. Any occurrences of the pattern '1' followed by '-1' in the list `s` will be replaced by '-1' followed by '0', starting from the beginning of the list and moving towards the end. `x` is an input integer.**
