Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `nalla` is 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 29.
   - `length` is 30.
   - `x` is an input integer.
   - `s` is a list of 30 strings.
   - The loop has processed all elements from index 1 to 29.
   - If any element in `s` from index 1 to 29 was '-1' and the element immediately before it was '1', the '1' has been changed to '-1', and the '-1' has been changed to '0'.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(length)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `length` is explicitly given as 30 in the initial state.
   - The loop and the conditions described in the initial state do not affect the value of `length`.
   - Therefore, the value of `length` remains 30.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(length)` statement will print the value of `length`.

Output: **30**
