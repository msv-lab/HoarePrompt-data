You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

Input

    3
    
    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then increments each element of `a` by its index plus one. After processing, it generates a new list `ans` that contains unique, sorted (in descending order) elements from the updated `a`, along with additional elements to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`. The function prints the elements of `ans` in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the insertion and deletion operations as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires that for each operation, an element `a[i] + i` is inserted into the set `S`, and then `a[i]` is deleted from the array `a`. However, the provided program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element before sorting and constructing the final array `b`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2
2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3 2
```

The program seems to produce the correct output for this case, but let's consider a more complex case:

**Input:**
```
1
3
6 4 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
11 7 6
```

**Actual Output:**
```
11 7 6
```

The program also seems to produce the correct output for this case. However, the issue lies in the logic of the program, which does not follow the exact steps described in the problem statement. The problem requires that the elements are inserted into the set `S` and then the array `a` is modified by removing the selected element. The provided program modifies the array `a` directly and then uses a counter to handle duplicates, which is not the same as the described operations.

To illustrate the issue more clearly, consider the following case:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
5 4 3 2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
5 4 3 2
```

The program still seems to produce the correct output, but the logic is flawed. The correct approach should involve:

1. Selecting an index `i` and inserting `a[i] + i` into the set `S`.
2. Removing `a[i]` from the array `a`.
3. Repeating the above steps `n` times.

The provided program does not follow this exact sequence of operations, and it relies on a different approach that may not work for all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
