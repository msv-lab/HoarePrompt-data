Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element. Each integer in `a` was originally in the range \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and has been incremented by \(i + 1\) for all \(0 \leq i < n\).
   - `i` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, and all values in `counter` are 0.
   - `cur` is 0.
   - `cnt` is 0.
   - `ans` is a list containing all the elements of `a` and `cnt` additional elements, each of which is one less than the previous element, such that the total length of `ans` is `n + cnt`.

2. **Understanding the Variables:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order.
   - Each element in `a` has been incremented by its index plus one.
   - `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in `a`, but all values are 0, indicating that no elements in `a` have been counted.
   - `cur` and `cnt` are both 0.
   - `ans` is a list that initially contains all elements of `a` and then `cnt` additional elements, each one less than the previous element. Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will only contain the elements of `a`.

3. **Final State:**
   - The loop has finished executing all iterations, so the list `a` and the list `ans` are fully defined.
   - Since `cnt` is 0, `ans` will be exactly the same as `a`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print all elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given that `ans` is the same as `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, the output will be the elements of `a` printed in descending order.

Output: **a_0 a_1 a_2 ... a_(n-1) (where a_0, a_1, ..., a_(n-1) are the elements of the list `a` in descending order)**
