Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a list of unique integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is n-1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(set(a))` converts the list `a` into a set to remove any duplicate values and then converts it back into a list. This means that `a` now contains only unique integers. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `i`, `counter`, and `cur`) remain unchanged. The specific values of `a` are still within the given range, and the `counter` object will now reflect the counts of these unique integers.
