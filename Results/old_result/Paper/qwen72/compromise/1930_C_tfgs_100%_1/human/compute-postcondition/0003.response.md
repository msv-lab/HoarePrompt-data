The value of `a[i]` is incremented by `i + 1`. Since `i` is 0, `a[0]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `a[0]` is now `a[0] + 1`, `i` is 0.**
