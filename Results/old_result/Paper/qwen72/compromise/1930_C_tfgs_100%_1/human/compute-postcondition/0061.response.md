Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, all values in `counter` are 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all the elements of `a` and additional elements that were appended during the loop execution, such that the total length of `ans` is `n`.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4.
- **`n`**: Remains the same input integer within the range 1 to 3 · 10^5.
- **`a`**: The list `a` remains unchanged in terms of its elements and length. It is still a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, with each integer incremented by (i + 1).
- **`i`**: After the loop finishes, `i` is equal to `len(a) - 1`, meaning the loop has iterated over all elements in `a`.
- **`counter`**: The `counter` object, which initially counted the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, now has all values set to 0 because each integer in `a` has been processed and its count decremented.
- **`cur`**: The variable `cur` is 0 because it is adjusted based on the counts in `counter`, and all counts in `counter` are 0 by the end of the loop.
- **`cnt`**: The variable `cnt` is 0 because it is initially the difference between `n` and the length of `a`, and this difference is reduced by the number of elements appended to `ans` during the loop execution.
- **`ans`**: The list `ans` contains all the elements of `a` and additional elements that were appended during the loop execution. The total length of `ans` is `n`, meaning that the loop has successfully filled `ans` with `n` elements, which is the desired outcome.
