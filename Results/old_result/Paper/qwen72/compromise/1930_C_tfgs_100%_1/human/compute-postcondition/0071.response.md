Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then increments each element of `a` by its index plus one. After processing, it generates a new list `ans` that contains unique, sorted (in descending order) elements from the updated `a`, along with additional elements to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`. The function prints the elements of `ans` in descending order. **
