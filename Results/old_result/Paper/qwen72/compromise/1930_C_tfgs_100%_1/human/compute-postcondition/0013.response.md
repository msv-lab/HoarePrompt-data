Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is n-1, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`.**

Explanation:
- The code `cnt = n - len(a)` calculates the difference between `n` and the length of the list `a`.
- `cnt` is assigned this difference.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `counter`, `cur`) remain unchanged.
- The length of `a` is less than or equal to `n` because `a` is a list derived from `n` elements, possibly with some elements removed.
- Therefore, `cnt` is a non-negative integer representing the number of elements that were not included in the list `a`.
