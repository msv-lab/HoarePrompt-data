The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `a`. If `a` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is set to `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `a`. However, for the loop to execute, `i` should start from 0, and `a` must have at least one element.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `a` must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is the difference between `n` and the length of `a`, `ans` is an empty list.**
