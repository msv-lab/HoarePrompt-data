Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is a Counter object that counts the occurrences of each integer in the updated list `a`, all values in `counter` are 0, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all the elements of `a` and `cnt` additional elements, each of which is one less than the previous element, such that the total length of `ans` is `n + cnt`.**

Natural Language Explanation:
- The loop has completed all its iterations.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `i`, `counter`, and `cur` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The variable `cnt` is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
- The list `ans` now contains all the elements from the original list `a`, plus `cnt` additional elements. Each of these additional elements is one less than the previous element in the list, starting from the last element of `a`.
- The total length of `ans` is `n + cnt`, which is the original length of `a` plus the number of elements appended during the loop execution.
