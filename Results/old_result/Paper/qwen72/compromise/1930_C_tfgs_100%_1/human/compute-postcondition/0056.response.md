The value of `cur` is decremented by `adv`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order with at least 1 element, each integer was originally in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and has been incremented by (i + 1) for all 0 ≤ i < n, `i` is `i + 1`, `len(a)` remains the same, `adv` is greater than or equal to 0, `ans` now includes the values `a[i - 1] - j - 1` for all 0 ≤ j < `adv` at the end of the list, `cnt` is `cnt - adv`, `cur` is `cur - adv`.**
