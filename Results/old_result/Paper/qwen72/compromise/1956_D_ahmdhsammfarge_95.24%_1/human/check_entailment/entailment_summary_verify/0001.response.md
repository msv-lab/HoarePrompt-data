### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing the MEX operation on subarrays.
   - The MEX operation sets all elements in the subarray `a[l:r]` to the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum sum using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` to maximize the sum of the array after applying the MEX operation.
   - The function iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the MEX operation is applied to each subarray.
   - However, the MEX of a subarray is approximated by `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is incorrect. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - This approximation leads to incorrect results and does not reflect the true MEX value.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to generate a sequence of operations to set the subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX value.
   - The function recursively appends the same subarray indices multiple times, which is not the correct way to achieve the MEX transformation.
   - It does not compute the MEX value or update the array accordingly.
   - The recursive calls are redundant and do not contribute to the correct solution.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function is supposed to apply the MEX operation to the subarray `a[l:r]` and update the array and operations list.
   - The function appends the operation to the `ops` list but does not correctly compute the MEX value.
   - The function sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX value.
   - The function also appends redundant operations, which is not necessary.
   - The function summary correctly describes the behavior of the function, but the behavior itself is flawed as it does not compute the MEX value and updates the array incorrectly.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray.
- The operations generated by the functions are not valid for achieving the maximum sum.
- The logic for updating the array and generating operations is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to compute the MEX value and generates incorrect operations.

Final: **False**
