### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation that sets a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(lst)`**
   - This function aims to find the optimal subarray `[l, r]` to maximize the sum of the array after applying the MEX operation.
   - It iterates over all possible subarrays and calculates the potential new sum if the MEX operation is applied to each subarray.
   - The MEX of a subarray is approximated by `(j - i + 1) ** 2`, which is not correct. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the subarray, not the square of the subarray length.
   - The function returns the indices of the subarray that would maximize the sum.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(r, l, ops: list)`**
   - This function is intended to generate a sequence of operations to set the subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX value.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the MEX operation. It recursively appends the same subarray indices multiple times, which is not the correct way to achieve the MEX transformation.
   - The function does not compute the MEX value or update the array accordingly.

4. **Function 3: `func_3(r, l, lst: list, ops: list)`**
   - This function is supposed to apply the MEX operation to the subarray `a[l:r]` and update the array and operations list.
   - It appends the operation to the `ops` list but does not correctly compute the MEX value.
   - The function sets the subarray to the length of the subarray, which is not the MEX value.
   - The function also appends redundant operations, which is not necessary.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly compute the MEX value for the subarray.
- The operations generated by the functions are not valid for achieving the maximum sum.
- The logic for updating the array and generating operations is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to compute the MEX value and generates incorrect operations.
