Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the operation parameters, and `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, r + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the function operates accordingly. Otherwise, the function does not perform any additional operations.**
