Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (4 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the fifth element to the end of `lst` plus 16, `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is [1, 3], and `l` is [1, 3] if `sm` > `over_sum`; otherwise, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.**

Explanation:
- The value of `sm` is updated to the sum of the first element of `lst` (since `i` is 1, `lst[:i]` is `lst[:1]` which is just the first element), plus the sum of elements from the fifth element to the end of `lst` (since `j` is 4, `lst[j + 1:]` is `lst[5:]`), plus 16 (since `(j - i + 1) ** 2` is `(4 - 1 + 1) ** 2` which is `4 ** 2` and equals 16).
- The values of `lst`, `i`, `j`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
- `over_sum` is updated to `sm` if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`, and `r` and `l` are updated to [1, 3] if `sm` is greater than `over_sum`. If `sm` is not greater than `over_sum`, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.
