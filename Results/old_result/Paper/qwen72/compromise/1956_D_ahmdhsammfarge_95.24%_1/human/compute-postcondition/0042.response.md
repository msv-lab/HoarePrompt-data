Output State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n - 1`, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n - 1`, and the current value of `sm` is greater than `over_sum`.**

The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l`, respectively. Since `i` is `n - 2` and `j` is `n - 1`, `r` is now `n - 2` and `l` is now `n - 1`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
