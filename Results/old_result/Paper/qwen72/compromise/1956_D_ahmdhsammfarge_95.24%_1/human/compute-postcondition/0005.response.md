Initial State: `lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` is a list of lists where each inner list contains two integers representing the operation parameters, and `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, r + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the function operates accordingly. Otherwise, the function does not perform any additional operations.

```
func_2(r, l, ops)
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

1. The function `func_2` is called with parameters `r`, `l`, and `ops`.
2. The function checks the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]`.
3. If the minimum value is 0, the function performs some operation. The exact operation is not specified, but it is implied that `ops` is modified or used in some way.
4. If the minimum value is not 0, the function does not perform any additional operations.

Since the exact operation is not specified, we can only infer that if the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the function might modify `ops` or some other variables. However, without the function's implementation, we cannot determine the exact changes.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `r` and `l` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= r <= l < len(lst), `ops` now includes an additional list `[r + 1, r + 1]`. If the minimum value in the sublist `lst[r:l + 1]` is 0, the function may have performed some operation, but the exact changes are unknown. If the minimum value is not 0, no additional operations were performed.**
