The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers with a length `n` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 18`. The function returns two indices, `r` and `l`, where `r` is `n - 1` and `l` is `len(lst) - 1`. These indices correspond to the positions in the list `lst` where the maximum value of `sm` was found during the loop iterations.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` with length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18) and returns two indices, `r` and `l`, where `r` is `n - 1` and `l` is `len(lst) - 1`. These indices indicate the positions in `lst` where the maximum value of `sm` was found during the loop iterations.**
