Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18). `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `lst` (i.e., `n-1`), `sm` is the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n-1)^2`. If `sm` > `over_sum` at any iteration, `over_sum` is updated to the maximum value of `sm` found, and `r` and `l` are set to the corresponding indices `[i, j]` where this maximum `sm` was found. Otherwise, `over_sum`, `r`, and `l` remain unchanged.**

In natural language, this means:
- The list `lst` remains unchanged with its original length `n`.
- The variable `i` is still 1.
- The variable `j` will be the last index of the list, which is `n-1`.
- The variable `sm` will be the sum of the first element of `lst` plus the sum of elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n-1)^2`.
- The variable `over_sum` will hold the maximum value of `sm` that was found during all iterations of the loop.
- The variables `r` and `l` will hold the indices `[i, j]` where this maximum `sm` was found. If no `sm` value was greater than the initial `over_sum`, then `r` and `l` will remain unchanged from their initial values.
