Output State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n`, `sm` is the sum of the first `n - 2` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(n - (n - 2) + 1)`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the values of `i` and `j` to the variables `r` and `l` respectively. Since `i` is `n - 2` and `j` is `n`, `r` becomes `n - 2` and `l` becomes `n`. The other variables (`lst`, `i`, `j`, and `sm`) remain unchanged.
