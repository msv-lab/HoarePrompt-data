The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `lst`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18).
- `i` is `n - 2`.
- `j` is `n - 1`.
- `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`.
- If `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n - 1`, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `j` must still be less than `len(lst)`. However, since `j` is already `n - 1`, the next value of `j` would be `n`, which is equal to `len(lst)`. Therefore, the loop will not execute again.

State: **`lst` remains a list of integers with length `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is `n - 2`, `j` is `n`, `sm` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `lst` plus the sum of the elements from the second-to-last element to the end of `lst` plus `(j - i + 1)`. If `sm` > `over_sum`, `r` is `n - 2`, `l` is `n - 1`, and `over_sum` is equal to `sm`.**
