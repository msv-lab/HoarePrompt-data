The objects in the loop head are `j` and `lst`. The loop will execute if the range from `i + 1` to `len(lst)` is not empty. Given that `i` is 1, the loop will execute if `len(lst)` is greater than `i + 1`, which means `len(lst)` must be greater than 2.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `j` must start at `i + 1`, which is 2.
- `lst` must have a length greater than 2.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with length `n` (3 ≤ `n` ≤ 18), `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
