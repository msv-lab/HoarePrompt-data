The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j`. `a` and `b` are binary strings, and `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the lengths of `a` and `b` respectively, with the constraints 1 <= i, j <= 2 * 10^5.

Case_1: If the character at position `i` in the string `a` is found in the substring `b[j:]`, the function returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in `b[j:]`.

Case_2: If the character at position `i` in the string `a` is not found in the substring `b[j:]`, the function returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It returns the sum of `j` and the position of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` if `a[i]` is found in `b[j:]`. If `a[i]` is not found in `b[j:]`, it returns -1.**
