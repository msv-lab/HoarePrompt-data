### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths of the binary strings `a` and `b` (denoted as `n` and `m`), and then the strings themselves.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `i`, `j`, and `c` are initialized to 0. 
     - `i` is the index for string `a`.
     - `j` is the index for string `b`.
     - `c` is the count of the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

3. **Loop:**
   - The program uses a `while` loop to iterate through the strings `a` and `b` as long as `i` is less than `n` and `j` is less than `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calls `func_1(a, b, i, j)` to find the index in `b` starting from `j` where the character `a[i]` is found.
   - If `func_1` returns a valid index (not -1), it updates `j` to `new_j + 1` (the next position in `b` after the found character), increments `i` (to move to the next character in `a`), and increments `c` (to count the matched character).
   - If `func_1` returns -1, it means the character `a[i]` is not found in the remaining part of `b`, and the loop breaks.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b, i, j)` searches for the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`.
   - If the character is found, it returns the index of the character in the substring `b[j:]`, which is `j + index`.
   - If the character is not found, it returns -1.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the value of `c`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.
- The `while` loop ensures that the program iterates through the strings `a` and `b` until it either finds a match for all characters in `a` or exhausts the search in `b`.
- The function `func_1` is used to find the next occurrence of the character `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`. This is a valid approach to determine if a prefix of `a` is a subsequence of `b`.
- The program correctly increments the indices and the count `c` when a match is found.
- The program correctly breaks the loop and prints the result when a match is not found.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
