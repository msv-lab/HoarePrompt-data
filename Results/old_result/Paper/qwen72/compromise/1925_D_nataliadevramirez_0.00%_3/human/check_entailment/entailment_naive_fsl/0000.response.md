Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the calculation of the result in `func_1`. The current implementation assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion, which is incorrect. The expected value should take into account the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
Here, there are 3 children, 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1, and 2 excursions. The possible pairs for excursions are (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). The probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) in each excursion is \(\frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, the expected increase in the friendship value of (1, 2) over 2 excursions is:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{3} \times 1\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} \times 2\right) = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = 1
\]
The initial friendship value is 1, so the expected total sum of friendship values is:
\[
1 + 1 = 2
\]
However, the program will output:
\[
1 \times \left(\frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2}\right) = 1 \times 3 = 3
\]
which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve calculating the expected value for each pair and summing these expected values. The expected value for a pair (a, b) with initial friendship value \(f\) over \(k\) excursions is:
\[
f \times \left(1 + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)
\]
where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the number of possible pairs of children. This value should then be summed over all pairs and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
