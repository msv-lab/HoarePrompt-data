### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the calculation of the result in `func_1`.

#### Analysis of the Problem:
1. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should consider the probability of each pair being chosen.
   - For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is the number of possible pairs of children.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen in an excursion, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - Therefore, the expected increase in the friendship value of a pair (a, b) with initial friendship value \(f\) over \(k\) excursions is:
     \[
     f \times \left(1 + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)
     \]
   - This value should be summed over all pairs of friends and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Analysis of the Program:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The current implementation assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion, which is incorrect.
  - The line `result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` calculates the sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value \(f\), which is not the correct expected value.
  - This calculation is equivalent to assuming that the pair is chosen \(k\) times, which is not the case.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function reads the input correctly and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
  - However, the result from `func_1` is incorrect due to the flawed calculation in `func_1`.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach should involve:
  - Calculating the number of possible pairs of children: \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
  - For each pair of friends, calculating the expected increase in their friendship value over \(k\) excursions: \(f \times \left(1 + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)\).
  - Summing these expected values for all pairs of friends and taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The current implementation assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion, which is incorrect.

**Final: False**
