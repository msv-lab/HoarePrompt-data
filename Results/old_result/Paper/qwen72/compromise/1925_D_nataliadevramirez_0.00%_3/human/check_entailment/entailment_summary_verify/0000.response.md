### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if the pair is chosen.
   - The probability of choosing any specific pair of friends in each excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the number of possible pairs of children.

2. **Current Implementation Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the result as:
     \[
     \text{result} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \times \left(\frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2}\right) \mod \text{MOD}
     \]
   - This formula assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion, which is incorrect. The correct approach should consider the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

3. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of a pair (a, b) with initial friendship value \( f \) over \( k \) excursions is:
     \[
     f \times \left(1 + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)
     \]
   - The number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - Therefore, the expected value for each pair (a, b) is:
     \[
     f \times \left(1 + \frac{k}{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}\right) = f \times \left(1 + \frac{2k}{n(n-1)}\right)
     \]
   - Summing this over all pairs and taking modulo \(10^9 + 7\) gives the correct expected value.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     3 1 2
     1 2 1
     ```
   - Here, \( n = 3 \), \( m = 1 \), \( k = 2 \), and the only pair of friends is (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1.
   - The number of possible pairs is \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of (1, 2) over 2 excursions is:
     \[
     1 \times \left(1 + \frac{2 \times 2}{3 \times 2}\right) = 1 \times \left(1 + \frac{4}{6}\right) = 1 \times \left(1 + \frac{2}{3}\right) = 1 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{5}{3}
     \]
   - Since we need the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\), we need to convert \(\frac{5}{3}\) to an integer using modular arithmetic. The modular inverse of 3 modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 333333336 (since \(3 \times 333333336 \equiv 1 \mod (10^9 + 7)\)).
   - Therefore, the expected value is:
     \[
     5 \times 333333336 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 1666666680 \mod (10^9 + 7) = 2
     \]
   - The program, however, calculates:
     \[
     1 \times \left(\frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2}\right) = 1 \times 3 = 3
     \]
   - This is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all \( k \) pairs chosen for the excursions. The current implementation assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion, which is not the case. The correct approach should involve calculating the expected value for each pair and summing these expected values.

Final: **False**
