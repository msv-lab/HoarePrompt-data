No variables are passed to the function func_2, but it reads inputs from the standard input. The first input is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function reads three integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively. It then reads m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value.
