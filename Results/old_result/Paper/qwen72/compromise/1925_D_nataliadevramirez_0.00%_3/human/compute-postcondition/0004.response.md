Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. It then reads `m` lines, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The function processes these inputs by calling another function `func_1` and prints the result for each test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected. **
