The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads inputs from the standard input. The inputs are structured as follows:

- The first input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the function reads three integers:
  - `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the number of children.
  - `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)) representing the number of pairs of friends.
  - `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of excursions.
- Following these, the function reads `m` lines, each containing three integers:
  - `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) and `b_i` (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) representing the indices of a pair of children who are friends.
  - `f_i` (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial friendship value between these two children.

The function processes these inputs and returns the results for each test case. The exact nature of the results is not specified, but it is implied that the function will compute some output based on the provided inputs.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. It then reads `m` lines, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The function processes these inputs and returns the results for each test case.**
