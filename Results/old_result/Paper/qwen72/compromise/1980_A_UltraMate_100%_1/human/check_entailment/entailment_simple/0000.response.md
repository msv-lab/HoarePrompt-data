### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Counter Usage**:
   - The program uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`. This is a correct and efficient way to count the frequencies of each character.

3. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum number of problems needed to be created.
   - It iterates over the string `p` which contains the characters 'A' to 'G'. For each character `i` in `p`, if `i` is not in the counter `hmp`, it adds `m` to `ans`. This is correct because if there are no problems of a certain difficulty level, Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty level for each round.

4. **Additional Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates over the keys in the counter `hmp`. For each key `i`, if the count `hmp[i]` is less than `m`, it adds the difference `m - hmp[i]` to `ans`. This is correct because if there are fewer problems of a certain difficulty level than required, Vlad needs to create the additional problems to meet the requirement for `m` rounds.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which is the minimum number of problems needed to be created.

6. **State After Execution**:
   - The program correctly resets the variables `n`, `m`, `s`, and `ans` for each test case, ensuring that the calculations for each test case are independent.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of problems needed to be created to hold `m` rounds. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and performs the necessary calculations accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
