The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. It calculates the number of additional characters needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `s`, and prints this number for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the input integer `t` remains unchanged.
