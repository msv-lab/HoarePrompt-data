### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation.
   - The operation involves selecting an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - **Correctness:** This function is correct and correctly checks if all elements are zero.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \) (i.e., the middle elements).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i \) is greater than 1 and both \( a_{i-1} \) and \( a_{i+1} \) are greater than 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it applies the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - **Incorrect Operation Application:**
     - The current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect. It uses `list[i - 1]` as a multiplier, which is not the correct way to apply the operation.
     - The correct operation should be:
       ```python
       list[i - 1] -= 1
       list[i] -= 2
       list[i + 1] -= 1
       ```
   - **Early Termination:**
     - The function prints "no" and returns if \( a_{i-1} \) becomes zero during the operation, which is not the correct approach. It should continue to check the entire list.
   - **Final Check:**
     - The final check using `func_1` is correct, but the function should return the result rather than printing it directly.

4. **Corrected Function 2:**
   - The corrected function should apply the operation correctly and check the entire list after all operations are applied.
   - It should return "YES" or "NO" based on the final state of the list.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment correctly identified the issues in the `func_2` function, specifically the incorrect operation application and the early termination. The provided corrected version of the program addresses these issues and is the correct approach to solving the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
