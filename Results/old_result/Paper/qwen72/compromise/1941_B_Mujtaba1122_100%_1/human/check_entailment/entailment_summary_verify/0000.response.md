### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**:
   - The problem specifies that the operation should subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`. However, the `func_2` function incorrectly uses `list[i - 1]` as the multiplier for the subtraction. This means that the operation is not applied as described in the problem, leading to incorrect results.
   - For example, if `list[i - 1]` is 2, the function will subtract 2 from `list[i + 1]`, 4 from `list[i]`, and 2 from `list[i - 1]`, which is not the intended operation.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program does not handle cases where the array elements are not sufficient to perform the operation. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 1]`, it should be impossible to make all elements zero, but the program does not correctly handle this case.
   - The function `func_2` only checks if `list[i - 1]` becomes zero during the operation, but it does not check if the operation can be applied at all. This means that the program might incorrectly print 'no' even when the operation cannot be applied.

3. **Final Check**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to check if all elements are zero, but it is called after the operations are applied. If the operations are applied incorrectly, `func_1` will not return the correct result.
   - The function `func_2` should ensure that the operations are applied correctly and that the final state of the array is checked properly.

4. **Print Statements**:
   - The program uses `print('no')` and `print('YES')` or `print('NO')` directly, which does not match the required output format of the problem description. The output should be "YES" or "NO" without any additional text.
   - The use of `print('no')` is particularly problematic because it prints an additional message that is not part of the expected output.

### Specific Case Analysis:
- **Input**: `3\n3\n1 1 1`
- **Expected Output**: `NO`
- **Actual Output**: `no` (which is incorrect because it should be `NO` without the additional `no`).

### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program. The program does not apply the operation as specified, does not handle edge cases properly, and does not follow the required output format.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
