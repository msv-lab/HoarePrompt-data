Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Transitions**:
   - The program attempts to assign 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters based on the number of scenarios that already have 'F' or 'S' transitions. However, this approach does not ensure that no permutation of scenarios will have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

2. **Logical Errors in Assignment**:
   - The program uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine the number of scenarios to assign 'F' or 'S' to. This is incorrect because it does not account for the ceiling function \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\). The correct threshold should be \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\).

3. **Symmetry Violation**:
   - The program does not ensure that the matrix remains symmetric after assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters. The problem requires that the transition matrix be symmetric, meaning that if the transition from scenario \(i\) to scenario \(j\) is 'F', then the transition from scenario \(j\) to scenario \(i\) must also be 'F'.

4. **Permutation Check**:
   - The program does not check if the resulting transition matrix satisfies the condition for all permutations of the scenarios. This is a crucial part of the problem, and the program should include a mechanism to verify this condition.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. Ensure the matrix remains symmetric after assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters.
2. Use a more sophisticated algorithm to assign the transitions, ensuring that no permutation of scenarios will have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
3. Verify the condition for all permutations of the scenarios.

Given the complexity of the problem, a more detailed and robust algorithm would be required to ensure correctness. The provided program does not meet these requirements and is therefore incorrect.
