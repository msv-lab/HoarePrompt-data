### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and initializes arrays `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row in the transition matrix.
   - For each character in the input string, it updates the counts in `a` and `b` if the character is 'F' or 'S', respectively.
   - The input string is stored in `xx` for later use.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - This step is correct and helps in identifying scenarios that are already biased towards one type of transition.

4. **Deciding Transitions for Undecided Pairs:**
   - The program decides the transitions for the undecided pairs ('?') based on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`.
   - If `sa` is longer or equal to `sb`, it tries to balance the number of funny and scary transitions by assigning 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - If `sb` is longer, it does the opposite, assigning 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sb` and 'F' to the rest.
   - This logic is intended to ensure that the number of consecutive transitions of the same type does not exceed `3n/4`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program constructs the output strings by replacing '?' with the decided values and prints them.
   - It ensures that the output matrix remains symmetric by using the input matrix `xx` and only replacing '?'.

### Analysis:

- **Balancing Transitions:**
  - The program's approach to balancing the transitions by assigning 'F' and 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` is not robust enough to guarantee that the requirement of no more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type will be met for all permutations of scenarios.
  - For example, if `sa` or `sb` contains fewer than `n // 4 - 1` elements, the program might assign too many 'F' or 'S' transitions, potentially leading to more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of known transitions is very low or very high, which could lead to incorrect assignments.
  - Specifically, if there are very few known transitions, the program might not have enough information to make a balanced decision, leading to potential violations of the `3n/4` constraint.

- **Symmetry:**
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix is symmetric by reading the input and storing it in `xx`, and it correctly maintains this symmetry in the output.
  - However, the symmetry alone does not guarantee that the `3n/4` constraint is met for all permutations.

### Conclusion:

The program's approach to balancing the transitions is not sufficient to guarantee that no more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type will occur for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Final: False**
