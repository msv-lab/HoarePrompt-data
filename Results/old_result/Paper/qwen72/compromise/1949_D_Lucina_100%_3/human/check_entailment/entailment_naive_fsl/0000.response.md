Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no permutation of the scenarios should have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type in a row. Specifically, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters is flawed. The program attempts to assign 'F' or 'S' based on the number of pre-assigned 'F' or 'S' transitions for each scenario, but this approach does not guarantee that the final assignment will meet the requirement for all permutations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
??.?.
```
The program might produce the following output:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FSSF.
FFFF.
```
However, if the player plays the scenarios in the order [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the sequence of transition videos would be "F F S S", which does not exceed the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type. But if the player plays the scenarios in the order [1, 3, 2, 4, 5], the sequence of transition videos would be "F F F F", which exceeds the limit of 4 consecutive videos of the same type.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.
