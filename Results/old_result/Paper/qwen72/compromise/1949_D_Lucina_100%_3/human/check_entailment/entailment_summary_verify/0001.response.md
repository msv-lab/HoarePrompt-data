### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and initializes arrays `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Known Transitions:**
   - The program reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row in the transition matrix.
   - For each character in the input string, it updates the counts in `a` and `b` if the character is 'F' or 'S', respectively.
   - The input string is stored in `xx` for later use.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions:**
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - This step is crucial for understanding the distribution of known transitions and helps in deciding the transitions for the undecided pairs.

4. **Deciding Transitions for Undecided Pairs:**
   - The program decides the transitions for the undecided pairs ('?') based on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`.
   - If `sa` is longer or equal to `sb`, it tries to balance the number of funny and scary transitions by assigning 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - If `sb` is longer, it does the opposite, assigning 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sb` and 'F' to the rest.
   - This approach is intended to ensure that no more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The program constructs the output strings by replacing '?' with the decided values and prints them.
   - The output matrix is symmetric by construction, as it is derived from the symmetric input matrix.

### Analysis:

- **Balancing Transitions:**
  - The program's logic for balancing the transitions is based on the cumulative counts of 'F' and 'S' in each scenario. However, the logic of assigning 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest (and vice versa for `sb`) is not robust enough to ensure that the requirement is met for all permutations of scenarios.
  - The requirement is that no more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type should occur. The current logic does not consider the overall sequence of transitions but rather focuses on individual scenarios, which may not be sufficient to meet the requirement.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not handle edge cases where the number of known transitions is very low or very high, which could lead to incorrect assignments.
  - For example, if there are very few known transitions, the program might not have enough information to make a balanced decision, potentially leading to a sequence with more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type.

- **Symmetry:**
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix is symmetric by reading the input and storing it in `xx`, and it maintains this symmetry in the output.

### Conclusion:

The program's approach to balancing the transitions is not sufficient to guarantee that no more than `3n/4` consecutive transitions of the same type will occur for all permutations of scenarios. The logic for assigning transitions to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios is not robust and may not always result in a valid solution. Therefore, the program is not correct.

**Final: False**
