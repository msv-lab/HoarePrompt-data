Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, and `j` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if x[j - 1] == 'F':
        a[i] += 1
        a[j] += 1
    elif x[j - 1] == 'S':
        b[i] += 1
        b[j] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, `j` is 1. If the second character of `x` is 'F', then `a[1]` is incremented by 1. If the second character of `x` is not 'F' and the first character of `x` is 'S', then `b[1]` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, `j` is 2. If the third character of `x` is 'F', `a[2]` is increased by 1 and `a[3]` is increased by 1. If the third character of `x` is 'S', the value at index 2 of list `b` is incremented by 1. If the third character of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, `j` is 3. If the third character of `x` is 'F', `a[2]` and `a[3]` are both increased by 1. If the third character of `x` is 'S', the value at index 2 of list `b` is incremented by 1. If the third character of `x` is neither 'F' nor 'S', the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
