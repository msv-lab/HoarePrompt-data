Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list containing `n + 1` strings. If `b[3]` is greater than 0 and `a[3]` is 0, `sa` is a list containing the integer 3, and `sb` is a list containing the integers 2 and 3. Otherwise, `sa` is a list containing the integer 3, and `sb` remains as it was initially, now containing the integer 2.***
