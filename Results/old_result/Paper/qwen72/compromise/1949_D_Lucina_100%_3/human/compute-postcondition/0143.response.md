Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 24, `a[1]` to `a[n]` and `b[1]` to `b[n]` are unchanged, `sa` is a list that includes all indices from 1 to `n` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0, `j` is 3, `nx` is now `nx` + 'S'.**

The value of `nx` is updated by appending the character 'S' to its current value. All other variables remain unchanged.
