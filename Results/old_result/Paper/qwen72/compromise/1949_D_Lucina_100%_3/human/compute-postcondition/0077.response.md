Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 3, `x` is a new input string, `xx` is a list that now includes the new input string `x` as its last element, `j` is 2. If the third character of `x` (i.e., `x[2]`) is 'S', the value at index 2 of list `b` is incremented by 1.***
