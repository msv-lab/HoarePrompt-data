Output State: **`n` is an integer provided by the user such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1, `x` is an input string, and `j` is `n`. For each index `k` from 1 to `n` in the input string `x`, if `x[k - 1]` is 'F', both `a[k]` and `a[1]` are incremented by 1. If `x[k - 1]` is 'S', both `b[k]` and `b[1]` are incremented by 1. If `x[k - 1]` is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes are made to `a[k]` or `b[k]`.**

In natural language: After the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be `n`. For each character in the input string `x` at position `k` (from 1 to `n`), if the character is 'F', both `a[k]` and `a[1]` will be incremented by 1. If the character is 'S', both `b[k]` and `b[1]` will be incremented by 1. If the character is neither 'F' nor 'S', no changes will be made to `a[k]` or `b[k]`. The initial values of `i` and `x` remain unchanged.
