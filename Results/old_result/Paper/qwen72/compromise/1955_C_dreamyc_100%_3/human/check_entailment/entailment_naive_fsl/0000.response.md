Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the Kraken attacks the ships in the specified alternating pattern (first, last, first, last, etc.). The function `func_1` does not simulate the attacks in the correct order and does not properly account for the ships that have sunk. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 5
1 2 4 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
3
```

The program incorrectly counts the number of ships sunk. According to the problem description, the Kraken should attack the ships in the following order:
1. First ship: durability becomes 0, sinks. Remaining ships: [2, 4, 3].
2. Last ship: durability becomes 2. Remaining ships: [2, 4, 2].
3. First ship: durability becomes 1. Remaining ships: [1, 4, 2].
4. Last ship: durability becomes 1. Remaining ships: [1, 4, 1].
5. First ship: durability becomes 0, sinks. Remaining ships: [4, 1].

After 5 attacks, 2 ships should have sunk, but the program returns 3. This indicates that the logic for handling the attacks and counting the sunk ships is flawed.
