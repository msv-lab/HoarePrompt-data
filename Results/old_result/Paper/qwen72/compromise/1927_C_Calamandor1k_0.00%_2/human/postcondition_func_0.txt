The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of two lists `a` and `b` respectively, and `k` is an even integer. It then reads the lists `a` and `b` from the input. The function checks if at least `k // 2` elements in both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. If this condition is met for both lists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0 and the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `d`, `i`, `count_a`, and `count_b` holding the values from the last iteration.
