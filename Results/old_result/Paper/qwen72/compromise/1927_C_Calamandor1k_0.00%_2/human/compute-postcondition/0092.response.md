Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new lists of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 1, `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 0. If `len_a` is greater than 2 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is 1 or 2 (2 if `a[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise 1). If `len_a` is not greater than 2, then `count_a` is 0 or 1 (1 if `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise 0). If `len_b` is greater than 1 and `b[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_b` is 1; otherwise, `count_b` remains 0. If `b[i]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_b` is incremented by 1.***
