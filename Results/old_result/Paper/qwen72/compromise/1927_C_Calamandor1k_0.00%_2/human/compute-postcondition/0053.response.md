The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i`, `len_a`, and `len_b`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `max(len_a, len_b)` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 1, and `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than 1. If `len_a` is greater than 1 and `a[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 0. If `len_b` is greater than 1 and `b[0]` is less than or equal to `k`, `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 1. Otherwise, `count_a` and `count_b` remain 0.**
