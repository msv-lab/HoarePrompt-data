Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should take three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `b` is a list of integers of length `m`, and `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * min(n, m). The lengths `n` and `m` are such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6. `t` is an input integer.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
    count_a, count_b = 0, 0
    d = k // 2
    for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
        if len_a > i + 1:
            if a[i] <= k:
                count_a += 1
        if len_b > i + 1:
            if b[i] <= k:
                count_b += 1
    print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` and `b` are lists of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k` divided by 2 (integer division), `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_a - 1`. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `len_b - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, and `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than or equal to 0. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `a` and `b` are new lists of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, and `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than or equal to 0. `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and are within the first `max(len_a, len_b) - 1` elements. `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and are within the first `max(len_a, len_b) - 1` elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
