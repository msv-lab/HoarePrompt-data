Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1`, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of `a`, `len_b` is the length of `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is 0, and `max(len_a, len_b)` must be greater than 0. If `len_a` is greater than 1 and the first element of `a` (i.e., `a[0]`) is less than or equal to `k`, then `count_a` is 1 and `count_b` is 0. Otherwise, `count_a` and `count_b` remain 0. Additionally, the current value of `len_b` is greater than `i + 1` (which is 1). The current value of `b[i]` (which is `b[0]`) is less than or equal to `k`.**
