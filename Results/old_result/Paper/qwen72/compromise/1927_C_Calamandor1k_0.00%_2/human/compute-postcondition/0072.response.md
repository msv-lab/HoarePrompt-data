Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values of the input integers, `t` is `t - 1` and must be greater than 0, `a` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `b` is a new list of integers provided by the user, `len_a` is the length of the new `a`, `len_b` is the length of the new `b`, `d` is equal to `k // 2`, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1`, and `max(len_a, len_b)` is greater than or equal to 0. `count_a` is the number of elements in the new `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. `count_b` is the number of elements in the new `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`. The new `b` is a list of integers provided by the user.**
