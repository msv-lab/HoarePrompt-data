#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `k`. `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `b` is a list of integers of length `m`, and `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2 * min(n, m). The lengths `n` and `m` are such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `n`, `m`, and `k` are the values of the input integers from the last iteration, `a` and `b` are the lists of integers provided by the user in the last iteration, `len_a` is the length of `a` from the last iteration, `len_b` is the length of `b` from the last iteration, `d` is equal to `k // 2` from the last iteration, `i` is `max(len_a, len_b) - 1` from the last iteration, `count_a` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`, and `count_b` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and have an index less than `max(len_a, len_b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, where `n` and `m` are the lengths of two lists `a` and `b` respectively, and `k` is an even integer. It then reads the lists `a` and `b` from the input. The function checks if at least `k // 2` elements in both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. If this condition is met for both lists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with `t` being 0 and the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `len_a`, `len_b`, `d`, `i`, `count_a`, and `count_b` holding the values from the last iteration.
