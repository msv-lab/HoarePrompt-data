Precondition: **n is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.** 

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description, as it should accept additional parameters to handle the number of moves `k` and the specific moves `r_i` and `c_i`. The correct function definition should be:

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of moves `[(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), ..., (r_k, c_k)]`.

Given this, the precondition should be updated to:

Precondition: **t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n) and a list of `k` moves `[(r_1, c_1), (r_2, c_2), ..., (r_k, c_k)]` where `r_i` and `c_i` are integers (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing the row and column of the i-th move.**
