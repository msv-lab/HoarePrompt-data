### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads `k` moves, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Handling Moves:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, the program checks if `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - If `a` is not equal to `b`, it reduces `n` by 2 because both the player and the computer place a rook, and these rooks occupy two different rows and columns.
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, it reduces `n` by 1 because only the player places a rook, and the computer skips its turn.
   - This logic is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Dynamic Programming for Counting Configurations:**
   - The function `func_1(n)` is used to compute the number of possible final configurations.
   - The dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, representing the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - The DP transition is defined as:
     \[
     dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]
     \]
     This transition accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in an `i x i` board:
     - `dp[i-1]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in a `(i-1) x (i-1)` board.
     - `2 * (i-1) * dp[i-2]` represents the number of ways to place a rook in the `i-th` row and column, and then place rooks in the remaining `(i-2) x (i-2)` board.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the results are within the required range of `10^9 + 7`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case.

### Function Summary Validation:
- The function `func_1` correctly computes the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming.
- The DP transition formula is correct and matches the problem's requirements.
- The function maintains a rolling window of the last two DP states to optimize space usage, which is efficient and correct.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly handles the input and test cases.
- The logic for reducing `n` based on the moves is correct.
- The dynamic programming approach for counting the configurations is correct and matches the problem's requirements.
- The modulo operation ensures that the results are within the required range.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
