### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and updates the value of `n` based on whether the move is mirrored or not.

2. **Move Validation and Board Size Update:**
   - For each move `(a, b)`, if `a != b`, the program decreases `n` by 2 because both the player and the computer place a rook, and they are in different rows and columns.
   - If `a == b`, the program decreases `n` by 1 because the player places a rook, but the computer skips its turn.

3. **Dynamic Programming Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to compute the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard given the remaining size `n`.
   - The dynamic programming list `dp` is initialized with `[1, 1]`, which represents the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`.
   - The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, updating the `dp` list to store the current and previous states.
   - The update formula `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)` is correct for calculating the number of configurations. This formula accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the current row and column while ensuring no two rooks attack each other.
   - The `dp.pop(0)` operation ensures that the `dp` list only keeps the last two states, which is efficient and necessary for the dynamic programming approach.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the result of `func_1(n)` for each test case, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program follows the problem description accurately and uses a correct dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. The input parsing, move validation, and dynamic programming calculations are all implemented correctly.

**Correctness: **True****
