The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented to 3.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with two elements: [3, 7], `i` is 3**
