Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with two elements: [dp[n-2], dp[n-1]]; `i` is n.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is the size of the chessboard and is not modified within the loop.
- The list `dp` initially starts with two elements, both set to 1. After each iteration of the loop, the list `dp` is updated by appending a new element and removing the first element. The new element is calculated as `(dp[-1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[-2]) % (7 + 10 ** 9)`.
- After `n` iterations, the list `dp` will contain the last two values of the sequence generated by the loop. Specifically, `dp[0]` will be the value of `dp` at the `(n-2)`-th iteration, and `dp[1]` will be the value of `dp` at the `(n-1)`-th iteration.
- The variable `i` will be equal to `n` after the loop has completed all its iterations.
