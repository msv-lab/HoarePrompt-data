The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3, and `n` must still be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the size of the chessboard, and it is guaranteed that 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5; `dp` is a list with two elements: [1, 3]; `i` is 3**
