Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, and `vt` is 0. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of the first character of `a` plus the second character of `a` plus the third character of `a`, and `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` or `b` depending on the initial condition, followed by the second character of `a`, and the third character of `a`. If the second character of `a` is not equal to the second character of `b`, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `a` or `b` (whichever is smaller), and `y` is the integer value of the second character of `a` or `b` (whichever is larger). If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y` concatenated to the previous value of `kq2`. If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` <= `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`.**
