Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `b` is an input string, `i` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are set to the first character of `a` (or `b`), and the `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `x` is the smaller integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b`, and `y` is the larger integer value of the first characters of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the string representation of `y`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the string representation of `x`.***
