Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 1, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `a`, `y` is the integer value of the second character of `b` if the second character of `a` is less than or equal to the second character of `b`; otherwise, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `b` and `y` is the integer value of the second character of `a`, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1` (if `kq1` was previously defined) or is simply the string representation of `y` (if `kq1` was not previously defined).**
