Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            if a[i] > b[i]:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`i` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 1 character, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 0. If the first character of `a` is equal to the first character of `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are both set to the first character of `a`. If the first character of `a` is not equal to the first character of `b`, `x` is the integer value of the first character of `a`, `y` is the integer value of the first character of `b`. If `vt` is 0 and the first character of `a` is greater than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `y`. If `vt` is 0 and the first character of `a` is less than the first character of `b`, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is set to the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is set to the string representation of `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, `vt` is 0. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of the first character of `a` plus the second character of `a`, and `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` or `b` depending on the initial condition, followed by the second character of `a`. If the second character of `a` is not equal to the second character of `b`, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `a`, `y` is the integer value of the second character of `b` if the second character of `a` is less than or equal to the second character of `b`; otherwise, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `b` and `y` is the integer value of the second character of `a`. If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is a string that includes the integer value of the second character of `a` as its first character, and `kq2` is a string that includes the integer value of `y` as its first character. If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` <= `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1` (if `kq1` was previously defined) or is simply the string representation of `y` (if `kq1` was not previously defined), and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2` (if `kq2` was previously defined) or is simply the string representation of `x` (if `kq2` was not previously defined). If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `a` is an input string with at least 3 characters, `t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 1, `b` is an input string with at least `len(a)` characters, and `vt` is 0. If the second character of `a` is equal to the second character of `b`, `kq1` is the string representation of the first character of `a` plus the second character of `a` plus the third character of `a`, and `kq2` is the string representation of the first character of `a` or `b` depending on the initial condition, followed by the second character of `a`, and the third character of `a`. If the second character of `a` is not equal to the second character of `b`, `x` is the integer value of the second character of `a` or `b` (whichever is smaller), and `y` is the integer value of the second character of `a` or `b` (whichever is larger). If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `y` concatenated to the previous value of `kq2`. If `vt` is 0 and `a[i]` <= `b[i]`, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`. If `vt` is not 0, `kq1` is the string representation of `y` appended to the previous value of `kq1`, and `kq2` is the string representation of `x` appended to the previous value of `kq2`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
