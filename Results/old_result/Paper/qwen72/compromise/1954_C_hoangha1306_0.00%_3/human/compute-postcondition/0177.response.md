Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 3 characters, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1. If `a[i]` == `b[i]`, `kq1` and `kq2` are each concatenated with the third character of `a`. If `a[i]` != `b[i]`, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 in `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 in `a` and `b`. If `vt` == 0 and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`. If `vt` == 0 and `a[i]` <= `b[i]`, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` != 0, `kq1` is concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is concatenated with the string representation of `x`.***
