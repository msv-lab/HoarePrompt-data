Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 0, `a` is an input string with at least 2 characters, `b` is an input string, `i` is 1, `x` is the smaller integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `y` is the larger integer value of the second characters of `a` and `b`, `kq1` is a string containing the value of `y`.**

Explanation:
- `kq1` is updated by concatenating the string representation of `y` to it.
- The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
