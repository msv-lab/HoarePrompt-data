Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `a` and `b` are input strings with at least 3 characters, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `q` is 2, `vt` is 0 or 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 in `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 in `a` and `b`. If `vt` == 0 and `a[i]` > `b[i]`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `x`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `y`. If `vt` == 0 and `a[i]` <= `b[i]`, `kq1` is the original `kq1` concatenated with the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` concatenated with the string representation of `x`. If `vt` != 0, `kq1` is the original `kq1` string plus the string representation of `y`, and `kq2` is the original `kq2` string plus the string representation of `x`.***
