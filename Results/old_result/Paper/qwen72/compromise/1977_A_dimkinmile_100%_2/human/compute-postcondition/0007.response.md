Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, where both integers are expected to be between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function then checks if the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, and either 'Yes' or 'No' has been printed to the console. **
