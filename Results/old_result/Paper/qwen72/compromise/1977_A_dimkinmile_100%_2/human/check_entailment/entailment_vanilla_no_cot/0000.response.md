Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the logic for determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not sufficient to determine the correctness of the solution. 

The correct condition should be whether `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even. This is because:
- `n` must be at least `m` to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- The difference `n - m` must be even because each "put" and "remove" operation can be paired to cancel each other out, and the remaining operations must be exactly `m` "put" operations.

The correct condition should be:
```python
if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
    print('Yes')
else:
    print('No')
```

Here is the corrected program:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```
