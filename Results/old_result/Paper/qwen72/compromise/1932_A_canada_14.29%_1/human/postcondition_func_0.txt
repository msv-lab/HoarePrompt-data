The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves a string `s` of up to 50 characters consisting of '.', '@', or '*'. For each test case, it counts the number of '@' characters encountered before the first occurrence of two consecutive '*' characters. It prints this count for each test case and does not return any value. The state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the counts of '@' characters for each test case have been printed. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are not modified.
