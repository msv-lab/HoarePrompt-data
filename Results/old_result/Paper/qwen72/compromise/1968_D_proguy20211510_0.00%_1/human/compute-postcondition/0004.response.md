Output State: **For each of the t test cases, the loop will print either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the conditions within the loop. The variables `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, `a`, `maxa`, `b`, `s`, `preb`, `pres`, `ptsb`, `ptss`, `maxs`, `maxb`, `sb`, `ss`, `founds`, and `foundb` will be updated and used within the loop, but their final values will not be relevant outside of the loop. The loop will execute t times, and the output for each test case will be determined by the conditions specified in the loop.**
