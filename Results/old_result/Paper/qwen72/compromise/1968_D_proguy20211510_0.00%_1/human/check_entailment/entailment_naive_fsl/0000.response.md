Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to simulate the game for the full duration of \( k \) turns as required. Instead, it prematurely stops the simulation once it finds the maximum value in the array \( a \) and assumes that the player who reaches this maximum value first will continue to accumulate this maximum value for the remaining turns. This assumption is incorrect because the game's rules allow players to either stay at their current position or move to \( p_x \), and the optimal strategy might involve staying at a position with a high score rather than moving to the position with the maximum score.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Bodya
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output "Draw" because it finds that neither Bodya nor Sasha are at the position with the maximum score (which is 7 at position 1) after the first turn, and it does not correctly simulate the second turn.

**Correct Simulation:**
- **First Turn:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3, score = 5.
  - Sasha starts at position 2, score = 2.
  - Both players move to their respective positions in the permutation.
  - Bodya moves to position 2, score = 5 + 2 = 7.
  - Sasha moves to position 1, score = 2 + 7 = 9.

- **Second Turn:**
  - Bodya is now at position 2, score = 7.
  - Sasha is now at position 1, score = 9.
  - Bodya can stay at position 2 or move to position 1.
  - Sasha can stay at position 1 or move to position 4.
  - If Bodya stays at position 2, his score becomes 7 + 2 = 9.
  - If Sasha stays at position 1, his score remains 9.

In this case, Bodya can achieve a score of 9, which is equal to Sasha's score. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" because it does not correctly simulate the second turn and the optimal strategies for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
