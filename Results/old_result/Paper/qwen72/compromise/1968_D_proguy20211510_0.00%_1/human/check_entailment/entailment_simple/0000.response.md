Reasoning:

The program aims to simulate the "Permutation game" as described, where two players, Bodya and Sasha, start at different positions in a permutation and move according to the rules, accumulating scores based on the values in the array `a`. The goal is to determine the winner after `k` turns.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` and converts them to lists of integers.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if both players start at positions with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - It checks if Bodya starts at a position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - It checks if Sasha starts at a position with the maximum value in `a`. If so, it prints "Sasha" and continues.

3. **Simulation of the Game:**
   - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns.
   - It uses two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It uses boolean flags `foundb` and `founds` to track if Bodya or Sasha has moved to a position with the maximum value in `a`.
   - For each turn, it updates the scores and positions based on the rules of the game.

4. **Optimization for Large `k`:**
   - If both players have found a position with the maximum value in `a`, the program optimizes by adding the remaining turns' scores directly, as the score will not change further.

5. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the total possible scores for each player after `k` turns using `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - It compares the maximum possible scores and prints the winner or "Draw" accordingly.

### Potential Issues:
- **Incorrect Initial Checks:**
  - The initial checks only consider the starting positions and the maximum value in `a`. However, the game's outcome depends on the cumulative scores over `k` turns, not just the initial positions.
  - For example, if both players start at positions with high but not maximum values, the program might incorrectly determine the winner based on the initial checks.

- **Simulation Logic:**
  - The simulation logic is correct in terms of updating scores and positions.
  - However, the optimization for large `k` might not be accurate. If a player reaches a position with the maximum value in `a` and stays there, their score will indeed be maximized, but the program should consider the possibility of other positions contributing to the score.

- **Final Comparison:**
  - The final comparison of maximum possible scores is correct, but the program should ensure that it correctly handles all edge cases, especially when `k` is large and the scores can be very high.

### Conclusion:
The program has some logical flaws in the initial checks and the optimization for large `k`. The initial checks should be more comprehensive to consider the cumulative scores over `k` turns, not just the starting positions. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

Correctness: **False**
