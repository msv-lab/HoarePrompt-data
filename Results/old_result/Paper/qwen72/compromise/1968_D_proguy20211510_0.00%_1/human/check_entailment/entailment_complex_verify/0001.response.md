### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases, the game parameters (n, k, pb, ps), the permutation array `p`, and the score array `a`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program first checks if both Bodya and Sasha are initially on the position with the maximum score (`maxa`). If so, it prints "Draw" and continues to the next test case.
   - If only Bodya is on the position with the maximum score, it prints "Bodya" and continues.
   - If only Sasha is on the position with the maximum score, it prints "Sasha" and continues.
   - These checks are valid because if a player starts on the position with the maximum score, they will always have the highest score if they stay there.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program simulates the game for `k` turns. It maintains two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores of Bodya and Sasha at each turn.
   - It also uses two boolean flags `founds` and `foundb` to track if either player has found the position with the maximum score and decided to stay there.
   - For each turn, it updates the scores and positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the rules of the game.
   - The logic for updating scores and positions is correct, but the program could be optimized to detect cycles in the permutation to avoid unnecessary simulations for large `k`.

4. **Prefix Sums:**
   - The program calculates the prefix sums of the scores for Bodya and Sasha (`preb` and `pres`), which are the cumulative scores up to each turn.
   - This step is necessary for the next step to calculate the optimal scores.

5. **Optimal Scores:**
   - The program then calculates the optimal scores for Bodya and Sasha (`ptsb` and `ptss`). The optimal score is the score a player can achieve if they stay at the position with the maximum score for the remaining turns.
   - This is done by adding the remaining turns' maximum score to the current cumulative score.
   - The logic for calculating the optimal scores is correct.

6. **Determine the Winner:**
   - The program compares the maximum optimal scores of Bodya and Sasha (`maxb` and `maxs`).
   - If `maxs` is greater than `maxb`, it prints "Sasha".
   - If `maxb` is greater than `maxs`, it prints "Bodya".
   - If `maxs` is equal to `maxb`, it prints "Draw".
   - The logic for determining the winner is correct.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Variables:**
  - The variables `YES`, `NO`, and `alpha` are defined but not used in the program. These can be safely removed.
- **Modulo Operation:**
  - The variable `MOD` is defined but not used in the program. This can also be removed.
- **Efficiency:**
  - The program simulates the game for up to `k` turns, which could be inefficient for large `k` (up to \(10^9\)). However, since the game is played on a permutation, the positions will eventually cycle, and the program could be optimized to detect cycles and avoid unnecessary simulations.
  - Despite this inefficiency, the program will still produce the correct output for the given inputs, as it correctly follows the game rules.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the rules of the game and determines the winner based on the given inputs. The logic is sound, and the output is correct for the provided test cases. The presence of unused variables and potential inefficiency for large `k` do not affect the correctness of the program for the given problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
