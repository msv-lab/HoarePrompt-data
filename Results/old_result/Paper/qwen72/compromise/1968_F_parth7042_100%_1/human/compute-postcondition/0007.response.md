To determine what will be printed by the `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `index` is the integer value of `len(data)`. This means `index` is the length of the list `data`.
- `results` is a list of strings containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `pf`, and `mp` are no longer relevant as they are local to the loop and will be overwritten in each iteration.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`results` List**: The `results` list contains strings, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO'. The exact number of elements in `results` is not specified, but it is implied that it corresponds to the number of queries processed.
2. **`'\n'.join(results)`**: This expression joins all the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
3. **`print` Statement**: The `print` statement will output the joined string to the console.

### Output Calculation:
- Since `results` is a list of strings, each string in the list will be printed on a new line.
- The exact content of `results` is not provided, but it is known that each element is either 'YES' or 'NO'.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print each string in the `results` list, one per line. The exact number of lines and the specific content ('YES' or 'NO') of each line depends on the queries processed and the logic that determined the values in `results`.

Output: **[each element of results on a new line, where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO']**
