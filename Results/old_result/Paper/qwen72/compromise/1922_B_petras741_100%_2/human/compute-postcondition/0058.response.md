The code snippet `q[w[j]] += 1` increments the value at the index `w[j]` in the list `q` by 1. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, so `w[j]` refers to `w[1]`. Therefore, the element at index `w[1]` in the list `q` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros except for the element at index `w[0]`, which is 1, and the element at index `w[1]`, which is now 1, `j` is 1.**
