Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `w` representing the exponents of the lengths of sticks. The function calculates and prints the number of ways to choose three sticks such that the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0 for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates with no return value. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `w` are consumed and not modified. **
