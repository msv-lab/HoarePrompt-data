Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer, and `w` is a list of integers input by the user.**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to an integer provided by the user.
- The values of `t`, `i`, and `w` remain unchanged.
- The initial state specifies that `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and `w` is a list of integers input by the user, which are still valid after the execution of the code snippet.
- The value of `n` is now an input integer, which could be any integer value depending on the user's input.
