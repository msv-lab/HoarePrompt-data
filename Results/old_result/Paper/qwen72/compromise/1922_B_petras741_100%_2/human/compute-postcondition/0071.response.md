Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer that must be at least 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is 2, `eta` is a list that now contains the integer 2. If `q[1]` is greater than 0, `eta` originally contained the integer 1, and now contains both 1 and 2. Otherwise, `eta` was an empty list and now contains the integer 2.**
