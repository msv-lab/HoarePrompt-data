The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `j` is initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `j` is 0**
