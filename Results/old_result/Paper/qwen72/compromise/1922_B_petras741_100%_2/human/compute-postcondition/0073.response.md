Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is `n`, and `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- The variable `t` remains greater than 0.
- The variable `i` remains 1.
- The variable `n` remains the input integer.
- The variable `w` remains the list of integers input by the user.
- The variable `q` is a list of length `n + 1`, where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in the range `n`) has been incremented by 1.
- The variable `j` is now `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
- The variable `eta` is a list that contains all the indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where the corresponding element in `q` is greater than 0.
