Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` from 0 to `n` where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`.** 

The variable `eta_ln` is assigned the length of the list `eta`, which contains the indices from 0 to `n` where the corresponding elements in `q` are greater than 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
