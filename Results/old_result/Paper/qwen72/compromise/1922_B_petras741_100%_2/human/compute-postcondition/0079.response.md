Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the input integer, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `w[j]` (for `j` in range `n`) is incremented by 1, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing all indices `j` (from 0 to `n`) where `q[j]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, `res` is equal to `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is calculated using the formula `q[eta[0]] * (q[eta[0]] - 1) * (q[eta[0]] - 2) // 6`.
- `rho` is equal to `q[eta[0]]`, so `res` can be expressed as `rho * (rho - 1) * (rho - 2) // 6`.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`, `j`, `eta`, `eta_ln`, `rho`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
