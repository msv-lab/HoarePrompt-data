Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer greater than or equal to 3, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `q` is a list of `n + 1` zeros with `q[w[j]]` incremented by 1 for each `j` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list containing the value 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `eta.append(j)` adds the value of `j` to the list `eta`.
- Given that `j` is 1, `eta` now contains the value 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `n`, `w`, `q`) remain unchanged.
- The condition for `eta` being either an empty list or a list containing 0 is no longer valid, as `eta` now contains 1.
