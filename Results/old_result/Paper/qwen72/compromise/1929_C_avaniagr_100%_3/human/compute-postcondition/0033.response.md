To determine what will be printed by the `print('YES')` statement, we need to analyze the initial state and the conditions provided. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file.
   - `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file.
   - `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file.
   - `s` is the third line of the input file.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If \(x < k - 1\):
     - If \(a \geq x + 1\), the condition \(a \geq x + 1\) holds.
     - If \(a < x + 1\), the condition \(a < x + 1\) holds.
   - If \(x = k - 1\):
     - If \(a \geq x + 2\), the program follows the postcondition of the if part.
     - If \(a < x + 2\), the program follows the postcondition of the else part.
   - If \(x \geq k - 2\) and \(x \neq k - 1\):
     - \(i = x - k + 2\).
     - \(z\) is the result of the loop body being applied \(x - k + 3\) times.
     - If \(a \geq z\), the program retains these conditions.
     - If \(a < z\), the program also retains these conditions.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print('YES')` statement is a simple print statement that does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Since the `print('YES')` statement is not influenced by the values of `t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, or `s`, and it always prints the string `'YES'`, the output is straightforward.

Output: **YES**
