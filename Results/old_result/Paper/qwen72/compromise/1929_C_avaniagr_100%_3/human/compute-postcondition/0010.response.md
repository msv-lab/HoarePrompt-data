Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, `s` is the second line of the input file, and `k`, `x`, and `a` are assigned the integer values from the second line of the input file. Additionally, `x` is equal to `k - 1`, and the current value of `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 2`.**
