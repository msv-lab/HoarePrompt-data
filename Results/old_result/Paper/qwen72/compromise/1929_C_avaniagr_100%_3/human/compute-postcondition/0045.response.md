Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is the first integer from the third line of the input file, `x` is the second integer from the third line of the input file, `a` is the third integer from the third line of the input file, `s` is the third line of the input file, `z` is updated to `z + z // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 2, and `x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 2.**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` is updated by adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to itself.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, `i`) and conditions (`x - k + 3` must be greater than or equal to 2) remain unchanged.
