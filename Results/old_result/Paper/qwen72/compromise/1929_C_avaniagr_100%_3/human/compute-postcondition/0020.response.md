Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `k` is an integer where 2 <= k <= 30, `x` is an integer where 1 <= x <= 100 and x is greater than or equal to k - 2 and not equal to k - 1, `a` is an integer where 1 <= a <= 10^9, `s` is the second line of the input file, `z` is now equal to `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`, and `i` is 1.**

Explanation:
- The value of `z` was initially `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- The code `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` updates `z` by adding the result of `z // (k - 1) + 1` to the current value of `z`.
- Therefore, the new value of `z` is `k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1 + (k - 2 + (k - 2) // (k - 1) + 1) // (k - 1) + 1`.
- All other variables (`t`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, `i`) remain unchanged.
