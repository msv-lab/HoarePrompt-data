### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is not ideal for clarity, but it works because the inputs are taken directly from `input()`.
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the input for each test case, including `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and converts them to integers.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` as lists of integers.

3. **Tracking Paths:**
   - The function initializes two empty lists `pathb` and `paths` to track the scores of Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It also initializes a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid infinite loops.

4. **Simulating the Game:**
   - For Bodya, the function starts at position `P_B` and appends the score at each position to `pathb` until it encounters a visited position.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, the function starts at position `P_S` and appends the score at each position to `paths` until it encounters a visited position.

5. **Calculating Scores:**
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha by iterating through their respective paths.
   - It uses a formula to calculate the score for each turn, considering the number of turns left and the cumulative score.

6. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After calculating the scores, the function compares them to determine the winner and prints the result.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Variables:**
  - The variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` are defined but not used in the function. These can be removed to clean up the code.
- **Potential Infinite Loop:**
  - The function uses a `while True` loop to track the paths, which can potentially lead to an infinite loop if the permutation is not a valid permutation (though the problem guarantees valid inputs). However, the `vis` list should prevent this by breaking the loop when a position is revisited.
- **Score Calculation:**
  - The score calculation seems to be correct, but it could be more clearly documented or optimized for readability.

### Conclusion:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. It handles the input, simulates the game, and determines the winner based on the scores. The only issues are the presence of unused variables and potential readability improvements, but these do not affect the correctness of the function.

### Correctness:
**True**
