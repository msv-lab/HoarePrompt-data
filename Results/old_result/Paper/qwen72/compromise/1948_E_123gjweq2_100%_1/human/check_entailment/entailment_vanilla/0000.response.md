### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses a function `func_1` to determine the number of cliques and assign values to the vertices.
   - It also uses a helper function `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculates the minimum number of cliques needed. The idea is to divide the vertices into groups of size at most k, which is a reasonable approach.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` iterates over each clique.
   - `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)`: This function call is intended to populate the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for the current clique. The parameters are:
     - `left`: The starting index of the current clique.
     - `right`: The ending index of the current clique.
     - `clique`: The clique number.

4. **Function `make_array` Analysis:**
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These variables are used to determine the range of values to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: This calculates the midpoint of the range of values.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This calculates the number of elements that are not in the midpoint range.
   - The first loop `for i in range(mid)` assigns the smaller values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving backwards.
   - The second loop `for i in range(not_mid)` assigns the larger values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving forwards.

5. **Checking the Edge Condition:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) should be satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - The way `make_array` assigns values ensures that within each clique, the difference \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \) is minimized, which helps in forming cliques.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution appears to correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and assign values to the vertices such that the edge condition is satisfied. The logic and implementation seem to align with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
