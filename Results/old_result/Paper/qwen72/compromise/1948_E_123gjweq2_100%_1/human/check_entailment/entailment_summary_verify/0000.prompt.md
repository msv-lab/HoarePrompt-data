You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

- Program:
from math import ceil
#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

#Function 2:
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` ≤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function updates two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, in place. After the function concludes, the elements of `arr` from index `left` to `right` are set such that the first half of the range (from `left` to `left + mid - 1`) contains values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`, and the second half (from `left + mid` to `right`) contains values from `right + 1 - not_mid` to `right + 1`. The elements of `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are all set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is larger than `n`. According to the problem description, `k` can be up to `2n`, but the program's logic for determining the number of cliques and assigning elements to these cliques is based on the assumption that `k` is less than or equal to `n`. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `n = 5` and `k = 10`. The program will calculate `cliques = ceil(5 / 10) = 1`, which means it will try to fit all vertices into a single clique. However, the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` will always be true for any `i` and `j` because `k` is so large. This means the graph should be a complete graph (a single clique), but the program's logic for assigning elements to the clique is flawed and may not produce a valid assignment.

Here is a specific example:
- Input: `n = 5`, `k = 10`
- Expected Output: The program should output a single clique with all vertices, and a valid assignment of `a_i` values.
- Actual Output: The program will output an incorrect assignment of `a_i` values and cliques, potentially leading to a graph that is not correctly partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
