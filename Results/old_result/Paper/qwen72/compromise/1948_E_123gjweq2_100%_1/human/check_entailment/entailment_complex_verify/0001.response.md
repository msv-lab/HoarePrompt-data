### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires assigning distinct integers from 1 to n to each vertex and then partitioning the graph into the minimum number of cliques based on the edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution:**
   - The solution uses `func_1` to determine the number of cliques and assign values to the vertices.
   - It uses `make_array` to fill the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with the appropriate values.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `cliques = ceil(n / k)`: This calculation is correct. It determines the minimum number of cliques needed by dividing the vertices into groups of size at most k.
   - `arr = [0] * n` and `cliquess = [0] * n`: These arrays are correctly initialized to store the assigned values and the clique assignments, respectively.
   - The loop `for i in range(cliques)` iterates over each clique.
   - `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)`: This function call is intended to populate the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays for the current clique. The parameters are:
     - `left`: The starting index of the current clique.
     - `right`: The ending index of the current clique.
     - `clique`: The clique number.

4. **Function `make_array` Analysis:**
   - `small_element = left + 1` and `big_element = right + 1`: These variables correctly determine the range of values to be assigned to the vertices in the current clique.
   - `mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`: This correctly calculates the midpoint of the range of values.
   - `not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid`: This correctly calculates the number of elements that are not in the midpoint range.
   - The first loop `for i in range(mid)` assigns the smaller values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving backwards.
   - The second loop `for i in range(not_mid)` assigns the larger values to the vertices in the current clique, starting from the midpoint and moving forwards.

5. **Checking the Edge Condition:**
   - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) should be satisfied for all pairs of vertices within the same clique.
   - The way `make_array` assigns values ensures that within each clique, the difference \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \) is minimized, which helps in forming cliques. Specifically, the values are assigned in a way that the difference between the indices and the values is small enough to satisfy the edge condition.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the assigned values, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments, which matches the required output format.

### Validation of Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The `arr` and `cliquess` arrays are updated as described, ensuring that the values and clique assignments are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques and assigns values to the vertices such that the edge condition is satisfied. The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
