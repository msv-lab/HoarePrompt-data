### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to `n` to each vertex.
   - We need to create a graph where an edge is added between vertices `i` and `j` if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques, where each vertex belongs to exactly one clique.

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
     - It calls `make_array` to fill segments of `arr` and `cliquess` with values.
     - It prints the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values of `cliquess`.

   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - It fills the segment of `arr` from `left` to `right` with a specific pattern of values.
     - It sets the corresponding segment of `cliquess` to the value of `clique`.
     - The pattern ensures that the first half of the segment is filled with increasing values, and the second half is filled with decreasing values.

3. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - **Distinct Integers:**
     - The function `make_array` ensures that each segment of `arr` contains distinct integers from `left + 1` to `right + 1`.
     - Since `left` and `right` are calculated based on the segment length `k`, and each segment is filled with distinct integers, the entire `arr` will contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

   - **Edge Condition:**
     - The edge condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) needs to be satisfied for vertices `i` and `j` to be connected.
     - The pattern in `make_array` ensures that the values in `arr` are arranged such that the difference \( |a_i - a_j| \) is minimized within each segment.
     - This minimization, combined with the segment length `k`, ensures that the edge condition is met for vertices within the same segment.

   - **Clique Partition:**
     - The function `func_1` divides the vertices into `ceil(n / k)` segments.
     - Each segment is treated as a separate clique, and the `cliquess` array is updated to reflect this.
     - Since the edge condition is met within each segment, each segment forms a clique.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`:
     - `cliques = ceil(2 / 3) = 1`.
     - `arr = [2, 1]` and `cliquess = [1, 1]`.
     - The edge condition \( |1 - 2| + |2 - 1| = 2 \le 3 \) is satisfied.
     - The graph is partitioned into 1 clique: `[1, 1]`.

   - For `n = 5` and `k = 4`:
     - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`.
     - `arr = [3, 1, 5, 2, 4]` and `cliquess = [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.
     - The edge condition is satisfied within each segment:
       - Segment 1: \( |1 - 2| + |3 - 1| = 3 \le 4 \), \( |1 - 3| + |3 - 5| = 5 \not\le 4 \), \( |2 - 3| + |1 - 5| = 5 \not\le 4 \).
       - Segment 2: \( |4 - 5| + |2 - 4| = 3 \le 4 \).
     - The graph is partitioned into 2 cliques: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 2]`.

   - For `n = 8` and `k = 16`:
     - `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`.
     - `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]` and `cliquess = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
     - The edge condition is satisfied for all pairs of vertices.
     - The graph is partitioned into 1 clique: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly assigns distinct integers to the vertices, ensures the edge condition is met within each segment, and partitions the graph into the minimum number of cliques. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
