Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Function Definitions and Calls:**
   - The function `make_array` is defined but not called correctly. The function call inside `func_1` should be `make_array(left, right, clique)` but it is not defined in the global scope. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

2. **Logic for Assigning Values:**
   - The logic for assigning values to `arr` and `cliquess` in `make_array` is incorrect. The function is supposed to assign values to the vertices and determine the cliques, but the way it is implemented does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The `make_array` function is supposed to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays, but the current implementation does not handle the edge cases and the correct partitioning logic.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is not correct. The program should print the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values of `cliquess` for each test case. However, the current implementation prints the values of `arr` and `cliquess` in a way that does not match the expected output format.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should work as intended:

```python
from math import ceil

def solve(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n

    for i in range(n):
        arr[i] = (i + 1) % k + 1
        cliquess[i] = (i // k) + 1

    print(*arr)
    print(cliques)
    print(*cliquess)

# Reading input
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().strip().split())
    solve(n, k)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Clique Calculation:**
  - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`.
- **Assigning Values:**
  - The values for `arr` are assigned in a way that ensures the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met.
  - The values for `cliquess` are assigned to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
- **Output:**
  - The program prints the values of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the values of `cliquess` for each test case in the correct format.

This corrected program should pass the given test cases and produce the correct output.
