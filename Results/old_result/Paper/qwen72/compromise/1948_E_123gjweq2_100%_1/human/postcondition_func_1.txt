The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`. `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. The function updates two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, in place. After the function concludes, the elements of `arr` from index `left` to `right` are set such that the first half of the range (from `left` to `left + mid - 1`) contains values from `left + 1` to `left + mid`, and the second half (from `left + mid` to `right`) contains values from `right + 1 - not_mid` to `right + 1`. The elements of `cliquess` from index `left` to `right` are all set to the value of `clique`. The function does not return any value.
