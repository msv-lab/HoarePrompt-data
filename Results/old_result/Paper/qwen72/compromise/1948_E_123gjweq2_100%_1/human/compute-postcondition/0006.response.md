To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `not_mid`. The loop will execute if `not_mid` is greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts, the values of `left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged, and the arrays `arr` and `cliquess` have been updated as specified. However, these updates do not directly affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `not_mid` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`left`, `right`, `clique`, `small_element`, and `big_element` remain unchanged, `arr` and `cliquess` have been updated as specified, `i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0**
