To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `i` and the list `data`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in data:`.
   - The variables involved are `i` and `data`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to execute, `data` must be a non-empty list. If `data` is empty, the loop will not run even once.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - The state of `data` must be adjusted to ensure it is non-empty.
   - The variable `i` will be set to the first element of `data` when the loop starts.

4. **Other Variables:**
   - The other variables (`times`, `n`, `dic`, `ans`, `check`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

### Final Adjusted State:
- `data` must be a non-empty list.
- `i` will be the first element of `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `times` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `data` is a list of integers derived from the input.
- `dic` is an empty dictionary.
- `ans` is equal to `n`.
- `check` is 2147483647.

The adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `data` is a list of integers derived from the input and must have at least one element, `dic` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `check` is 2147483647, `i` is the first element of `data`**.
