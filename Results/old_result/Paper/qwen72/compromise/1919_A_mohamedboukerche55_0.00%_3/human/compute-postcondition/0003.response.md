Postcondition: **The loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the integer input initially provided. For each iteration, the input string `s` was split into two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively. After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case. The variable `i` will be equal to `t - 1`. Additionally, the sum of `a` and `b` is even.**
