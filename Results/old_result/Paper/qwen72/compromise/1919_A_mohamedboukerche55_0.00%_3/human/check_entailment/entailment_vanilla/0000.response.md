### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because the wallet is empty) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially reduces to a parity problem. The total number of coins (a + b) determines the outcome.
   - If the total number of coins is even, the game will end in a way where both players will have an equal number of moves, and the player who starts (Alice) will lose.
   - If the total number of coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) will have one more move than the other player (Bob), and thus Alice will win.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It then checks if the sum of the coins is even or odd.
   - If the sum is even, it prints "bob".
   - If the sum is odd, it prints "alice".

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the output for each test case. It only prints the result for the last test case because the `if` statement is outside the loop.
   - The output format is incorrect. It should print "Alice" or "Bob" without extra spaces.

5. **Corrected Program**:
   - The `if` statement should be inside the loop to handle each test case individually.
   - The output should be formatted correctly to match the problem's requirements.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(s.split()[0])
        b = int(s.split()[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.
- The corrected program correctly handles each test case and prints the results in the required format.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
