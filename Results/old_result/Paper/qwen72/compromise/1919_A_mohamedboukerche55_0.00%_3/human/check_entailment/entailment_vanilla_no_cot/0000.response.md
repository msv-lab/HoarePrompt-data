Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even or odd, and then prints the winner based on that. However, the game's outcome is not determined solely by the parity of the sum of the coins. The game's outcome depends on the specific number of coins each player has and the optimal strategy they use during the game.

### Correct Approach:
The correct approach to determine the winner is to consider the following:

1. **If both wallets have the same number of coins (a == b):**
   - The game will end in a draw if both wallets have 1 coin, but since the problem states that the player who cannot make a valid move loses, and both players will be unable to make a move at the same time, the game is essentially a draw. However, since the problem specifies that the player who cannot make a move loses, and both players will be unable to make a move at the same time, the game is a draw. But in the context of the problem, if both players have the same number of coins, the player who makes the last move (i.e., the player with the even number of moves) will lose. Therefore, if both have the same number of coins, the player who starts (Alice) will lose if the total number of coins is even, and Bob will lose if the total number of coins is odd.

2. **If the wallets have a different number of coins (a != b):**
   - The player with more coins can always force the game to end in a win by ensuring that they always have a coin to remove and can swap wallets to avoid losing. Therefore, the player with more coins will always win.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
                print('Bob')
            else:
                print('Alice')
        else:
            if a > b:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Bob')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
- **If `a == b`:** The game is determined by the parity of the sum of coins. If the sum is even, Bob wins; if the sum is odd, Alice wins.
- **If `a != b`:** The player with more coins will always win because they can force the game to end in their favor.

This corrected program will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
