Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the maximum number of points a player can score in a card game where each player takes turns to place a card on the table, and a player scores a point if the card they place matches a card already on the table. Nene, the opponent, plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score.

The function `func_1` counts how many unique card values the player has that appear exactly twice in their hand. This is because, for each card value that appears twice in the player's hand, the player can score one point by placing the second card after the first one. Nene will always place her cards in a way to maximize her score, and if she has a card that matches one of the player's cards, she will place it immediately after the player to score a point.

However, the program does not account for the optimal play by Nene. Specifically, if the player has a card value that appears only once, Nene will place her matching card immediately to score a point. The player should try to avoid giving Nene easy points by placing cards that Nene can immediately match. The current implementation only counts the number of pairs the player has, which is not sufficient to determine the maximum score the player can achieve considering Nene's optimal play.

To correctly solve the problem, the player should:
1. Count how many card values appear exactly once and exactly twice in their hand.
2. The player can score a point for each card value that appears twice, but they should also consider the strategy to avoid giving Nene easy points.

The current implementation does not consider the strategic aspect of the game, which is crucial for determining the maximum score the player can achieve.
