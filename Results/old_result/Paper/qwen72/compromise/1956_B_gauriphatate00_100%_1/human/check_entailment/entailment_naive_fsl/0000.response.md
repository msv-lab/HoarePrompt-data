Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal play strategy for both you and Nene. Specifically, the function `func_1` only counts the number of pairs of cards you have, but it does not consider the optimal play strategy where Nene will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Here is a potential case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Actual Output:
```
2
```

In this case, the program incorrectly returns 2 because it simply counts the number of pairs you have (1, 1) and (2, 2), but it does not consider that Nene will play optimally to prevent you from scoring more points. The correct output should be 1, as shown in the problem description.
