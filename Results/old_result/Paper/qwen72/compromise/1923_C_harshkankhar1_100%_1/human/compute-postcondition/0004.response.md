Output State: **`a` remains the same list of integers as in the initial state. `t` remains the same integer representing the number of test cases. `n` and `q` remain the same integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries. `c` remains the same list of integers. `queries` remains the same list of `q` pairs of integers. `b` is now a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Specifically, if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 1`, otherwise `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 2`.**
