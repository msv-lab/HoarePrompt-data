You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is greater than 0 (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of `q` pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) where 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `a` remains the same list of integers as in the initial state. `t` remains the same integer representing the number of test cases. `n` and `q` remain the same integers representing the length of the array `c` and the number of queries. `c` remains the same list of integers. `queries` remains the same list of `q` pairs of integers. `b` is now a list of integers where each element `b[i]` is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. Specifically, if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 1`, otherwise `b[i] = b[i - 1] + 2`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The values of `a`, `t`, `n`, `c`, `queries`, and `b` remain unchanged. The loop prints 'NO' or 'YES' for each query based on the condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `q`.
   - It then reads the array `c` and processes it.

2. **Array `b` Construction:**
   - The array `b` is constructed such that for each element `a[i]` in the array `a`, if `a[i] > 1`, then `b[i]` is incremented by 1; otherwise, it is incremented by 2.
   - This is done to ensure that `b[i]` is always different from `a[i]` and `b[i] > 0`.

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program uses the `accumulate` function from the `itertools` module to create a prefix sum array `a` for the input array `c`.
   - It also creates a prefix sum array `b` for the constructed array `b`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `x` and `y` and checks two conditions:
     - If the sum of the subarray `c[x]` to `c[y]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`, it prints "NO".
     - If `x == y`, it prints "NO" because a single element subarray cannot be good (it cannot be different from itself).
   - If neither of these conditions is met, it prints "YES".

### Analysis:
- **Condition 1:** The sum of the subarray `c[x]` to `c[y]` should be equal to the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. This is checked by comparing `a[y] - a[x - 1]` with `b[y] - b[x - 1]`.
- **Condition 2:** Each element in the subarray `c[x]` to `c[y]` should be different from the corresponding element in `b`. This is ensured by the construction of `b` where each element is either 1 or 2, which is always different from `c[i]` (since `c[i] > 0` and `c[i]` can be any positive integer).
- **Condition 3:** Each element in `b` should be greater than 0. This is also ensured by the construction of `b` where each element is either 1 or 2.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Element Subarray:** If `x == y`, the subarray has only one element, and it cannot be different from itself, so the program correctly prints "NO".
- **Subarray Sum Comparison:** The program correctly checks if the sum of the subarray in `c` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. If it is, the subarray cannot be good, so the program prints "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
