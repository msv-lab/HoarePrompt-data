Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking for a specific condition in the list of best friends. However, this condition, `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Explanation of the Problem:
1. **Input:** The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case has:
   - An integer `n` representing the number of friends.
   - A list `l` of integers where `l[i]` represents the best friend of the `i`-th friend.

2. **Output:** The output should be the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, we need to identify the smallest set of friends such that each friend in the set has their best friend also in the set. This can be achieved by:
- Identifying pairs of friends who are best friends with each other.
- If there are no such pairs, we need to identify the smallest cycle or chain of friends where each friend's best friend is in the set.

### Issues with the Given Program:
1. **Condition Check:** The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` is checking if the best friend of the `i`-th friend is the `i`-th friend itself, which is not possible according to the problem constraints (`p_i â‰  i`).
2. **Logic Flaw:** The program prints `2` if it finds any such pair, but it does not correctly handle cases where there are no such pairs and the minimum number of invitations required is 3.
3. **Test Case Handling:** The program does not correctly handle the test cases. It should process each test case independently and print the result for each one.

### Correct Solution:
A correct solution would involve:
- Reading the number of test cases.
- For each test case, reading the number of friends and the list of best friends.
- Identifying pairs of friends who are best friends with each other.
- If no such pairs exist, identifying the smallest cycle or chain of friends.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        visited = [False] * n
        min_invitations = n  # Start with the worst case: invite all friends

        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                # Start a new chain
                chain_length = 0
                current = i
                while not visited[current]:
                    visited[current] = True
                    current = l[current] - 1
                    chain_length += 1
                min_invitations = min(min_invitations, chain_length)

        # If the smallest chain length is 2, we can invite just 2 friends
        if min_invitations == 2:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(3)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It prints `2` based on an incorrect condition and does not handle the cases where the minimum number of invitations required is 3.

Correctness: **False**
