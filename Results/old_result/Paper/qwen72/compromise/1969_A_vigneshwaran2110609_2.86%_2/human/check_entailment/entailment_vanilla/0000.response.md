### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Monocarp has `n` friends, and each friend has a best friend.
   - A friend will come to the party only if both the friend and their best friend receive an invitation.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of invitations to send so that at least 2 friends come to the party.

2. **Input/Output Format**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has two lines: the number of friends `n` and a list `p` of length `n` where `p[i]` is the best friend of friend `i`.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list `l` of best friends.
   - It then iterates through the list `l` to check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (i.e., `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`).
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends and prints `2` in such cases.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where there is no such pair. It always prints `3` in this case, which is not always the correct answer.

5. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     2 1 4 3
     ```
   - The program will print `3`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here, friends 1 and 2 are best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are best friends. Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 3, and both pairs will come to the party.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly. Specifically, it fails to find the minimum number of invitations required when there are no direct pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.

### Correctness:
**False**
