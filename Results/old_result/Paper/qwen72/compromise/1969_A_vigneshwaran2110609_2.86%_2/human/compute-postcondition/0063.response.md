Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then checks if there is any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`. If this condition is met for any index, the function prints `2` and moves on to the next test case. If the condition is never met for any index in the list, the function prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. **
