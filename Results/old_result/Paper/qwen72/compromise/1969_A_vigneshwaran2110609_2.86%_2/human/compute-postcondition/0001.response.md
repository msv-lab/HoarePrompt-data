The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` must be initialized to 0. Given the initial state, `n` is already an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `i` is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function, so no adjustment is needed for `i`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where 1 <= p_i <= n, p_i â‰  i, and all p_i are distinct. `i` is 0.**
