Based on the precondition, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, and the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number. The code snippet contains a `print` statement that outputs the string 'Yes'.

Since the precondition specifies that `n - m` is a non-negative even number, the `print` statement will always execute and print 'Yes' because the condition is already met.

Output: **Yes**
