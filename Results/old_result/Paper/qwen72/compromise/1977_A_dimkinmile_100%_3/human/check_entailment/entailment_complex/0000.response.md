Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The key insight is that each move can either add or remove one cube, so the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves must be such that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. This is because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out, and the only way to end up with exactly `m` cubes is if the remaining moves are all adds (if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference is even).

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `kreker` from the input.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It checks if the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number.
   - If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.
   - This condition is correct because:
     - `n - m >= 0` ensures that `n` is at least as large as `m`, which is necessary to have enough moves to build the tower.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference is even, which is necessary because each pair of moves (add and remove) cancels out, and the remaining moves must all be adds.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the condition check.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 100\) and \(1 \le n, m \le 100\) correctly.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases as required.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
