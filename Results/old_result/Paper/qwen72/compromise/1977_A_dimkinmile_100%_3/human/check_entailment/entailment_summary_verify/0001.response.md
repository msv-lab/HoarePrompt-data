### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining Correctness**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the net effect of an even number of moves must be even.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves is at least as large as the number of cubes needed to build the tower. This is necessary because Nikita cannot end up with more cubes than the number of moves he has made.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis:
- The logic is correct because:
  - If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it means that Nikita can perform a sequence of moves (adding and removing cubes) such that the final number of cubes in the tower is exactly `m`.
  - If `n - m` is odd or negative, it is impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves.

### Function Summary Verification:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1()`. It correctly states that the function reads `n` and `m` from the input, checks the conditions, and prints the appropriate result.
- The function does not return any value, which is consistent with the problem requirements since the output is directly printed.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
