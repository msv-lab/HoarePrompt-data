Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. However, the function `func_1` is called without passing any arguments, which is incorrect. The function should be defined to take `n` and `m` as parameters.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to read `n` and `m` from the input inside the function, which is a better approach than passing them as arguments. However, the function should be called without arguments in the loop.

3. **Logic for Determining the Result**:
   - The condition `((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0)` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is non-negative and even.
   - If `n - m` is non-negative and even, it means that after `n` moves, Nikita can end up with exactly `m` cubes in the tower. This is because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the total number of moves must be enough to reach `m` cubes, and the number of moves to add or remove must be balanced to keep the total number of cubes even.
   - If `n - m` is negative or odd, it means that it is not possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

4. **Output**: The program correctly prints "Yes" or "No" based on the condition. The output format is also correct as it matches the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct but has a minor issue with the function call. However, since the function reads the input inside itself, the program will still work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
