You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), and a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each iteration, the variable `cost` is calculated and printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The list `M` is sorted and potentially modified by the `pop` operation, but its state is reset in each iteration. The variables `L`, `N`, `q`, `w`, and `mu` are local to the loop and do not persist between iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases defined by the integer `t`. For each test case, it takes an integer `n`, an integer `m`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements of `a`. The exact nature of the result is not specified, but it is dependent on the constraints and relationships between these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
