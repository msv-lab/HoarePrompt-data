You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Example

    4 2 3
    
    8 6 4 2
    
    4 2 8

    10000 1 100 10 1000
    
    6 3 9
    
    5 5 5 5 5 5

Output

    10
    64
    1
    72
    
Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each iteration, the variable `cost` is calculated and printed. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The list `M` is sorted and potentially modified by the `pop` operation, but its state is reset in each iteration. The variables `L`, `N`, `q`, `w`, and `mu` are local to the loop and do not persist between iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads two lines of input: the first line contains three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the second line contains a list of `n` integers `M`. The function calculates a cost based on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and the elements of `M`. The cost is determined by sorting the list `M`, selecting a subset of its elements, and performing arithmetic operations. The calculated cost is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` (if present) remain unchanged. The list `M` is sorted and potentially modified by the `pop` operation, but its state is reset in each iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought (k) is less than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought in a single day (m). In such a case, the program should simply buy all the tickets on the cheapest day, but it does not handle this edge case correctly.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```
The expected output should be `1` because you can buy 1 ticket on the second day, which is the cheapest. However, the program will output `10001` because it incorrectly calculates the cost by considering the increase in price for subsequent days, even though only one ticket is needed.

This shows that the program does not handle the case where `k < m` correctly, leading to incorrect results.
