Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order with at least 1 element. If `fav` is not equal to `l[0]`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[0]]`. If `fav` is equal to `l[0]`, and `k` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `k` is greater than or equal to 0, we also break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
