Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is the length of `l`.
   - `k` is the third integer in `b`.
   - `t` is greater than the length of `l`.
   - `b` is a list of integers derived from the substrings of `a` separated by whitespace.
   - `o` is a list of strings derived from the input split by whitespace.
   - `n` is the first integer in `b`.
   - `f` is the second integer in `b`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The values of `i`, `k`, `t`, `b`, `o`, `n`, and `f` are not directly used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always be the same.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print` statement will output the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
