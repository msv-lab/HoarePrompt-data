Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `i` is 2, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting `a` and converting each element to an integer, `o` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input and sorted in descending order, `n` is equal to the first integer in the list `b`, `f` is equal to the second integer in the list `b`, `k` is equal to the third integer in the list `b` minus the count of the string at index `i` in the list `l` minus the count of the string at index `i` in the list `l` from the dictionary `dic` minus the count of the string at index `i` in the list `l` from the dictionary `dic`, `fav` is the string at index `f - 1` in the sorted list `o`, `dic` is a dictionary where each key is a string from `o` and each value is the count of that string in `o`, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 3 elements. If `k` <= 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
