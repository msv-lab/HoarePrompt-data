Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements. `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]`. If `fav` is not equal to `l[i]` and `k` is less than or equal to 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `fav` is equal to `l[i]`, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement regardless of the value of `k`.***
