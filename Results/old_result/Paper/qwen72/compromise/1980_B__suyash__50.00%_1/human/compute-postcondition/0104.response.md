Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `i` is 1.
   - `l` is a list of unique strings from `o` sorted in descending order and must have at least 2 elements.
   - `k` is decreased by the value of `dic[l[1]]`.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('YES')
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print` statement is simply printing the string `'YES'`.
   - The initial state provides information about the variables `i`, `l`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will output the string `'YES'` regardless of the values of `i`, `l`, and `k`.

Output: **YES**
