Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it takes three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. It then calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list, plus the number of gaps of size 1 between the last element and `n`. The function prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the state of the program includes the original values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the processed results have been printed to the standard output. **
