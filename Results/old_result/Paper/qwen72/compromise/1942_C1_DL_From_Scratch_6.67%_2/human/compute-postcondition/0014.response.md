Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer where 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an input integer where 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an input integer, the second line consists of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `_` is 1, `T` must be greater than 0, `list0` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `num` is `list0[2] - list0[1] - 1`. If `num` is 1, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
