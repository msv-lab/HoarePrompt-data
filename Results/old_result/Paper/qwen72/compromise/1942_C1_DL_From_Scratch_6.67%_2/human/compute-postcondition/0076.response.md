The function `func` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer where 4 <= n <= 10^9.
- `x` is an integer where 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5).
- `y` is an integer and y = 0.
- The function also implicitly accepts a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters and the list of integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
