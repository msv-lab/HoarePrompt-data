You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple of three digits (a, b, c) such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9, and the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `q` times, and for each iteration, it will have read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it will have printed either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be in their final state after the last iteration, but their specific values will depend on the last input provided. The variable `i` will have the value `q-1` after the loop finishes. The number of test cases `t` and the input integer `q` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `q` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. Depending on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, it prints 'STAIR' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' otherwise. After executing `q` times, the function completes without returning any value. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be in their final state after the last iteration, but their specific values will depend on the last input provided. The variable `i` will have the value `q-1` after the loop finishes. The input integer `q` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether three digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by checking the conditions specified in the problem description. The conditions `a < b < c` for a stair and `a < b > c` for a peak are correctly implemented, and the program outputs "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" as required. I cannot find any edge cases or inputs where the program would fail to produce the correct output. Therefore, the program is correct.
