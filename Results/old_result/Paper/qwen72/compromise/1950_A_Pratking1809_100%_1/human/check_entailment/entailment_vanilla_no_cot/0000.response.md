Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on the conditions specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Condition Checking**:
   - It checks if the digits form a stair using the condition `a < b < c`.
   - It checks if the digits form a peak using the condition `a < b > c`.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, it prints "NONE".

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints "STAIR" if the digits form a stair.
   - It prints "PEAK" if the digits form a peak.
   - It prints "NONE" otherwise.

The program handles all the test cases correctly as per the problem description and the example provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
