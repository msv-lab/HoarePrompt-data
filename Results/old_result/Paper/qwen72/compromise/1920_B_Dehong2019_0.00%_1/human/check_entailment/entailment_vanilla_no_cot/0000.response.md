Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the game as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice's Removals:**
   - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. However, the program sorts the array in descending order, which means Alice is effectively removing the largest elements. This is the opposite of what Alice should do.
   - The program should sort the array in ascending order to allow Alice to remove the smallest elements.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Bob's Multiplications:**
   - Bob should multiply the smallest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum. However, the program is not correctly identifying the smallest elements after Alice's removals.
   - The program should consider the smallest elements in the array after Alice's removals to determine which elements Bob will multiply by -1.

3. **Logic for Combining Alice's and Bob's Actions:**
   - The program does not correctly combine the effects of Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications. It should first remove the smallest elements and then apply the multiplications to the smallest remaining elements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        a.sort()
        a = a[k:]
        
        # Bob multiplies the smallest x elements by -1
        a.sort()
        for i in range(x):
            if a[i] > 0:
                break
            a[i] = -a[i]
        
        # Calculate the sum of the array after the game
        ans = sum(a)
        print(ans)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Alice's Removals:**
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.
   - The smallest `k` elements are removed using slicing (`a = a[k:]`).

2. **Bob's Multiplications:**
   - The array is sorted again to ensure the smallest elements are at the beginning.
   - The smallest `x` elements are multiplied by -1. If an element is already positive, the loop breaks early to avoid unnecessary operations.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum of the remaining elements is calculated and printed.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
