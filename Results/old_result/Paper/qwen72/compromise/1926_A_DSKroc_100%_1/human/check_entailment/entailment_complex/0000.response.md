Reasoning:  
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case individually by counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, and then outputs the character that appears more frequently. The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description, including the length of the string and the range of the number of test cases. The logic for comparing the counts of 'A' and 'B' and printing the result is also correct.

Correctness: **True**
