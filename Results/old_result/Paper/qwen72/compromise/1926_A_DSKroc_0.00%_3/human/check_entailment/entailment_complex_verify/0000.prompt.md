You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) representing the number of test cases, and each of the following t lines contains a string of length 5 consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. All t strings are distinct.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        
        bc = 0
        
        s = input()
        
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        
    #State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `s` is the last input string, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in the last input string, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in the last input string.
    if (ac > bc) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        print('B')
        #This is printed: B
    #State: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `q` is `t-1`, `s` is the last input string, `ac` is the number of 'A' characters in `s`, and `bc` is the number of non-'A' characters in `s`. If `ac` > `bc`, the number of 'A' characters in `s` is greater than the number of non-'A' characters. Otherwise, `ac` is less than or equal to `bc`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. After processing all the strings, the function prints 'A' if the number of 'A' characters in the last string is greater than the number of 'B' characters, and prints 'B' otherwise. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the output for each test case correctly. According to the problem description, the program should output the most frequent character for each test case. However, the current implementation only prints the result for the last test case. The `if ac > bc:` and `else:` blocks should be indented to be inside the for loop that iterates over the test cases, so that the result is printed for each test case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```

This corrected version ensures that the output is printed for each test case, as required by the problem description.
