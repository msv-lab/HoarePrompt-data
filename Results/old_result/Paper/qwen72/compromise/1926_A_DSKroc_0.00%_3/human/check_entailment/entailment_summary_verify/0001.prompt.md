You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
    if ac > bc:
        print('A')
    else:
        print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each consisting of letters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. After processing all the strings, the function prints 'A' if the number of 'A' characters in the last string is greater than the number of 'B' characters, and prints 'B' otherwise. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Counting Characters:**
   - For each test case, the program initializes two counters `ac` and `bc` to zero.
   - It reads a string `s` of length 5.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `s` and increments `ac` if the character is 'A', otherwise it increments `bc`.

3. **Output Determination:**
   - After counting the characters for a test case, the program checks if `ac` is greater than `bc`.
   - If `ac` is greater, it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

4. **Scope of the Output:**
   - The `if` statement that determines the output is outside the loop that processes each test case. This means that the program will only print the result for the last test case, not for each test case individually.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only prints the result for the last test case, instead of printing the result for each test case as required by the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
