Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and prints a sequence of integers representing the number of balanced pairs of '<' and '>' that can be formed by considering each position in the string. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the results directly to the console. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the lists `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` contain intermediate values used for the computation, but they are not accessible to the user. The final state of the program is that the sequence of integers has been printed, and the function has completed its execution. **
