The only variables in the loop head are `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `j` is also relevant, as it starts at 0 for the first iteration.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `j` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`A` is a list containing the cumulative counts of '>' characters from the start of the string `s` up to each position where a '>' character is found, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list, `idx_B` is an empty list, `j` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
