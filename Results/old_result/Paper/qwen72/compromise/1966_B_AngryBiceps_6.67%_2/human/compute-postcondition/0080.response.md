Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 0; `a` is a list containing `n` user input strings; `first_row` is a string consisting of the first characters of each string in `a`; `last_row` is a string consisting of the last characters of each string in `a`; `i` is `n-1`. If the length of the set of characters in the first string of `a` is 1 and the first string of `a` is not equal to the last string of `a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, either the length of the set of characters in `first_row` is not 1, or `first_row` is equal to `last_row`.***
