Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 2; `a` is a list containing three user input strings; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the first character of the string in `a[1]` and the first character of the string in `a[2]`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the last character of the string in `a[1]` and the last character of the string in `a[2]`; `i` is 2.**

Explanation:
- The code `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last string in the list `a` to the variable `last_row`.
- The initial value of `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the last character of the string in `a[1]`.
- After executing the code, `last_row` now includes the last character of the string in `a[2]` as well.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `first_row`, and `i` remain unchanged.
