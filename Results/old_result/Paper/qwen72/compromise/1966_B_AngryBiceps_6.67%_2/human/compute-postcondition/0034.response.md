Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with one more element, which is the user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of the user input.**

Explanation:
- The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `a` is a list with one more element, which is the user input.
- The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the variable `first_row`.
- Since `a[-1]` refers to the last element of the list `a`, and `a[-1][0]` refers to the first character of that element, `first_row` is updated to include this character.
- The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
- Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `first_row` and the unchanged values of `n` and `i`.
