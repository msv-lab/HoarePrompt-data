The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list with one more element, which is the user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of the user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of the user input.**
