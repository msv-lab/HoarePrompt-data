Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list with one more element, which is the user input, `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of the user input, `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of the user input.**

The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` updates the `last_row` variable by appending the last character of the last element in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
