Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer input by the user, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `a` is a list containing `n` user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together, `last_row` is the last character of each of the `n` user inputs concatenated together. If the length of the set of the first element in `a` is 1 and the first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`, the condition is met. Otherwise, the condition is not met.**
