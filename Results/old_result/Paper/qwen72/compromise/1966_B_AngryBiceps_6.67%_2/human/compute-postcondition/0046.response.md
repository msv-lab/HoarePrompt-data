Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- `a` is a list with `n` elements, each element being a user input.
- `first_row` is the original value of `first_row` plus the first character of each user input.
- `last_row` is the original value of `last_row` plus the last character of each user input.
- The first element of `a` consists of a single unique character.
- The first element of `a` is not equal to the last element of `a`.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print('NO')
```

This statement does not depend on any of the variables or objects described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
