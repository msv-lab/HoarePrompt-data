Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 2; `a` is a list containing three user input strings; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the first character of the string in `a[1]`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the last character of the string in `a[1]`; `i` is 2.** 

The code snippet `a.append(input())` adds a third user input string to the list `a`, which initially contained two user input strings. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
