The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 2, and `n` must still be greater than `i` (i.e., `n` must be greater than 2).

State: **`n` and `m` are integers input by the user, and `n` must be greater than 2; `a` is a list containing two user input strings; `first_row` is the first character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the first character of the string in `a[1]`; `last_row` is the last character of the string in `a[0]` concatenated with the last character of the string in `a[1]`; `i` is 2**
