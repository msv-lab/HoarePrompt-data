Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing one user input, `first_row` is the first character of the user input, `last_row` is the last character of the user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `last_row += a[-1][-1]` appends the last character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `last_row`. Since `a` contains one user input, `a[-1]` refers to that input, and `a[-1][-1]` refers to the last character of that input. Therefore, `last_row` is now the last character of the user input. The other variables remain unchanged.
