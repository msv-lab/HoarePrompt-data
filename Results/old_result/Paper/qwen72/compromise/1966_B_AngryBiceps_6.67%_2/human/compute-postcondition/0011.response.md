Output State: **`n` is an integer input by the user and must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 0, `a` is a list containing two user inputs, `first_row` is the first character of the first user input concatenated with the first character of the second user input, `last_row` is the last character of the first user input.**

Explanation: The code snippet `first_row += a[-1][0]` appends the first character of the last element in the list `a` to the string `first_row`. Since `a` contains two user inputs, `a[-1]` refers to the second user input, and `a[-1][0]` is the first character of that second input. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `_`, and `last_row`) remain unchanged.
