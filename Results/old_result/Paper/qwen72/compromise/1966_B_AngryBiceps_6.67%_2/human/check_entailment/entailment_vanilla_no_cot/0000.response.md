Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the dimensions and initial colors of the grid for each test case.

2. **Grid Representation**: The grid is represented as a list of strings, where each string corresponds to a row in the grid.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the first row and the last row are not the same color, it's impossible to make the entire grid one color, so the program prints "NO".
   - If the first column and the last column are not the same color, it's also impossible to make the entire grid one color, so the program prints "NO".

4. **General Case**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES". This is because if the first and last rows or columns are the same color, it is possible to perform operations to make the entire grid one color.

5. **Optimization**: The program efficiently checks the conditions by using sets to determine if all characters in a row or column are the same.

The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements, and the program should correctly determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color for each test case.
