Reasoning:

The program aims to determine if it's possible to make all squares in an `n Ã— m` grid the same color using the specified operations. The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares in the subrectangle between them to that color. The program checks two specific conditions to decide if the grid can be made uniform:

1. **First Row and Last Row Check**: If the first row of the grid is composed of a single unique character (i.e., all 'W' or all 'B') and is not equal to the last row, the program prints 'NO'. This is because if the first row is uniform but different from the last row, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform with the given operations.

2. **First Column and Last Column Check**: If the first column of the grid is composed of a single unique character (i.e., all 'W' or all 'B') and is not equal to the last column, the program prints 'NO'. This is because if the first column is uniform but different from the last column, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform with the given operations.

If neither of these conditions is met, the program prints 'YES'. This is based on the assumption that if the first and last rows or columns are not both uniform and different, it is possible to make the entire grid uniform.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program's approach. The conditions checked are not sufficient to determine if the grid can be made uniform. Specifically:

- **First Row and Last Row Check**: This check is too restrictive. It only considers the first and last rows, but it doesn't account for the possibility that the first and last rows might be uniform but different from each other, while the rest of the grid can still be made uniform. For example, a grid where the first and last rows are 'W' and the rest of the grid is 'B' can be made uniform.

- **First Column and Last Column Check**: Similarly, this check is too restrictive. It only considers the first and last columns, but it doesn't account for the possibility that the first and last columns might be uniform but different from each other, while the rest of the grid can still be made uniform. For example, a grid where the first and last columns are 'W' and the rest of the grid is 'B' can be made uniform.

To correctly determine if the grid can be made uniform, we need to check if there is at least one 'W' and one 'B' in the grid. If the grid contains both 'W' and 'B', it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because there will always be a subrectangle that cannot be colored to a single color without violating the operation rules. If the grid contains only one color, it is already uniform, and the answer is 'YES'.

Given this reasoning, the provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle all possible scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
