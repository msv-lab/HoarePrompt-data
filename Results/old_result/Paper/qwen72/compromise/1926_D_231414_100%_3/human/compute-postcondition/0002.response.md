The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `times`. For the loop to execute, `times` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder that will be assigned values from 0 to `times - 1` during the loop execution. The state of `check` and the input reading details do not affect the loop head directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
