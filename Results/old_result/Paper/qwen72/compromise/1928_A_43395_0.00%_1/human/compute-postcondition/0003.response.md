Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function then prints 'yes' or 'no' for each test case based on the following conditions: if both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'; if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not modify the values of `a` and `b` after processing each test case. **
