Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Even Dimensions:**
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. For example, a 4x4 rectangle can be cut into two 4x2 rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a 2x8 rectangle. However, the program would output "yes" for this case, which is correct, but it would also output "yes" for a 2x2 rectangle, which is incorrect because a 2x2 rectangle can only be cut into 1x2 rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Differences:**
   - The conditions `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` and `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` are not logically sound. These conditions are not necessary for determining if Bob can form another rectangle and can lead to incorrect outputs.

3. **Simplified Correct Logic:**
   - The correct logic is simpler: Bob can form another rectangle if and only if at least one of the dimensions (a or b) is even. This is because if one dimension is even, it can be cut into two equal parts, and these parts can be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

### Test Cases:
- For the input `1 1`, the output should be "No" because both dimensions are odd, and no other rectangle can be formed.
- For the input `2 1`, the output should be "No" because one dimension is even, but the other is odd, and the only possible cut results in two 1x1 rectangles.
- For the input `2 6`, the output should be "Yes" because one dimension is even, and it can be cut into two 2x3 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x3 rectangle.
- For the input `3 2`, the output should be "Yes" because one dimension is even, and it can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x6 rectangle.
- For the input `2 2`, the output should be "Yes" because both dimensions are even, and it can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 1x4 rectangle.
- For the input `2 4`, the output should be "Yes" because one dimension is even, and it can be cut into two 2x2 rectangles, which can be rearranged to form a 4x2 rectangle.
- For the input `6 3`, the output should be "No" because one dimension is even, but the other is odd, and the only possible cut results in two 3x3 rectangles, which cannot form a different rectangle.

The provided program does not handle these cases correctly, hence it is incorrect.
