Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty for all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

Actual Output:
```
4
```

The program incorrectly increments the penalty `c` for every element that is greater than both `a` and `b`, which does not align with the problem's requirement to minimize the penalty by splitting the array into two subsequences such that the penalty is the sum of the penalties of these subsequences. The correct approach should involve a more sophisticated method to determine the optimal split, rather than simply comparing each element to `a` and `b` and incrementing `c` based on these comparisons.
