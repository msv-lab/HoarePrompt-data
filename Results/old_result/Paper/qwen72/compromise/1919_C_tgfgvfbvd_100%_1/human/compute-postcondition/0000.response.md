To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head. The loop head contains only the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.
2. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. This means the input must be a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- The function should accept two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the array `a` of size `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) with elements `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input is at least 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the input is a positive integer (1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ t)**
