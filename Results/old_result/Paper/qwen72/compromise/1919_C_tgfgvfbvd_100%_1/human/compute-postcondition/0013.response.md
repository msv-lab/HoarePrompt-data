Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is infinity, `b` is `l[x]`, `c` is 0. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to `b`. Otherwise, `a` remains infinity, and `c` remains 0. Additionally, `l[x]` is greater than `a`, and the current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b`.**

In natural language: The variable `b` is updated to the value of `l[x]`, which is a specific integer from the list `l`. The variable `a` remains infinity, and `c` remains 0. The conditions that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and `t` and must be greater than 0, and `l` is a list of integers input by the user, are still valid. The condition that `l[x]` is greater than `a` is no longer valid because `a` is still infinity, and the condition that `l[x]` is less than or equal to `b` is now valid because `b` is set to `l[x]`.
