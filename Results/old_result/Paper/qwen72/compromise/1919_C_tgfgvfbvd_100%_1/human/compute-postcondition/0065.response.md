Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 1, and `c` is 0 if `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, otherwise `c` is 1. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. If `l[1]` is less than or equal to `b`, `b` remains unchanged. If `l[1]` is greater than `b`, `a` is now equal to `l[1]`.***
