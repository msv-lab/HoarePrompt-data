Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is `n - 1`, `a` is `float('inf')`, `b` is `float('inf')`, and `c` is 0.**

Explanation: The code snippet `c = 0` sets the variable `c` to 0. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `x`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects this change while maintaining the initial conditions of the other variables.
