Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 0, and `l[0]` is greater than `a`. If `l[0]` is less than or equal to `b`, then `b` is updated to `l[0]` and `c` remains 0. Otherwise, `a` is updated to `l[0]`, `b` remains `float('inf')`, and `c` is set to 1.***
