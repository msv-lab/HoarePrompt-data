Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t) and must be greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is `l[x]`, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is set to `b`. Otherwise, `a` and `b` remain infinity, and `c` remains 0. The current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is updated to `l[x]`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `l`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.
- The condition that `a` > `b` will not be true because `b` is infinity, so `a` remains `l[x]`.
- The condition that the current value of `l[x]` is less than or equal to `a` is still valid after the update.
