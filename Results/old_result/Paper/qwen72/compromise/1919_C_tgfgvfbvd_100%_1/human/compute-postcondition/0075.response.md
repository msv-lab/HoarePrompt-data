Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `x` is 2, `c` is 0. If `l[2]` ≤ `a`, then `a` is equal to `l[2]`. If `a` > `b`, then `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. If `l[2]` > `b`, then `c` is 1, `a` is equal to `l[2]`, and if `a` > `b`, then `a` is now equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` is now equal to the original value of `a`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.***
