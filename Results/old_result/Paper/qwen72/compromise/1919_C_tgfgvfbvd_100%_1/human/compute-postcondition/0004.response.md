Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ t), `l` is a list of integers input by the user, `a` is infinity, `b` is infinity, `c` is 0.** 

The variable `c` is initialized to 0, while the other variables (`t`, `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
