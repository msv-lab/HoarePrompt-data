### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).
   - We can perform an operation where we choose a subarray `a[l:r]` and set all elements in this subarray to the MEX of the subarray.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array `a` using no more than 5 * 10^5 operations.

2. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.
   - For a subarray `a[l:r]`, the MEX will be the smallest integer from 0 to `r - l + 1` that is not in the subarray.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to handle the case where `l == r` and also to recursively set the subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX value.
     - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself for the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to the length of the subarray `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation to `ops`.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function checks if the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If true, it calls `func_1(a, l, r, ops)` to set the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
     - If false, it finds the maximum value in the subarray, its position, and recursively calls itself for the subarrays to the left and right of the maximum value.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2(a)` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results in the required format.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and sets the element to 0 if it is not already 0.
   - The recursive function `func_1` correctly sets the subarray to the MEX value and appends the operation to `ops`.
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` correctly splits the array based on the maximum value and recursively maximizes the sum for the subarrays.
   - The function `func_3` correctly reads the input, processes it, and prints the output in the required format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle arrays of length 1 correctly, as shown in the example where `a = [0]` and the output is `1 1 1 1`.
   - The program should handle arrays where the MEX is 0 correctly, as shown in the example where `a = [0, 1]` and the output is `4 1 1 2`.
   - The program should handle arrays where the MEX is greater than 0 correctly, as shown in the example where `a = [1, 3, 9]` and the output is `13 0`.

6. **Complexity**:
   - The program uses recursion and splits the array based on the maximum value, which ensures that the number of operations does not exceed the limit of 5 * 10^5.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles the base cases, recursive splits, and edge cases appropriately, and it ensures that the number of operations is within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
