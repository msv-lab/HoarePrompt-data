Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to perform the operation on a sublist of the array `a` from index `l` to `r`.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If so, it appends the operation `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets `a[l]` to 0. This is correct because the MEX of a single-element set is 0 if the element is not 0.
   - If `l` is not equal to `r`, it recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r`, then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1` (the length of the sublist). If so, it appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops` and sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1`. This is correct because the MEX of a set of integers from 0 to `r - l` is `r - l + 1`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function initializes the list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` with the entire array.
   - It then returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - However, there is a mistake in the function. It calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` but does not pass the necessary arguments (`a` and `ops`). This will result in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

3. **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
   - This function is designed to maximize the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`.
   - It calculates the sum `s` of the sublist and compares it to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`. If `s` is less than or equal to this value, it calls `func_1` to perform the operation and set all elements in the sublist to `r - l + 1`.
   - If `s` is greater, it finds the maximum value `mx` in the sublist and its position `pos`. It then recursively calls itself on the left and right segments of the array, excluding the maximum value.
   - The logic here is correct, but it relies on the correct passing of `a` and `ops` from `func_2`.

4. **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations, and prints the results.
   - The function correctly reads `n` and `a` from standard input and prints the results in the required format.

**Conclusion**:
- The program has a logical error in `func_2` where it does not pass the necessary arguments (`a` and `ops`) to `recursive_maximize_sum`.
- This error will cause the program to fail with a `NameError` when `recursive_maximize_sum` is called.

Correctness: **False**
