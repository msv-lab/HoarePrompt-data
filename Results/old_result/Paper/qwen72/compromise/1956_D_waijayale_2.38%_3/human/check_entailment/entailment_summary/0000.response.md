**Reasoning:**

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function is designed to perform the operation on a sublist of the array `a` from index `l` to `r`.
   - If `l` equals `r` and `a[l]` is not 0, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends the operation `(l, l)` to `ops`.
   - If `l` is not equal to `r` and `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`, it sets all elements from index `l` to `r` in `a` to `r - l + 1` and appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with `l + 1` and `r` to continue processing the sublist.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function initializes the list `ops` to store the operations.
   - It calls the `recursive_maximize_sum` function with the entire array `a` (from index 0 to `n-1`).
   - After the recursive function has processed the array, it returns the sum of the elements in `a`, the number of operations performed, and the list of operations.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum` Analysis:**
   - This function is called by `func_2` and is responsible for maximizing the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r+1]`.
   - It calculates the sum of the elements in the sublist and compares it to the square of the length of the sublist.
   - If the sum is less than or equal to the square of the length, it calls `func_1` to perform the operation on the entire sublist and sets all elements to `r - l + 1`.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the sublist and recursively processes the left and right sublists around this maximum element.
   - The function appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops` when the sublist is modified.

4. **Function `func_3` Analysis:**
   - This function reads the input, which includes the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum `s`, the number of operations `m`, and the list of operations `ops`.
   - It prints the maximum sum `s` and the number of operations `m`.
   - It then prints each operation in `ops` with indices adjusted by 1 to match the 1-based indexing required by the problem.

**Issues Identified:**
- **Function `func_2`** incorrectly returns the maximum element `m` instead of the number of operations performed. The correct return should be `(sum(a), len(ops), ops)`.

**Conclusion:**
- The provided functions are almost correct, but there is a mistake in `func_2` where it returns the maximum element instead of the number of operations. This would cause the output to be incorrect.

**Correctness:**
- **False**

The program is incorrect because `func_2` returns the wrong value for the number of operations performed. This would lead to incorrect output in the final step where the number of operations is printed.
