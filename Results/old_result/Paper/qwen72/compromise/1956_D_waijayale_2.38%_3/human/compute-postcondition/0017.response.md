Functionality: ** The function `recursive_maximize_sum` accepts two integers `l` and `r` and a list of integers `a`. It modifies the sublist `a[l:r+1]` by setting all elements to the value `r - l + 1` if the sum of the elements in this sublist is less than or equal to the square of the sublist's length. Otherwise, it recursively processes the left and right sublists around the maximum element in the sublist. The function also appends tuples `(l, r)` to the list `ops` when the sublist is modified. The final state of the program is that the list `a` may have been modified, and `ops` contains tuples representing the ranges of sublists that were modified. The function itself does not return a value. **
