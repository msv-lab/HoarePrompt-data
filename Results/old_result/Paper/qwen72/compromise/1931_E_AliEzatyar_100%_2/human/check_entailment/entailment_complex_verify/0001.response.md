### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `n_test`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the parameter `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers `array` and splits it into individual elements.

2. **Digit Counting and Trailing Zeros:**
   - The program calculates the total number of digits in the list `total_digits`.
   - It also counts the number of trailing zeros in each number using `func_1` and stores these counts in the list `zeros`.

3. **Optimal Play Strategy:**
   - The program sorts the `zeros` list in descending order.
   - It then calculates the total number of digits that can be removed by Anna by summing every second element in the `zeros` list. This is incorrect because Anna can reverse any number of elements, and the number of trailing zeros removed should be the sum of all trailing zeros, not just every second element.
   - The correct approach should be to sum all elements in the `zeros` list to get the total number of trailing zeros that can be removed by Anna.

4. **Winning Condition:**
   - The program checks if `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`. This is incorrect because the game ends when Sasha can't make a move, and the winning condition should be based on the final number of digits, not the absolute difference.
   - The correct condition should be to check if the total number of digits after removing trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m`.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a given number represented as a string.

### Evaluation of Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `num` is a string representation of an integer where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 9 (since each integer in the list satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
  - The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in the string `num`.

- **State of the program after the function call:**
  - The function returns the count of trailing zeros in the string `num`.
  - This count is stored in the list `zeros` if it is greater than 0.

- **State of the program after the loop:**
  - `total_digits` is the sum of the lengths of all strings in `array`.
  - `zeros` is a list of the counts of trailing zeros for each number in `array`.

- **State of the program after sorting `zeros`:**
  - `zeros` is sorted in descending order.

- **State of the program after the second loop:**
  - `subtract_zero` is the sum of every second element in the `zeros` list, which is incorrect.

- **State of the program after the winning condition check:**
  - The program checks if `abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies the issues with the program:
- The calculation of `subtract_zero` is incorrect. It should be the sum of all trailing zeros, not just every second element.
- The winning condition check is incorrect. It should check if the total number of digits after removing trailing zeros is greater than or equal to `m`, not `m + 1`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
