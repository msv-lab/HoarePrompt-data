### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - **Anna's Move:** Anna reverses the digits of a chosen integer from the list. This does not change the total number of digits in the list.
   - **Sasha's Move:** Sasha concatenates two integers from the list, reducing the number of elements by one but increasing the total number of digits.
   - **Winning Condition:** Sasha wins if the final concatenated number has at least \(10^m\) digits. Otherwise, Anna wins.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - **Digit Counting:** The program counts the total number of digits in the list and identifies the number of trailing zeros in each integer.
   - **Trailing Zeros Handling:** The function `func_1` is supposed to count the trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer, but the program incorrectly treats `num` as a list of integers instead of a single integer string.
   - **Optimal Play Strategy:**
     - Anna's optimal strategy is to reverse the digits of the smallest number to minimize the impact on the total digit count.
     - Sasha's optimal strategy is to concatenate the two largest numbers to maximize the total digit count.
   - **Winning Condition Check:** The program checks if the total number of digits minus the sum of trailing zeros (in pairs) is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). This is a heuristic approach but may not always be correct.

3. **Function `func_1` Issue:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to count trailing zeros in a single integer string, but it is being called with a list of integers, which is incorrect.
   - The function should be called with each integer string from the list, not the entire list.

4. **Correct Function Call:**
   - The function `func_1` should be called with each integer string from the list `array` to count trailing zeros for each integer.
   - The corrected function call should be `func_1(item)` where `item` is a string representation of each integer.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of subtracting the sum of trailing zeros (in pairs) from the total digit count is a heuristic but may not always be correct. For example, if the list contains many small numbers with trailing zeros, this approach might not accurately predict the final concatenated number's length.
   - However, the heuristic is a reasonable approximation for the problem, and it seems to work for the given test cases.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the function call and the heuristic approach, the program is not entirely correct. The function `func_1` should be called with each integer string, and the logic for determining the winner should be more robust to handle edge cases.

**Correctness: False**
