Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, and `len(num)` must be greater than or equal to 3. If `num[i]` is '0', `counter` is 3 if the second last element of `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 1. If `num[i]` is not '0', `counter` is 2 if the second last element of `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
