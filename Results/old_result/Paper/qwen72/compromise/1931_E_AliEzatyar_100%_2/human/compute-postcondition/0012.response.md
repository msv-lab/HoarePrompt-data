Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, `i` is `len(num) - 3`, `counter` is 3 if the second last element of `num` is '0', otherwise `counter` is 1, and `len(num)` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

The value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. If the second last element of `num` was '0', `counter` is now 3. Otherwise, `counter` is now 1. The values of `num` and `i` remain unchanged. The length of `num` is still greater than or equal to 3.
