Output State: **`num` is a list of integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `counter` is the number of trailing zeros in the list `num`.**

### Explanation:
- The loop iterates backward through the list `num` starting from the last element.
- For each element, if it is '0', the `counter` is incremented by 1.
- If a non-zero element is encountered, the loop breaks immediately.
- Therefore, after all iterations, `counter` will hold the count of consecutive zeros at the end of the list `num`. If there are no trailing zeros, `counter` will remain 0.
