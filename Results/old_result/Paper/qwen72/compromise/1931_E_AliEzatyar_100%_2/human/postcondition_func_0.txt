The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the number of trailing zeros in the list. The list `num` must contain integers where 1 ≤ len(num) ≤ 2 · 10^5, and each integer in `num` must satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. After the function concludes, the state of the program is unchanged except for the return value, which is the count of trailing zeros in the list `num`.
