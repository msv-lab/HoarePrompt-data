To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop head:

```python
while s.find('map') != -1:
```

This loop will execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in the string `s`. The condition `s.find('map') != -1` checks if 'map' is present in `s`.

### Initial State:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
- The length of `s` is an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^6.
- `s` is not equal to 'mapie'.
- `ans` is 0.

### Analysis:
- The variable `s` is the only one involved in the loop head.
- For the loop to execute, `s` must contain the substring 'map'.
- The current state does not guarantee that `s` contains 'map'. Specifically, `s` is not equal to 'mapie', but it could be any other string that does not contain 'map'.

### Adjustment:
- To ensure the loop executes at least once, `s` must be modified to contain the substring 'map'.

### Final State:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'map'.
- The length of `s` is an integer `n` such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^6.
- `ans` is 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and contains the substring 'map', `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^6, `ans` is 0**
