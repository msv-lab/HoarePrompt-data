### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Over Test Cases:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Element:**
   - The variable `maxi` is initialized to 0.
   - The first loop iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` and compares the bitwise OR of `p[maxi]` with itself to the bitwise OR of `p[i]` with itself using the query `"? maxi maxi i i"`.
   - If the result of the query is `<`, it means `p[i]` is greater than `p[maxi]` in terms of bitwise OR, and `maxi` is updated to `i`.
   - This loop ensures that `maxi` is the index of the element in the permutation that has the highest value when ORed with itself.

3. **Finding Elements with the Same Maximum OR Value:**
   - The list `arr` is initialized with the index `0`.
   - The second loop iterates over all indices `i` from 1 to `n-1` and compares the bitwise OR of `p[maxi]` with `p[arr[0]]` to the bitwise OR of `p[maxi]` with `p[i]` using the query `"? maxi arr[0] maxi i"`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p[i]` has a higher OR value with `p[maxi]` than `p[arr[0]]`, and `arr` is updated to contain only `i`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `p[i]` has the same OR value with `p[maxi]` as `p[arr[0]]`, and `i` is appended to `arr`.
   - This loop ensures that `arr` contains all indices `i` such that `p[maxi] | p[i]` is maximized.

4. **Finding the Minimum Element in `arr`:**
   - The variable `mini` is initialized to the first element in `arr`.
   - The third loop iterates over all elements in `arr` starting from the second element and compares the bitwise OR of `p[mini]` with itself to the bitwise OR of `p[item]` with itself using the query `"? mini mini item item"`.
   - If the result is `>`, it means `p[item]` is less than `p[mini]` in terms of bitwise OR, and `mini` is updated to `item`.
   - This loop ensures that `mini` is the index of the element in `arr` that has the smallest value when ORed with itself.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - Finally, the function outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` using the query `"? maxi mini"` and prints the result in the format `! maxi mini`.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Finding the Maximum Element:**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index `maxi` of the element in the permutation that has the highest value when ORed with itself. This is because the OR operation with the same element will always yield the element itself, and the loop ensures that `maxi` is the maximum.

- **Finding Elements with the Same Maximum OR Value:**
  - The second loop correctly identifies all indices `i` such that `p[maxi] | p[i]` is maximized. This is because the OR operation with `p[maxi]` will yield the same value for all elements in `arr`.

- **Finding the Minimum Element in `arr`:**
  - The third loop correctly identifies the index `mini` of the element in `arr` that has the smallest value when ORed with itself. This is because the OR operation with the same element will always yield the element itself, and the loop ensures that `mini` is the minimum.

- **Output the Result:**
  - The final output `! maxi mini` is correct because `maxi` and `mini` are the indices of the elements in the permutation that, when XORed, yield the maximum possible value. This is because the XOR operation between the maximum element and the minimum element (in terms of OR) will likely yield the highest possible XOR value.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically sound and follows the problem requirements. It correctly identifies the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized using at most 3n queries.

**Correctness: True**
