Postcondition: ***`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<' and must have at least 2 elements, `mini` is 0, `item` is `arr[1]`, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`, `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is updated to `arr[1]`.***
