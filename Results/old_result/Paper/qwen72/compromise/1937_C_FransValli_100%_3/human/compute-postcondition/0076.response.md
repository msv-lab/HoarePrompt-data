Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0 and `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. `res` is an input string.**

Explanation:
- The code `res = input()` assigns the value of the user input to the variable `res`.
- The input is a string, so `res` is now a string.
- The values of `n`, `i`, `arr`, `maxi`, and `mini` remain unchanged from the initial state.
- The conditions for `maxi` and `mini` based on the value of `res` remain the same as in the initial state.
