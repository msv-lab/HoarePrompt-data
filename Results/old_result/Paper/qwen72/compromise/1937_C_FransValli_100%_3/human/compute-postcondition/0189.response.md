Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'.
   - `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<'. The list `arr` must have at least 3 elements.
   - `mini` is 0.
   - `item` is `arr[2]`.
   - `_` is the number of iterations, which is `n-1`.
   - `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is updated to `arr[1]`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `mini` is 0 unless `res` is '>', in which case `mini` is updated to `arr[1]`.
   - `item` is `arr[2]`, which is the third element of the list `arr`.

4. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `res` is not '>', then `mini` remains 0.
   - If `res` is '>', then `mini` is updated to `arr[1]`.

5. **Output Calculation:**
   - If `res` is not '>', the output will be:
     ```
     '?', 0, 0, arr[2], arr[2]
     ```
   - If `res` is '>', the output will be:
     ```
     '?', arr[1], arr[1], arr[2], arr[2]
     ```

6. **Final Output:**
   - Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both scenarios.
   - If `res` is not '>', the output is:
     Output: **? 0 0 [arr[2]] [arr[2]] (where arr[2] is the third element of the list arr)**
   - If `res` is '>', the output is:
     Output: **? [arr[1]] [arr[1]] [arr[2]] [arr[2]] (where arr[1] is the second element of the list arr and arr[2] is the third element of the list arr)**

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to provide a general answer that covers both cases:

Output: **? [mini] [mini] [arr[2]] [arr[2]] (where mini is 0 if res is not '>', or arr[1] if res is '>', and arr[2] is the third element of the list arr)**
