Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is [1, 2] if `res` is '<', otherwise `arr` is [0, 1, 2]. If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `maxi` is 0. If `res` is not '=' or '<', then `arr` remains [0, 2] and `maxi` remains 0.** 

The value of `i` (which is 2) is appended to the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` depends on the value of `res`. If `res` is '<', `arr` starts as [1] and becomes [1, 2] after the code execution. If `res` is not '<' but is not '=', `arr` starts as [0, 1] and becomes [0, 1, 2]. If `res` is '=', `arr` also starts as [0, 1] and becomes [0, 1, 2]. If `res` is neither '<' nor '=', `arr` starts as [0] and becomes [0, 2]. The values of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged.
