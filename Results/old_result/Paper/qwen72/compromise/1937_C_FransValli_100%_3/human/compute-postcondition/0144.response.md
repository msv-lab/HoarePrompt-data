To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to focus on the variables that are part of the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order
- `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`)
- `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`
- `res` is the input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.
- `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
- `n` must remain greater than `i` for the loop to continue, so `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables (`arr`, `item`, `_`, `res`, `maxi`, `mini`) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0. `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'**
