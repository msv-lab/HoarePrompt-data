The value of `res` is updated to the new input string, and the previous state of `n`, `i`, and `maxi` remains unchanged. If the new input string is '<', then `maxi` will be set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` will remain 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `maxi` is 0 if `res` is not '<', otherwise `maxi` is 1, and `res` is the new input string.**
