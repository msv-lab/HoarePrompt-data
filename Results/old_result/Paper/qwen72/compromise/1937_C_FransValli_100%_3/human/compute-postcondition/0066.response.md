Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**

Explanation:
- The value of `n` is updated to a new input integer greater than 0.
- The value of `i` is still `n-1` because `i` is derived from the new value of `n`.
- The values of `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the new input to `n`.
