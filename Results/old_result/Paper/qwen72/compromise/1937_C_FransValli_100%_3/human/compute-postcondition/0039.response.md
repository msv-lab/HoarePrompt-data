Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 0 and must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `maxi` is 0.
   - The value of `res` determines the state of `arr`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2].
     - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [0, 1, 2] and `maxi` is 0.
     - If `res` is not '<' or '=', then `arr` is [0, 1] if `res` is not '=', otherwise `arr` remains [0] and `maxi` remains 0.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```
   print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - `maxi` is always 0, regardless of the value of `res`.
   - `i` is always 3, regardless of the value of `res`.
   - `arr[0]` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `arr` is [2], so `arr[0]` is 2.
     - If `res` is '=', then `arr` is [0, 1, 2], so `arr[0]` is 0.
     - If `res` is not '<' or '=', then `arr` is [0, 1] or [0], so `arr[0]` is 0.

4. **Possible Outputs:**
   - If `res` is '<':
     - `arr` is [2], so `arr[0]` is 2.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 2 0 3`.
   - If `res` is '=':
     - `arr` is [0, 1, 2], so `arr[0]` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 0 3`.
   - If `res` is not '<' or '=':
     - `arr` is [0, 1] or [0], so `arr[0]` is 0.
     - The print statement will output: `? 0 0 0 3`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider all possible cases. However, the most precise description based on the given conditions is:

Output: **? 0 [arr[0]] 0 3 (where [arr[0]] is 2 if `res` is '<', and 0 otherwise)**
