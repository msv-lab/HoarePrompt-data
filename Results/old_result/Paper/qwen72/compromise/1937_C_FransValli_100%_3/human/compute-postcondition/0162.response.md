To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the code step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.
- `res` is an input string.
  - If `res` is '<', `arr` is [1].
  - If `res` is '=', `arr` is [1].
  - Otherwise, `arr` is not modified.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`res` and `arr`**:
   - If `res` is '<' or '=', then `arr` is [1].
   - If `res` is anything else, `arr` is not modified. Since the initial state does not specify the initial value of `arr`, we assume it is not modified and remains undefined or empty.

2. **`maxi`**:
   - The variable `maxi` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, it is undefined, and the code will raise a `NameError` when trying to access `maxi`.

3. **`arr[0]`**:
   - If `arr` is [1] (because `res` is '<' or '='), then `arr[0]` is 1.
   - If `arr` is not modified, then `arr[0]` will raise an `IndexError` because `arr` is either undefined or empty.

4. **`i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly given as 2.

### Conclusion:
Given that `maxi` is undefined, the code will raise a `NameError` before it can print anything. Therefore, the output will be an error message.

Output: **NameError: name 'maxi' is not defined**
