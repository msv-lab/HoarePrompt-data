The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `n` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0. `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>'**
