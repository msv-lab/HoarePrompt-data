Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the first element of `arr`.
Code of the loop:
for item in arr[1:]:
    print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
    res = input()
    if res == '>':
        mini = item


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing at least two elements, `mini` is the first element of `arr`, `item` is the second element of `arr`, and `res` is an input string. If `res` is '>', then `mini` is updated to the second element of `arr` and `item` remains the second element of `arr`. If `res` is not '>', the variables retain their initial values.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing at least three elements, `mini` is the third element of `arr`, `item` is the third element of `arr`, and `res` is the new input string. If `res` is '>', the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which the input `res` was '<' during the loop execution, or 0 if no such `i` exists, `arr` is a list containing at least four elements, `mini` is the fourth element of `arr` if `res` is not '>', otherwise `mini` is the third element of `arr`, `item` is the fourth element of `arr`, and `res` is the new input string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
