Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
```

### Analysis:
1. **`'?'`**: This is a string literal and will be printed as is.
2. **`maxi`**: The variable `maxi` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, its value is unknown.
3. **`arr[0]`**: The variable `arr` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the value of `arr[0]` is unknown.
4. **`maxi`**: This is the same as the second `maxi` in the print statement, and its value is still unknown.
5. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.

### Output:
The print statement will output a string that starts with `?`, followed by the value of `maxi`, the value of `arr[0]`, the value of `maxi` again, and the value of `i` which is 1. Since `maxi` and `arr[0]` are not defined in the initial state, their values are unknown.

Output: **? [maxi] [arr[0]] [maxi] 1 (where [maxi] is the value of the undefined variable `maxi` and [arr[0]] is the value of the undefined list `arr` at index 0)**
