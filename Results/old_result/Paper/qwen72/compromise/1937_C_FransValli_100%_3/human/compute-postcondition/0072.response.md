Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is 1, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists, `res` is '<'.**

Explanation: The code snippet `maxi = i` updates the value of `maxi` to be equal to the current value of `i`, which is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state reflects this change in `maxi`.
