Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string, if `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2, otherwise `maxi` remains 0, `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `maxi = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 2) to `maxi`.
- If `res` is '<', `maxi` was previously 1, but now it is updated to 2.
- If `res` is not '<', `maxi` was previously 0, and now it is updated to 2.
- `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>', as specified in the initial state.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `item`, `_`, `res`) remain unchanged.
