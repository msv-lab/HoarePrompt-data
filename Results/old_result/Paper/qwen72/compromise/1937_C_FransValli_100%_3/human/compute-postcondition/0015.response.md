Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `res` is a new input string.
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2.
   - Otherwise, `maxi` is 0.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
   ```

3. **Determine the Values:**
   - The value of `i` is explicitly given as 3.
   - The value of `maxi` depends on the value of `res`:
     - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 2.
     - If `res` is anything other than '<', then `maxi` is 0.

4. **Output Calculation:**
   - The `print` statement will always start with the string `'?'`.
   - It will then print the value of `maxi` twice.
   - It will then print the value of `i` twice.
   - The `flush=True` argument ensures that the output is immediately written to the terminal, but it does not affect the content of the output.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `res` is '<', the output will be: `? 2 2 3 3`.
   - If `res` is anything other than '<', the output will be: `? 0 0 3 3`.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases:

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 3 3 (where [maxi] is 2 if res is '<', otherwise [maxi] is 0)**
