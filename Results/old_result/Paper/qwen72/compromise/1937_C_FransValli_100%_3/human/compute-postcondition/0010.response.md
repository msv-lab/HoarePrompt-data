Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `res` is an input string.
- If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is set to 1. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the value of `maxi`**:
   - If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is set to 1.
   - If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` remains 0.

2. **Determine the value of `i`**:
   - `i` is explicitly set to 2.

3. **Construct the output**:
   - The `print` statement will output the following:
     - The string `'?'`
     - The value of `maxi` (which is either 0 or 1)
     - The value of `maxi` again (which is the same as the previous value)
     - The value of `i` (which is 2)
     - The value of `i` again (which is 2)

### Final Output:
- If `res` is '<', then `maxi` is 1.
- If `res` is not '<', then `maxi` is 0.

Therefore, the output will be:
- If `res` is '<':
  Output: **? 1 1 2 2**
- If `res` is not '<':
  Output: **? 0 0 2 2**

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided, we need to consider both cases. However, the format of the output remains consistent.

Output: **? [maxi] [maxi] 2 2 (where maxi is 0 if res is not '<' and 1 if res is '<')**
