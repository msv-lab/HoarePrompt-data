Output State: **`n` is the input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `arr` is a list containing all values of `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last value of `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>', `item` is 0, `_` is the number of iterations which is `n-1`.**

In natural language, after the loop has executed all its iterations:
- The value of `n` remains the same as the input integer.
- The value of `i` is `n-1`, which is the last value of `i` in the loop.
- `maxi` is the last value of `i` for which the response `res` was '<'.
- `arr` is a list that contains all values of `i` for which the response `res` was '='. If `res` was '<' at any point, the last such value of `i` is also in `arr`.
- `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which the response `res` was '>', or it remains 0 if `res` was never '>'.
- `item` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `_` is the number of iterations, which is `n-1`, since the loop runs from `1` to `n-1`.
