Output State: **The loop has completed its execution for all test cases. For each test case, `maxi` is the index of the element in the permutation `p` that, when XORed with the element at `mini`, gives the maximum possible value. `arr` contains the indices of elements that have the same maximum bitwise OR value with `maxi`. `mini` is the index of the element in `arr` that, when XORed with the element at `maxi`, gives the maximum possible value. `_` is the number of test cases, and `n` is the input integer for the last test case.**

In simpler terms, after the loop executes all iterations, the following is true for each test case:
- `maxi` holds the index of an element in the permutation `p` that, when XORed with the element at `mini`, gives the maximum possible XOR value.
- `arr` is a list of indices that have the same maximum bitwise OR value with `maxi`.
- `mini` is the index within `arr` that, when XORed with the element at `maxi`, gives the maximum possible XOR value.
- `_` is the total number of test cases that were processed.
- `n` is the value of the last input integer `n` that was processed.
