You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is part of an interactive problem where the input is a sequence of test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). The hidden permutation p is a list of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can ask up to 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" to compare bitwise OR results, and must eventually output a pair of indices "! i j" such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: The loop has completed its execution for all test cases. For each test case, `maxi` is the index of the element in the permutation `p` that, when XORed with the element at `mini`, gives the maximum possible value. `arr` contains the indices of elements that have the same maximum bitwise OR value with `maxi`. `mini` is the index of the element in `arr` that, when XORed with the element at `maxi`, gives the maximum possible value. `_` is the number of test cases, and `n` is the input integer for the last test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an environment with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1 for each test case, where `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). It can ask up to 3n queries to compare bitwise OR results of elements in `p`. The function returns a pair of indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
