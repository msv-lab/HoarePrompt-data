Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

### Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `maxi` is 0.
- `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<'.
- `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.

### Print Statement:
```
print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`maxi`**: According to the initial state, `maxi` is 0.
2. **`i`**: According to the initial state, `i` is 1.
3. **`flush=True`**: This is an argument in the `print` function that ensures the output is immediately flushed to the console, but it does not affect the content of what is printed.

### What is Printed:
- The first element in the print statement is the string `'?'`.
- The second and third elements are both `maxi`, which is 0.
- The fourth and fifth elements are both `i`, which is 1.

### Final Output:
Output: **? 0 0 1 1**
