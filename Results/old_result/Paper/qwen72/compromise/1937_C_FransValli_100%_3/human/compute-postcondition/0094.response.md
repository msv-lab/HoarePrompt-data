Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the largest integer `i` for which `res` was '<' during the loop execution, `arr` is `[0, 1]`, `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists. If `res` is '=', then `res` is set to '='. Otherwise, `res` remains not '<'.***
