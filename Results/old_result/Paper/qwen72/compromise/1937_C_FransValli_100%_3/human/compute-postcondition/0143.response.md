Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`, `res` is the input string. If `res` is '<', `maxi` is 2. Otherwise, `maxi` remains 0. `mini` remains 0 if `res` was never '>'***.
