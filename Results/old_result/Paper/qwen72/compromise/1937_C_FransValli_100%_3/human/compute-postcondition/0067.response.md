Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing all integers `i` for which `res` was '=' or the last integer `i` for which `res` was '<', `mini` is the last element of `arr` that was compared and resulted in `res` being '>', or the first element of `arr` if no such element exists.**

The code snippet `maxi = 0` resets the value of `maxi` to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `mini`) remain unchanged, maintaining their initial states.
