Output State: **`n` is the new input integer, `i` is `n-1`, `maxi` is 0, `arr` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` in increasing order, `mini` is the largest integer from `arr` for which `res` was '>' or remains 0 if `res` was never '>', `item` is the last element in `arr` (which is `n-1`), `_` is incremented by 1 and must be less than the integer input provided by `int(input())`.**

Explanation:
- `maxi` is set to 0, overriding its previous value.
- All other variables (`n`, `i`, `arr`, `mini`, `item`, `_`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
