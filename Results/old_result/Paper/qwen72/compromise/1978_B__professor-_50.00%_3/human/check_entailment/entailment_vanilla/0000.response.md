### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit in this case is `n * a`.
     - This is correctly handled by the program.

   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence is `n * (2 * b - n + 1) / 2`.
     - This is correctly handled by the program.

   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, it is optimal to sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2`.
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is `(n - (b - a)) * a`.
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts.
     - The program calculates this as `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`, but there is a mistake here. The correct formula should be `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a)))`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.
   - The output format is correct, printing a single integer for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is almost correct, but there is a mistake in the formula for the third case. The correct formula should be `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a)))` instead of `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) / 2 + a * (n - (b - a))))
```
