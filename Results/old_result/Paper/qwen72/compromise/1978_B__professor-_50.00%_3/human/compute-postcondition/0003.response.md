The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints and relationships, it seems that the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The function should accept these parameters in some form, possibly as a list of tuples or individual arguments for each test case. Each test case is constrained such that `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`, and the total number of test cases `t` is constrained such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

Given the constraints and the expected output, the function is likely to return a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the example. Assuming the function returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`), and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.**
