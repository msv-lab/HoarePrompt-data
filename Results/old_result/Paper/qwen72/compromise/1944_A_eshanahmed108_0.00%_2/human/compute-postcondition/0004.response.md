Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple pairs of integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `n` represents the number of islands and `k` represents the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. For each pair, it prints `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise it prints `1`. The function does not return any value and does not retain the input values after each iteration. **
