The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate a certain number of times. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value provided by `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the context of the function `min_islands(n, k)` and the loop, we need to ensure that the loop will execute at least once. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that the input value must be greater than 0.

State: **`_` is a placeholder, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
