The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it seems to accept multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact output is not provided. However, given the constraints, it is likely that the function returns some computation or comparison result involving `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and for each of the `t` test cases, it accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
