The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `w`. If `n` is less than 3, the function prints 0. If `n` is 3 or greater, the function calculates and prints the number of unique combinations of three elements from the list `w` that are all the same, plus the number of unique combinations of two elements from the list `w` that are the same, multiplied by the count of the first unique element. After processing all test cases, the function terminates.
