Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `j` is 1, and `eta` contains the element 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `eta.append(j)` appends the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `eta`.
- Since `j` is 1 and `q[j]` (i.e., `q[1]`) is greater than 0, `eta` initially contains the element 0.
- After appending `j` (which is 1) to `eta`, `eta` now contains the elements [0, 1].
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `w`, `n`, `q`) remain unchanged.
