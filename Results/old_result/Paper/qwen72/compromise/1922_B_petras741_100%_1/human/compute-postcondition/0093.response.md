Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` is the input integer, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `q[k]` (for `k` in `w`) is the count of how many times `k` appears in `w`, `eta` is a list containing all the integers `k` from 0 to `n` for which `q[k]` is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `rho` is the count of how many times the first element of `eta` appears in `w`. If `eta_ln` is 1, the state remains unchanged. Otherwise, `j` is set to `eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is the sum of the counts of all elements in `eta` that appear in `w`, and `res` is the sum of the combinations of 3 elements from each `q[k]` (for `k` in `eta`) plus the sum of the combinations of 2 elements from each `q[k]` (for `k` in `eta`) multiplied by the total count of elements in `eta` that appear in `w` before the current element.**
