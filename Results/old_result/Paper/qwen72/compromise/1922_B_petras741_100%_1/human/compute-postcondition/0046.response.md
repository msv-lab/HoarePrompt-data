Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`. If `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`. Otherwise, `j` is `eta_ln - 1`, `rho` is the sum of the values of `q` at the indices `eta[0]` through `eta[eta_ln - 1]`, and `res` is the sum of the results of `q[eta[k]] * (q[eta[k]] - 1) * (q[eta[k]] - 2) // 6 + q[eta[k]] * (q[eta[k]] - 1) // 2 * (rho - q[eta[k]])` for each `k` from 1 to `eta_ln - 1`.***
