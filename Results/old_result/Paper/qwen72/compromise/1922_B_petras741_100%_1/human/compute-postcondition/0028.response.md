Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `j` is `n`, `eta` is a list containing the indices of `q` where the value is greater than 0, `eta_ln` is the length of `eta`, and `eta_ln` is 1, `rho` is the value of `q` at the index `eta[0]`.**
