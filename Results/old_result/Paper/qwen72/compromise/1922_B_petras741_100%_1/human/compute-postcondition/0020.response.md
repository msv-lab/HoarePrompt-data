Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `j` is 1, and `eta` is a list containing the element 1.**

Explanation:
- The code `eta.append(j)` adds the value of `j` (which is 1) to the list `eta`.
- Since `eta` was either an empty list or a list containing the element 0 if `q[0]` is greater than 0, after appending `j`, `eta` now contains the element 1.
- All other variables (`t`, `i`, `buffer`, `w`, `n`, `q`) remain unchanged.
