The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`. To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop variable `j` changes and the condition for the loop to continue executing.

1. **Variable `j`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. In the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2.
2. **Variable `n`:** The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n + 1` is greater than or equal to 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than 4.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` with the elements at indices `w[0]`, `w[1]`, ..., `w[n-1]` each incremented by 1, `j` is 2, and `eta` is a list containing the element 1 if `q[j]` is greater than 0, otherwise `eta` is an empty list or a list containing the element 0 if `q[0]` is greater than 0.**
