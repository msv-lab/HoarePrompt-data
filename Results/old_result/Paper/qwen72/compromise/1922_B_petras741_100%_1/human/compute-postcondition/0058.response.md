The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will be 2. For the loop to continue, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `buffer` is an empty list, `w` is a list of integers provided by the user, `n` must be greater than 2, `q` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros except `q[w[0]]` which is 1 and `q[w[1]]` which is now 1, `j` is 2**
