Reasoning:  
The program is intended to solve the problem of calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). However, there are a few issues in the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Calculation of `c`**: The variable `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of \( n \times (n - 1) \). This is incorrect because the total number of pairs of children is \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \). The correct calculation should be:
   \[
   c = \left( \frac{n \times (n - 1)}{2} \right)^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]

2. **Update of `s`**: The update of `s` in the loop is incorrect. The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each excursion should be calculated as follows:
   - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value of the friendship value for a specific pair of friends being chosen in the i-th excursion is \( \frac{f_i + i - 1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

   The correct update for `s` should be:
   \[
   s = s + \left( \frac{a + m \times (k - 1) \times k / 2}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \mod (10^9 + 7)
   \]

3. **Modular Arithmetic**: The program should ensure that all operations are performed under modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to avoid overflow and ensure correctness.

4. **Efficiency**: The current implementation has a time complexity of \( O(k \times m) \), which is inefficient given the constraints. The expected value can be calculated in \( O(m) \) for each test case.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
        c = pow(total_pairs, -1, M)
        a = 0
        for _ in range(m):
            (u, v, f) = map(int, input().split())
            a = (a + f) % M
        expected_sum = (a * k + m * k * (k - 1) // 2) % M
        print((expected_sum * c) % M)

func()
```

This corrected version:
- Calculates `c` correctly as the modular inverse of the total number of pairs.
- Computes the expected sum of friendship values in a more efficient manner.
- Uses modular arithmetic to ensure all operations are performed correctly under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Correctness: **False**
