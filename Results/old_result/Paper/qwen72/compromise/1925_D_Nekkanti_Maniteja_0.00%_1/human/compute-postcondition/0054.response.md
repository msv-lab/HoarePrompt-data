The objects in the loop head are `i` and `m`. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as this is the starting point for the loop.

State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `c`, `s`, `a`, `u`, `v`, `f` remain unchanged, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is 0, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0**
