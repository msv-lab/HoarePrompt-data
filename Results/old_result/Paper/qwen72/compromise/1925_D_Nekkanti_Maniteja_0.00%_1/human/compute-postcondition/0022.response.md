Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is `k - 1`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (0 * m + 1 * m + 2 * m + ... + (k-1) * m) + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`t`**: Remains an integer within the range 1 to 50,000.
- **`i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `k - 1`, which is the last index the loop iterated over.
- **`n`, `m`, `k`**: These values remain unchanged as they are provided by the user and are not modified within the loop.
- **`M`**: The constant `M` remains 100,000,007.
- **`c`**: The value of `c` remains the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`.
- **`s`**: The variable `s` is updated in each iteration of the loop. After `k` iterations, `s` will be the sum of the following terms:
  - `c * a` added `k` times.
  - `c * i * c * m` for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
  - This can be simplified to `s = c * a * k + c * c * m * (0 + 1 + 2 + ... + (k-1))`.
  - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers (0 to `k-1`) is given by the formula \(\frac{(k-1) * k}{2}\).
  - Therefore, the final value of `s` is `s = c * a * k + c * c * m * \(\frac{(k-1) * k}{2}\)`.
- **`a`**: The sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations remains unchanged.
- **`u`, `v`, `f`**: These variables are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, and they remain unchanged after the loop.
- **`m`**: Must be greater than or equal to 3, as specified in the initial state.
- **`k`**: Must be greater than or equal to 3, as specified in the initial state.
