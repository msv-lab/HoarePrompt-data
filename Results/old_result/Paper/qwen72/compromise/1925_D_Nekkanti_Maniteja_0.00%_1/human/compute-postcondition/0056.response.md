Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `c`, `s`, `u`, `v`, `f` remain unchanged, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is 0, `a` is `f`, `i` is 0, `m` must be greater than 0, `u` is an input integer, `v` is an input integer, `f` is an input integer.**

The value of `a` is updated to be equal to the value of `f`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
