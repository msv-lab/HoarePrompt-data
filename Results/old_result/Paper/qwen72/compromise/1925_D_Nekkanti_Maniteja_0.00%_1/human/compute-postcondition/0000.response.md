The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute based on the value of `t` (the number of test cases). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `i` is not explicitly defined, but it will be initialized by the loop.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is 0**
