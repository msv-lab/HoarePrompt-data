The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the input provided by the user, which is implicitly used to determine the range of the loop. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the input value. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and the input value must be greater than `k - 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is `k - 1`
- `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `k` must be greater than or equal to 3

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented to `k`
- The input value must be greater than `k - 1`

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, `i` is `k`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers provided by the user, `M` is 1000000007, `c` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `n * (n - 1) // 1` modulo `M`, `s` is updated to `s + c * (0 * m + 1 * m + 2 * m + ... + (k-1) * m) + c * a * k`, `a` is the sum of all `f` values provided by the user over `m` iterations, `u`, `v`, and `f` are updated with the final values provided by the user in the last iteration, `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, and the input value must be greater than `k - 1`**
