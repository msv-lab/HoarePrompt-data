The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from a single input line, and then reads a list of `n` integers `a` from another input line. The function processes each test case and prints a result based on specific conditions involving `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a`. If `k` matches certain predefined values, a specific result is printed. Otherwise, the function attempts to decrement elements from both ends of the list `a` until `k` is exhausted, and then prints the number of zeros in the list `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.
