The code snippet provided is simply `print('1')`. This statement will print the string `'1'` regardless of the initial state or any other variables and objects defined in the precondition.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:
1. The initial state mentions variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k`, but none of these variables are used in the `print` statement.
2. The `print` statement is explicitly printing the string `'1'`.

Output: **1**
