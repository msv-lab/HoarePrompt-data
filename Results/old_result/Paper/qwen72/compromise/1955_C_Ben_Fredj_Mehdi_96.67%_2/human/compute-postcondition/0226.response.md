The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
print('8')
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `z` is 2.
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
   - `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space.
   - `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The `print` statement in the code snippet is `print('8')`.
   - This statement prints the string `'8'`.

3. **Variables and Objects**:
   - The variables `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are mentioned in the initial state but are not used in the `print` statement.
   - The `print` statement only prints a constant string `'8'`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will output the string `'8'`.

Output: **8**
