Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

- **Initial State**:
  - `t` is greater than 0.
  - `z` is 2.
  - `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input.
  - `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space.
  - `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space.

- **Code Snippet**:
  ```python
  print('2')
  ```

The `print` statement in the code snippet is simply printing the string `'2'`. The values of `t`, `z`, `a`, `n`, and `k` are not used in this `print` statement, so they do not affect the output.

Output: **2**
