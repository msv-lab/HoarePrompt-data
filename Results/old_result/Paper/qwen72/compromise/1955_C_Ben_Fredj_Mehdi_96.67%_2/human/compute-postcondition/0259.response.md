Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `k // 2`, `a[d]` is now `int(a[d]) - 1`. If `a[d]` was 0, `d` is decremented by 1 and if `a[g]` is 0, `g` is incremented by 1.**
