Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `a[0]` is the first integer in `a` minus 1, and `a[d]` is the last integer in `a` minus 1. If `a[0]` is 0, `g` is updated to 1. If the last element of `a` is 0 after decrementing, `d` is updated to `len(a) - 2`. If `a[g]` is 0, `g` is 1. If `a[d]` was 0, `d` is `len(a) - 2`.***
