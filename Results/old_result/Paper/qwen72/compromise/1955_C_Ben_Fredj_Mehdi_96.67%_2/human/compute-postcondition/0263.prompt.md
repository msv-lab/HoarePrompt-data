Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` after the first space, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k // 2):
    try:
        a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1
        a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1
        if a[g] == 0:
            g += 1
        if a[d] == 0:
            d -= 1
    except:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `d` is `len(a) - 1`, `g` is 0. If the operations in the `try` block succeed, `a[0]` is the first integer in `a` minus 1, and if `a[0]` is 0, `g` is updated to 1. If the last element of `a` is 0 after decrementing, `d` is updated to `len(a) - 2`. If any exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the values of `a`, `g`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial state.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1. If the `try` block executes without exceptions, `a[0]` is the first integer in `a` minus 1, and `a[d]` is the last integer in `a` minus 1. If `a[0]` is 0 after decrementing, `g` is updated to 1. If the last element of `a` is 0 after decrementing, `d` is updated to `len(a) - 2`. If an exception occurs, the state of all variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: An exception in the `try` block could occur at `a[g] = int(a[g]) - 1` or `a[d] = int(a[d]) - 1` if `g` or `d` is out of the bounds of the list `a`, or if the elements at `a[g]` or `a[d]` cannot be converted to an integer.

The `try` block attempts to decrement the values at indices `g` and `d` in the list `a` by 1. If the value at `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1. If the value at `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Therefore, the output state is: **`t` is greater than 0, `z` is 2, `a` is a list of integers provided by the new input, `n` is the integer value of the substring of the new `a` before the first space, `k` must be at least 2, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` must be less than `k // 2`. If the operation on `a[g]` or `a[d]` is successful, `a[g]` and `a[d]` are decremented by 1. If `a[g]` becomes 0, `g` is incremented by 1, and if `a[d]` becomes 0, `d` is decremented by 1. If an exception occurs, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
