The provided code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'200'`. The initial state describes several variables and conditions, but none of these variables or conditions are used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the `print` statement will execute independently of the initial state and will simply print the string `'200'`.

Output: **200**
