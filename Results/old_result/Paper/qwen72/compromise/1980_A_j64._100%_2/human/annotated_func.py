#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1(n, m, a):
    count = [0] * 7
    for char in a:
        count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1
        
    #State: `count` is a list of 7 integers where each integer represents the frequency of the corresponding character from 'A' to 'G' in the string `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged.

        if count[i] < m:
            needed_problems += m - count[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `needed_problems` is the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The list `count` remains unchanged.
    return needed_problems
    #The program returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged. The list `count` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `a`. It returns the total number of additional problems needed to ensure that each character from 'A' to 'G' appears at least `m` times in the string `a`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the list `count` is a local variable that is not returned or modified outside the function.
