The function `sol` should be called with no arguments, but it is expected to read input from stdin in the format described in the problem statement. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer n representing the number of piles, followed by a list of n integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The number of test cases t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
