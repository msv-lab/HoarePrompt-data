The given `print` statement is:
```
print('Bob')
```

In the initial state, the variables and objects are described as follows:
- `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)
- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5)
- `piles` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)
- `N` is an input integer
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers where each element is 0
- `ls` is the sum of all elements in the original `nums` list
- `nw` is True
- `cw` is False

However, the `print` statement does not depend on any of these variables or objects. It simply prints the string 'Bob'.

Output: **Bob**
