Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to buy exactly `n` yogurts given the regular price `a` and the promotional price `b` for two yogurts. The logic in the program is as follows:

1. **Regular Price vs. Promotion Price**: The program first checks if the regular price for two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`). If it is, then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price, so the program prints `A * B`.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts `A` is even, the program calculates the total cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price (`C`), which is `A * C / 2`.

3. **Odd Number of Yogurts**: If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program buys as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buys one additional yogurt at the regular price. This is calculated as `X * C + B`, where `X` is `A // 2`.

Let's analyze the correctness of the program:

- **Case 1: `B * 2 < C`**  
  If the regular price for two yogurts is less than the promotional price, it is indeed cheaper to buy all yogurts at the regular price. The program correctly prints `A * B`.

- **Case 2: `A` is even**  
  If the number of yogurts is even, the program correctly calculates the total cost by buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The formula `A * C / 2` is correct, and the result is converted to an integer using `int()`.

- **Case 3: `A` is odd**  
  If the number of yogurts is odd, the program buys as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and then buys one additional yogurt at the regular price. The formula `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2` is correct.

However, there is a potential issue with the logic in the odd case. The program should also consider the possibility that buying all yogurts at the regular price might be cheaper than buying one at the regular price and the rest at the promotional price. This is not explicitly handled in the current logic.

To ensure correctness, we need to compare the cost of buying all yogurts at the regular price (`A * B`) with the cost of buying pairs at the promotional price and one at the regular price (`X * C + B`).

Let's correct the program to handle this:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        else:
            X = A // 2
            cost_with_promotion = X * C + (A % 2) * B
            cost_without_promotion = A * B
            print(min(cost_with_promotion, cost_without_promotion))
```

With this correction, the program will always print the minimum cost between buying all yogurts at the regular price and buying pairs at the promotional price with one at the regular price if necessary.

Given the original program, it is incorrect because it does not consider the possibility that buying all yogurts at the regular price might be cheaper in the odd case.

Correctness: **False**
