### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts on promotion is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider both the regular price and the promotion price to find the minimum cost.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` which represent `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively.
   - The program then checks if the promotion price for two yogurts (`C`) is greater than or equal to twice the regular price (`B * 2`):
     - If `B * 2 < C`, it means buying two yogurts at the regular price is cheaper than the promotion. Therefore, the minimum cost to buy `A` yogurts is `A * B`.
     - If `A % 2 == 0`, it means `A` is even. In this case, the minimum cost is `A * C / 2` because we can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price.
     - If `A % 2 != 0`, it means `A` is odd. In this case, we can buy `A // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price. The cost is `X * C + B` where `X = A // 2`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The first condition `if B * 2 < C` correctly handles the case where the regular price is cheaper than the promotion price. If the promotion is more expensive, it's better to buy all yogurts at the regular price.
   - The second condition `elif A % 2 == 0` correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts is even. If `A` is even, we can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, which is the cheapest option.
   - The third condition `else` correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts is odd. It buys `A // 2` pairs at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price, ensuring the minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `A` is 1 or 2.
     - For `A = 1`, the program will print `B` because it cannot use the promotion.
     - For `A = 2`, the program will print `C` if `C` is cheaper than `2 * B`, otherwise it will print `2 * B`.

5. **Output Verification:**
   - The program's output matches the expected results for the given example:
     - For `2 5 9`, it prints `9` because `9` is cheaper than `10` (2 * 5).
     - For `3 5 9`, it prints `14` because `14` (9 + 5) is cheaper than `15` (3 * 5).
     - For `3 5 11`, it prints `15` because `15` (3 * 5) is cheaper than `16` (11 + 5).
     - For `4 5 11`, it prints `20` because `20` (4 * 5) is cheaper than `22` (2 * 11).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given conditions. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
