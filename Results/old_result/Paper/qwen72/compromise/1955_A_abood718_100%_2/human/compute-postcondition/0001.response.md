Output State: **The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop. The loop iterates t times, and for each iteration, it reads new values for A, B, and C from the input, processes them according to the given conditions, and prints the result. After all iterations, the loop completes, and the values of t, n, a, and b are still within their initial ranges.**
