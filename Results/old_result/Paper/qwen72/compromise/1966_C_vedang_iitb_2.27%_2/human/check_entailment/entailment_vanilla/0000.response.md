### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a positive integer \( k \) of stones from each nonempty pile.
   - \( k \) must be at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first.

2. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.
   - The key to solving this problem is to determine the parity (odd or even) of the number of moves that can be made before the game ends.

3. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of pile sizes and returns a new list where each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list of pile sizes.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the pile sizes into a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The transformation is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and then computing the differences between consecutive elements.

4. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function determines the winner of the game given the transformed pile sizes and the number of piles.
   - **Base Cases:**
     - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can remove all stones in one move.
     - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on the parity of the smallest pile size. If the smallest pile size is even, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the outcome of the game if the first pile is removed.
     - If the recursive call (`func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`) indicates that the next player (Bob) will lose, Alice wins.
     - If the recursive call indicates that the next player (Bob) will win and the first pile size is not 1, Alice wins.
     - Otherwise, Bob wins.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Base Cases:**
     - When `n == 1`, Alice wins, which is correct.
     - When `n == 2`, the parity check is correct. If the smallest pile size is even, Alice can always win by removing an even number of stones, leaving Bob with an odd number of stones to remove.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - The recursive logic is correct. By removing the first pile and checking the outcome of the remaining piles, the function correctly determines the winner based on the optimal play.
     - The condition `if winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1)` ensures that Alice wins if Bob will lose in the next turn or if Bob will win but the first pile size is not 1 (Alice can still make a move that forces Bob into a losing position).

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The transformation in `func_1` simplifies the problem by reducing the pile sizes to a form that can be more easily analyzed for the game's outcome.
   - The recursive function `func_2` correctly handles the base cases and the recursive step, ensuring that the winner is determined based on optimal play.
