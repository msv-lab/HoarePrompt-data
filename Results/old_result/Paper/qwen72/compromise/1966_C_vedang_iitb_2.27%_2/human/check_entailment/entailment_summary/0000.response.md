### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** The function `func_1` processes the list of pile sizes `a` to create a new list `a_new` where each element represents the difference between consecutive unique pile sizes when sorted.
   - **Behavior:**
     - It first sorts the unique elements of `a` and stores them in `a_new`.
     - It then iterates through `a_new` and updates each element to be the difference between the current element and the previous element.
   - **Output:** The output is a list of differences between consecutive unique pile sizes, which effectively reduces the problem to a simpler form where the pile sizes are the differences.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - **Purpose:** The function `func_2` determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a_new` and the number of unique pile sizes `n`.
   - **Behavior:**
     - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can remove all stones from the single pile.
     - If `n` is 2, Alice wins if the first element of `a` is even, otherwise Bob wins. This is because if the first element is even, Alice can always choose an even `k` to leave an even number of stones for Bob, and Bob will be forced to choose an odd `k` on his turn, eventually leaving Alice with the winning move.
     - For `n` greater than 2, the function recursively checks the sub-list `a[1:]` to determine if the next player (Bob) can win. If Bob can win, Alice can choose a move that forces Bob into a losing position. If Bob cannot win, Alice will lose.
   - **Recursive Logic:**
     - The function uses a recursive approach to simulate the game for smaller sub-lists.
     - The base cases handle the scenarios where `n` is 1 or 2.
     - The recursive case checks if the next player (Bob) can win with the remaining piles. If Bob can win, Alice can choose a move that forces Bob into a losing position. If Bob cannot win, Alice will lose.

3. **Overall Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `a`.
   - It then transforms the list `a` using `func_1` to get `a_new`.
   - It uses `func_2` to determine the winner based on the transformed list `a_new` and the number of unique pile sizes `n`.
   - The program prints "Alice" if `func_2` returns 1 and "Bob" if `func_2` returns 2.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description. The transformation in `func_1` and the recursive decision-making in `func_2` are both logically sound and handle the base cases and recursive cases appropriately.

Therefore, the program is correct.
