The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one integer, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will take the value of the first element in `a` during the first iteration.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user that must have at least one integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `n` is an input integer**
