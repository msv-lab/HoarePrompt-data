Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with zeros, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a space-separated list of integers from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`.
- The variable `cntl` is not yet initialized in this snippet, so it remains as a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 (as per the initial state).
- The variable `n` is an input integer, and its value is not changed by this code snippet.
- The variables `j` and `c` are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain undefined in the output state.
