Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`, `n` is an input integer. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the count of the integer `0` in the list `a` is 0. Otherwise, `cntl[0]` is not 0, and `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus the number of integers `j` in the range 1 to `n` (inclusive) for which `cntl[j]` is less than 2.** 

The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` updates the list `a` to be a list of integers provided by the user. The other variables (`cntl`, `n`, and `c`) remain unchanged, and their initial conditions are still valid.
