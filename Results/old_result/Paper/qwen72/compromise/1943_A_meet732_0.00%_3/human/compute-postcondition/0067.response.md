Output State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1, if `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` minus 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`. `j` is `j + 1` and `n` must be greater than `j`. `c` is `c - 1`.** 

In natural language: The value of `c` is decremented by 1. All other conditions and variable values remain the same.
