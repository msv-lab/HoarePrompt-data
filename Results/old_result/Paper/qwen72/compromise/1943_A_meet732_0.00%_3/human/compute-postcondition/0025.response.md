Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
   - `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`.
   - `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
   - `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]`.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(j)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The variable `j` is explicitly defined as 2 in the initial state.
   - The `print` statement simply prints the value of `j`.

Since `j` is explicitly set to 2, the `print` statement will output the value 2.

Output: **2**
