Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        c -= 1
        if not c or j == n:
            print(j)
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `n` must be at least 0, and `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is updated to the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same values of `a`, `c`, `n`, and `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `n` must be at least 2, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `c` and `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `n` must be at least 3, and `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `cntl`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
