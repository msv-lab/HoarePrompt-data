Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` represents the count of how many times the integer `i` appeared in the list `a`, `n` must be greater than 0, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is the minimum of 1 and `cntl[0]` minus 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `j` is `k + 1` where `k` is the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration. The values of `a`, `cntl`, `n`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `c` is 0 or `j` is equal to `n`.***
