Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `n` must be at least 2, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the updated values of `c` and `j`.***
