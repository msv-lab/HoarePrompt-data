The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the list `a`. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one integer. The state of `i` will be adjusted automatically by the loop as it iterates over the elements of `a`.

Given that `a` is a list of integers provided by the user, and the loop will execute if `a` is not empty, the state needs to ensure that `a` contains at least one integer. The other variables mentioned in the state before the loop, such as `int(input())`, `_`, `n`, and `cntl`, are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`a` is a list of integers that must contain at least one integer, `i` is the first integer in the list**
