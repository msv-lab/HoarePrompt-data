Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` (where `i` is an integer in `a`) is increased by the number of times `i` appears in `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0 or `j` equals `n`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
