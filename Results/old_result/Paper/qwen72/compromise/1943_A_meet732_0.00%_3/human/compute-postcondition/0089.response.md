To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

1. **Variable `j`**: This is the loop iterator, and it will start at 1 and increment by 1 until it reaches `n + 1`. The initial state of `j` is not provided, but it will be set by the loop itself on the first iteration.

2. **Variable `n`**: This variable determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 0 (since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`).

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers provided by the user.
- `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0.
- `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. The only variable that affects the loop's execution is `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`a` is a list of integers provided by the user, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, `n` must be at least 0, `j` is 1**
