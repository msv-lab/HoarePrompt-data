### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the program and the original assessment.

#### Problem Breakdown
1. **Objective**: Find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally.
2. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to minimize the MEX.
3. **MEX Definition**: The smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

3. **Initial Check for 0**:
   - If `0` is not present in `a` (i.e., `cntl[0] == 0`), the program prints `0` and moves to the next test case.
   - This is correct because if `0` is not in `a`, the MEX of `c` will be `0` regardless of the other elements.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The program initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`. This is because Alice can pick at most 2 `0`s if they are present.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n`:
     - If `cntl[j] < 2`, it means that `j` is not present in `a` or is present fewer than 2 times.
     - The program decrements `c` and checks if `c` is `0` or if `j` is the last element (`n`).
     - If either condition is met, the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

#### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the array `a` contains no `0`s but does contain other numbers. Specifically, it mentions the input:
```
1
4
1 2 3 4
```
The expected output is `0` because the array `a` does not contain `0`, and the MEX of an array that does not contain `0` is `0`. However, the program will print `0` because it checks if `0` is not in `cntl`, which is correct.

#### Correctness Verification
1. **Case where `0` is not in `a`**:
   - The program correctly prints `0` if `0` is not in `a`.
   - This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Case where `0` is in `a`**:
   - The program initializes `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which is correct because Alice can pick at most 2 `0`s.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n` to find the first integer `j` that is not present in `a` or is present fewer than 2 times.
   - If `c` is decremented to `0` or if `j` is the last element, the program prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This logic ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated by considering the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `4\n0 0 1 1`
   - `cntl` will be `[2, 2, 0, 0]`.
   - Since `cntl[0] == 2`, `c` is initialized to `2`.
   - The program iterates through `1` to `4`:
     - `cntl[1] == 2`, so `c` remains `2`.
     - `cntl[2] == 0`, so `c` is decremented to `1` and the program prints `2`.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4\n0 1 2 3`
   - `cntl` will be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.
   - Since `cntl[0] == 1`, `c` is initialized to `1`.
   - The program iterates through `1` to `4`:
     - `cntl[1] == 1`, so `c` is decremented to `0` and the program prints `1`.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2\n1 1`
   - `cntl` will be `[0, 2]`.
   - Since `cntl[0] == 0`, the program prints `0`.

#### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the cases where `0` is not in `a` and where `0` is in `a`. It also correctly calculates the MEX by considering the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.
