### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Counting Elements**:
   - The function initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates over the list `a` and increments the count for each integer in `cntl`.

3. **Special Case for 0**:
   - If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not present in the array `a`. Since the MEX of an array that does not contain 0 is 0, the function correctly prints 0 in this case.

4. **Finding the MEX**:
   - The function initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice and Bob can each pick at most one 0, and if there are no 0s, the MEX is 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` and checks if the count of the current index `j` in `cntl` is less than 2.
   - If the count is less than 2, it decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0 or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will always try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to maximize the MEX, and Bob will try to pick the smallest integer that is not yet in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - The logic in the function correctly simulates this optimal play by ensuring that the first integer `j` with a count less than 2 is the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles the input, counts the occurrences of each integer, and determines the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
