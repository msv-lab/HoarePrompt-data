### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number `k` such that we can split the array `a` into `k` segments where the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `x`.
   - If no such `k` exists, we should return `-1`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The main loop reads the input and calls `func_1` with the array `arr` and the integer `x`.
   - `func_1` calls `find_max` with the array `arr` and the integer `31`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` simply calls `find_max` with `arr` and `31`.
   - The parameter `x` is not used within `func_1`, which is incorrect because `x` is crucial for determining the maximum `k`.

4. **Function `find_max`**:
   - The function `find_max` is designed to recursively find the maximum number of segments by checking the bits from the highest (31st) to the lowest (0th).
   - If `bit` is `-1`, it returns the length of `cur_arr`, which is incorrect because it should return the maximum `k` based on the condition involving `x`.
   - The function processes the array to create a new list `new_arr` where each element is the cumulative XOR of elements in `cur_arr` until the bit position specified by `bit` is 0.
   - If the bit at position `bit` in the cumulative XOR of `cur_arr` is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
   - If the bit at position `bit` in the cumulative XOR of `cur_arr` is 0, it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)`.
   - If the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 1, it returns the maximum value between the result of `find_max(cur_arr, bit - 1)` and the length of `new_arr`.
   - If the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0, it returns the result of `find_max(new_arr, bit - 1)` or `-1` if the bit at position `bit` in the cumulative XOR of `cur_arr` is 1.

5. **Issues**:
   - **Parameter `x` in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` should pass `x` to `find_max` instead of `31`.
   - **Base Case in `find_max`**: The base case should return the maximum `k` based on the condition involving `x`, not just the length of `cur_arr`.
   - **Cumulative XOR Check**: The function `find_max` should correctly check the cumulative XOR and ensure that the bitwise OR of the XOR results is less than or equal to `x`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not pass the correct parameters to `find_max`, and the base case in `find_max` is incorrect. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False****
