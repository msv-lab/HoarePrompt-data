You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of segments `[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], ..., [l_k, r_k]` such that:
     - `l_1 = 1`
     - `r_k = n`
     - `l_i <= r_i` for all `i` from 1 to `k`
     - `r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1}` for all `i` from 1 to `k - 1`
     - The bitwise OR of the XOR results of each segment is less than or equal to `x`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(arr, x)`**:
   - This function calls `find_max(arr, 31)`.
   - The choice of `31` as the initial bit is significant because the problem constraints mention that `0 <= x < 2^30`, so the highest bit we need to consider is the 30th bit (0-indexed).

3. **Function 2: `find_max(cur_arr, bit)`**:
   - This function is a recursive function that processes the array `cur_arr` bit by bit, starting from the highest bit (31).
   - **Base Case**:
     - If `bit == -1`, it means we have processed all bits, and the length of `cur_arr` is returned as the result.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - Initialize `new_arr` to store the XOR results of segments.
     - Initialize `xor` to 0 to keep track of the current XOR segment.
     - Initialize `thing1` to 0 to store the result of the current bit processing.
     - Iterate through each element `i` in `cur_arr`:
       - Update `xor` with the current element.
       - Check if the current bit in `xor` is 0 (`if not xor >> bit & 1`):
         - If true, append `xor` to `new_arr` and reset `xor` to 0.
     - After the loop, check if the current bit in `xor` is 1:
       - If true, set `thing1` to -1 (indicating that the current segment cannot be split further).
       - If false, recursively call `find_max` on `new_arr` with the next bit (`bit - 1`).
     - Finally, check if the current bit in `x` is 1:
       - If true, return the maximum of the recursive call on the original array with the next bit and the length of `new_arr`.
       - If false, return `thing1`.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The function `find_max` processes the array by splitting it into segments where the XOR of the segment does not set the current bit.
   - It recursively processes the array bit by bit, ensuring that the XOR results of the segments are considered in decreasing order of significance.
   - The base case correctly returns the length of the array when all bits have been processed.
   - The recursive case correctly handles the splitting of segments and the comparison with the target `x`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is 0, the function correctly handles the case where no segments can be formed if any element in the array is non-zero.
   - If `x` is a large number, the function correctly processes all bits and ensures that the maximum number of segments is found.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of each segment is less than or equal to `x`. The recursive approach ensures that the problem is solved bit by bit, and the base case and recursive calls are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
