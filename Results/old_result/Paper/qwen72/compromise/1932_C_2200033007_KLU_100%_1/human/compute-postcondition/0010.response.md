The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. 

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4.
- `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.

The function returns a reversed list of `n` positive integers. Each integer in this list is the result of the product of the elements in `a` from the current position to the end, modulo `m`.
