### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `x` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` using `func_3()`.

2. **Permutation and Index Mapping:**
   - The program creates a dictionary `num_indx` to map each number in the permutation to its index (1-based).
   - It initializes a list `seen` to keep track of which elements have been "seen" during the binary search.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - The program performs a binary search on the permutation `p` with initial bounds `left = 0` and `right = n`.
   - The loop continues until `left + 1 < right`, which ensures that the search space is reduced to a single element.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates the `seen` list to mark the element at `p[mid]` as seen.
   - If `p[mid] <= x`, it updates `left` to `mid`, otherwise it updates `right` to `mid`.

4. **Post-Search Check and Swaps:**
   - After the binary search loop, the program checks if `p[left]` is equal to `x`.
   - If `p[left] == x`, it prints `0` (no swaps needed).
   - If `x` is not in the `seen` list, it prints `1` and the indices to swap `x` into the correct position.
   - If `x` is in the `seen` list, it prints `2` and the indices to swap `x` and another element to ensure the correct position.

5. **Functionality and Correctness:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and performs the binary search on the permutation.
   - The logic for determining the number of swaps and the indices to swap is consistent with the problem description.
   - The program ensures that the number of swaps is no more than 2, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program is correctly designed to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, performs the binary search, and outputs the correct number of swaps and indices to achieve the goal. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
