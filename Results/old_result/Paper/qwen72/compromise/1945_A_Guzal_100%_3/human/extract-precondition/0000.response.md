Precondition: **The function should take three non-negative integers a, b, c (0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9) as input, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.** 

However, the provided function definition is missing the parameters. It should be:
```
def func(a, b, c):
```
This ensures that the function can receive the necessary inputs to perform the calculation.
