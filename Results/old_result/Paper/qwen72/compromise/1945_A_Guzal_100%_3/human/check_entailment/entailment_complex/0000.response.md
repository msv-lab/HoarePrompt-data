Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.

2. **Introverts Handling**: Each introvert must have a tent alone, so the function correctly adds `a` to the total number of tents `k`.

3. **Extroverts Handling**: Each extrovert requires a tent with exactly two other people. The function checks if it is possible to form such tents by ensuring that the remainder of `b` when divided by 3 can be accommodated by the universals `c`. If `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it means there are not enough universals to form the required tents, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

4. **Universals Handling**: Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. The function calculates the number of additional tents needed for extroverts and universals together by dividing `(b + c)` by 3. If there is a remainder, it adds one more tent to ensure all participants are accommodated.

5. **Tent Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the total number of tents `k` by adding the number of introverts `a` to the number of tents required for extroverts and universals. The additional check for `(b + c) % 3` ensures that any remaining participants are accommodated in an extra tent.

6. **Output**: The function prints the calculated number of tents `k` for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above points, the function appears to handle all the specified conditions and constraints correctly.

Correctness: **True**
