Reasoning:

1. **Introverts (a)**:
   - Each introvert must have a tent to themselves. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is exactly `a`.

2. **Extroverts (b)**:
   - Each extrovert must be in a tent with exactly two other people. Therefore, the number of tents required for extroverts is `b // 3` (full tents) plus potentially one more tent if there are any remaining extroverts (i.e., `b % 3 != 0`).

3. **Universals (c)**:
   - Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. They can fill in the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents.

4. **Check for Impossibility**:
   - If `b % 3 != 0` (i.e., there are remaining extroverts), and `b % 3 + c < 3`, it is impossible to accommodate the remaining extroverts because there are not enough universals to fill the tent to the required 3 people. In this case, the function correctly prints `-1`.

5. **Calculate Total Tents**:
   - The total number of tents required is the sum of the tents for introverts and the tents for extroverts, plus any additional tents needed for the remaining universals.
   - The function calculates the total number of tents as `a + (b + c) // 3` and adds 1 if `(b + c) % 3 != 0` to account for any remaining people that need a tent.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all zero correctly by printing `0`.
   - It also handles large inputs (up to \(10^9\)) correctly by performing integer division and modulus operations.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly handle all the requirements and edge cases described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
