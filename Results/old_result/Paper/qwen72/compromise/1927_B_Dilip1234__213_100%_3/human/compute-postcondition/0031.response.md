Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `char_count[1]` is incremented by 1 and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
