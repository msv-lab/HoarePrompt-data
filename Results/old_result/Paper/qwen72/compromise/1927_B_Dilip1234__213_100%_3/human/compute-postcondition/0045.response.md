The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range `26`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, the loop iterates over the range `26`, and the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `26`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 to 1.

Since the loop head does not involve `i` or `s`, these variables remain unchanged. The `char_count` array is also not part of the loop head, so it remains as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' followed by the characters that were added during the loop execution.**
