The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` relative to `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5. At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will be 1. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 1, `j` is 25, and `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
