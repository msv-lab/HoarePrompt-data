Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `char_count[j]` is equal to `a[i]`, then `char_count[j]` is incremented by 1, `s` is the string containing the character corresponding to the ASCII value of `j` + 97, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.***
