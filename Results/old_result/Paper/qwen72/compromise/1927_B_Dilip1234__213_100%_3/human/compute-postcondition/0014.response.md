The only variables in the loop head are `j` and the range `26`. The state of `j` needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, as it is the loop variable that is incremented with each iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, making it 2. The range `26` remains unchanged, as it is a constant value and does not change with each iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and `s` is the string 'ab'.**
