The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should start at 0. The other variables (`a`, `s`, `char_count`) are not part of the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `i` is 0**
