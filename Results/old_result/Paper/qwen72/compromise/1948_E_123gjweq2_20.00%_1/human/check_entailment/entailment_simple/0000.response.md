Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input. This is done correctly.

2. **Clique Calculation**: The program calculates the number of cliques using `ceil(n / k)`. This is a correct approach because the number of cliques is determined by how many segments of size `k` can fit into `n`.

3. **Array Initialization**: The program initializes two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of size `n` with zeros. This is a good starting point.

4. **Function `make_array`**: This function is responsible for populating the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays. It divides the segment from `left` to `right` into two parts and assigns values to `arr` and `clique` values to `cliquess`.

5. **Populating `arr` and `cliquess`**:
   - The first loop in `make_array` assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` to the first half of the segment.
   - The second loop assigns values from `big_element` to `big_element - (not_mid - 1)` to the second half of the segment.
   - Both loops correctly set the corresponding `clique` value in `cliquess`.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints `arr`, which should contain distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It prints the number of cliques, which is `cliques`.
   - It prints `cliquess`, which should indicate the clique each vertex belongs to.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- **Indexing in `make_array`**: The `make_array` function is called with `i * k` and `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`. This can lead to incorrect indexing if `n` is not a multiple of `k`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 4`, the last call to `make_array` will be with `left = 4` and `right = 4`, which is correct, but the function assumes `right` is always greater than or equal to `left`.

- **Output of `cliquess`**: The program initializes `cliquess` to all zeros and then sets the values correctly in `make_array`. However, the final output of `cliquess` is all zeros, which is incorrect. The values in `cliquess` should reflect the clique assignments.

- **Handling of `arr` and `cliquess`**: The program does not ensure that the values in `arr` are distinct and range from 1 to `n`. The way `make_array` is called and the values are assigned might not guarantee this.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it does not produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
