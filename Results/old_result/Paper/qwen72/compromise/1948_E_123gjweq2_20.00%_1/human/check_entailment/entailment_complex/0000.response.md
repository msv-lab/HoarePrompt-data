### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`, which is a reasonable approach given the problem constraints.
   - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
   - The function then calls `make_array` for each clique, passing the appropriate indices and the clique number.
   - After the calls to `make_array`, it prints the `arr` list, the number of cliques, and the `cliquess` list.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function is responsible for filling the `arr` and `cliquess` lists for a specific segment of the graph.
   - It calculates the `small_element` and `big_element` for the segment, and then divides the segment into two parts: the first half is filled with increasing values starting from `small_element`, and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `big_element`.
   - The `cliquess` list is filled with the value of `clique` for the entire segment.

3. **Graph Construction**:
   - The problem requires that for every pair of vertices `(i, j)`, an edge is added if `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - The way `arr` is filled ensures that the values assigned to vertices are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
   - The function `make_array` ensures that the values in `arr` are assigned in a way that minimizes the number of cliques, as it tries to group vertices into segments of size `k` or less.

4. **Clique Partitioning**:
   - The function `func_1` prints the `arr` list, which contains the values assigned to the vertices.
   - It then prints the number of cliques, which is `ceil(n / k)`.
   - Finally, it prints the `cliquess` list, which should indicate the clique each vertex belongs to. However, the `cliquess` list is initialized to all zeros and is not updated correctly within the `make_array` function. This means that the output for the clique partitioning is incorrect.

5. **Output Issues**:
   - The `cliquess` list should be updated to reflect the correct clique assignments, but it remains all zeros. This means that the output for the clique partitioning is incorrect, and the program does not meet the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the `cliquess` list is not updated correctly, leading to an incorrect output for the clique partitioning.

Correctness: **False**
