### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.

2. **Sum and Mean Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total amount of water in all containers using `sum(nums)`.
   - It then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers `n` using `if total % n != 0`. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. This means the condition `total % n != 0` will never be true, and the program will always proceed to the next steps.

3. **Mean Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the mean amount of water that each container should have after the operations, which is `total // n`.

4. **Water Balance Check:**
   - The program initializes a variable `curr` to 0. This variable is used to track the cumulative difference between the current amount of water in the containers and the mean.
   - For each container, it updates `curr` by adding the difference between the current amount of water in the container and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr` becomes negative, it means that it is impossible to balance the water using the allowed operations (pouring from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index). This is because a negative `curr` indicates that more water has been poured out than can be added back to balance the containers.

5. **Output:**
   - If the loop completes without `curr` becoming negative, the program returns "YES", indicating that it is possible to balance the water.
   - If `curr` becomes negative at any point, the program returns "NO", indicating that it is impossible to balance the water.

### Evaluation of the Function Summary:
- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`. It correctly states that the function checks if the cumulative deviation from the mean ever becomes negative and returns "NO" if it does, otherwise "YES".
- The summary also correctly notes that the list `nums` remains unchanged after the function execution.

### Final Assessment:
- The original assessment is accurate in its reasoning and conclusion.
- The unnecessary check for `total % n != 0` does not affect the correctness of the program because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
- The logic for checking the balance of water is sound and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
