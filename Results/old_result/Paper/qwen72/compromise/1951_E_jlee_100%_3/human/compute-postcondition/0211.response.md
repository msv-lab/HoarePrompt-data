Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0. The current value of `count` is greater than 0, `done` remains False, and the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`. Additionally, `count2` is greater than `count`.**
