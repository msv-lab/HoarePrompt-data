Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is 0, `count2` is 0, `done` is True, `j` is 0, and the character at the `j`-th position in `s` is not equal to the character at the `(n - 1 - j)`-th position in `s`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
