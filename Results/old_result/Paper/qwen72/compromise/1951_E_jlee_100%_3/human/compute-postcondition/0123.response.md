Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` was initially less than 1, `count` is set to 2 and the program skips the rest of the current iteration. Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.***
