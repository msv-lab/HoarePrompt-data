Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `s[j]` is equal to `x`, `count2` is increased by 1, and `done` is False. If `count` > 0 and `count2` is greater than or equal to `count`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` > 0 and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `count` is less than 1 and `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count` is set to 2, `done` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values.***
