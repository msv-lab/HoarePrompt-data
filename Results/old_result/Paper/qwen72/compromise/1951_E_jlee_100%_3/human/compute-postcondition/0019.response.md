Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`. The current value of `x` is the same as all characters in `s`. We continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
