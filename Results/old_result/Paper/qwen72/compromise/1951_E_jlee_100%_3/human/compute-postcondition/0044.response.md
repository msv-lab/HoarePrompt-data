Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is equal to `j`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, the character at index `j` in `s` is not equal to `x`, `count` is less than 1, and `done` remains False.**

The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Since `continue` does not change any variable values, the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
