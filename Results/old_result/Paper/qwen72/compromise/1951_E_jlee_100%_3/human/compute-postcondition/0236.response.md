Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- `count2` is 1.
- If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count` is less than 1, `count` is set to 1.
- If `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False.
- Otherwise, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(string[:j], string[j:])
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial Values:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s`.

2. **Conditions:**
   - The condition `if s[j] is not equal to x and count is less than 1` sets `count` to 1, but this does not affect `j` or the slicing of `string`.
   - The condition `if s[j] equals s[n - 1 - j]` checks if the second character of `s` is equal to the second-to-last character of `s`. If they are equal, `done` remains False. If they are not equal, `done` is set to True and the loop breaks.

3. **Slicing the String:**
   - The `print` statement slices the string `string` into two parts:
     - `string[:j]` which is the substring from the start of `string` up to (but not including) the character at index `j`.
     - `string[j:]` which is the substring from the character at index `j` to the end of `string`.

4. **Given `j` is 1:**
   - `string[:j]` will be the first character of `string`.
   - `string[j:]` will be the rest of the string starting from the second character.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will output the first character of `string` followed by the rest of the string starting from the second character.

Output: **[first character of string], [rest of string starting from the second character]**
