Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `count` is greater than 0, `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
