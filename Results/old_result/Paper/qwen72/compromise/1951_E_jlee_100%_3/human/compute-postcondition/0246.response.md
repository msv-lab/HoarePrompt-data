Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 1, and `count2` is 1. If `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `count` is less than 1, `count2` is 0, `done` remains False, and the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
