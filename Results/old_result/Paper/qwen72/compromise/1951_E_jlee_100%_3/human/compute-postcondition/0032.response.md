Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s`, `done` is False, `x` is the first character of `s`. If `n` is 1, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `x` is not equal to the last character of `s`, we also continue to the next iteration of the loop. If `s.count(x) == n`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `x` appears exactly `n - 1` times in `s` and `n` is odd, the middle character of `s` is not equal to `x`. If `n` is even or `n` is odd and the middle character of `s` is equal to `x`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. `count` is 0.**
