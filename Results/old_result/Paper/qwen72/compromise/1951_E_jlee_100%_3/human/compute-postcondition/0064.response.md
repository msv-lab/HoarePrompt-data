Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count2` is 0, `j` is 0, `count` is 1, the current value of `s[j]` is not equal to `x`, and `done` remains False. The `continue` statement causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**
