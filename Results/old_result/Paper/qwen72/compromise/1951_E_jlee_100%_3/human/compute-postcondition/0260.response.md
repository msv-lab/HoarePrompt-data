Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided to determine what will be printed by the `print(1)` statement.

### Initial State:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `i` is 1.
- `string` is an input string.
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 2.
- `count` is a variable that is greater than 0.
- `count2` is a variable whose value is not explicitly given but is determined by the conditions.

### Conditions:
1. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True.
2. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count`, and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True.
3. If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count`, and `count` is less than 1, `count2` is set to 0, `done` remains False.
4. If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True.
5. If `s[j]` equals `x`, `count2` is 2.
6. If `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False.
7. Otherwise, `done` is True.

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement is a simple print statement that prints the integer 1.
- The conditions provided do not affect the value being printed by the `print(1)` statement.
- The conditions are used to determine the value of the `done` variable, but they do not influence the output of the `print(1)` statement.

### Conclusion:
The `print(1)` statement will always print the integer 1, regardless of the values of the variables and conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **1**
