Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2, `x` is the first character of `s`, `j` is 2, `count` is 2, and if `s[j]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the variables retain their initial values.**

The `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables but causes the program to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration. Therefore, all the initial conditions and variable values remain the same.
