Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `i` is 2.
- `string` is an input string (the exact value is not specified).
- `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
- `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 1.
- `x` is the first character of `s`.
- `j` is 1.
- `done` remains False.

The `print` statement in the code snippet is:
```
print(string)
```

This statement will print the value of the `string` variable. Since the exact value of `string` is not provided in the initial state, we can only describe it as an input string.

Output: **[string] (where [string] is the input string)**
