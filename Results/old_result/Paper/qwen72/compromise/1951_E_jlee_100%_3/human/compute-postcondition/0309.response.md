Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `string` is an input string, `s` is a list of characters from `string`, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `x` is the first character of `s`, `count` is the index of the first character in `s` that is not equal to `x`, `count2` is the number of characters in `s` that are equal to `x` after the first character that is not equal to `x`, `done` is False. If `x` is not equal to the last character in `s`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.***
