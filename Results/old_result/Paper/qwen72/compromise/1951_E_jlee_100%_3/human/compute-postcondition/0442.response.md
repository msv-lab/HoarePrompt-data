Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads a string `string` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |string| ≤ 10^6). The function checks if the string can be split into one or two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are different. If such a split is possible, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of substrings (1 or 2) and the substrings themselves. If no such split is possible, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is as described in the annotation, with `t` being greater than 0, `i` being `t-1`, and the last processed variables retaining their final values. **
