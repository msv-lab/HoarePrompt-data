To determine what will be printed by the `print(string)` statement, let's analyze the initial state and the conditions provided:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `string` is an input string.
   - `s` is a list of characters from `string`.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 2.
   - `x` is the first character of `s`.
   - `j` is 2.

2. **Conditions:**
   - If `count` is greater than 0, the following conditions apply:
     - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` is less than `count`, `done` is True.
     - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count`, and `count` is greater than 1, `done` is True.
     - If `s[j]` is not equal to `x` and `count2` equals `count`, and `count` is less than 1, `count2` is set to 0, `done` remains False.
     - If `count2` is greater than `count`, `done` is True.
     - If `s[j]` equals `x`, `count2` is 2.
     - If `s[j]` equals `s[n - 1 - j]`, `done` remains False.
     - Otherwise, `done` is True.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The `print(string)` statement will print the value of the `string` variable.
   - The `string` variable is an input string, and its value is not explicitly defined in the initial state.
   - The conditions provided do not change the value of `string` or `s` (the list of characters from `string`).

Since the value of `string` is not explicitly defined and remains an input string, the `print(string)` statement will simply print the input string as it is.

Output: **string (where string is the input string provided)**
