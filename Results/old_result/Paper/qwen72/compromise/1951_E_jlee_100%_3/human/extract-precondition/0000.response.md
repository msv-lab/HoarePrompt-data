Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of strings s where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings s across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def partition_non_palindromes(t, test_cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and test_cases is a list of strings where each string consists of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^6). The sum of the lengths of all strings in test_cases does not exceed 10^6.**
