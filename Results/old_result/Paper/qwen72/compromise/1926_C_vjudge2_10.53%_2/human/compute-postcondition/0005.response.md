Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the last integer input between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`.**

The code initializes a new list `values` with a length equal to the maximum value in the list `numbers` plus one. Each element in `values` is set to 0. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `numbers` remain unchanged.
