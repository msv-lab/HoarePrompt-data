Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the largest number. It then calculates a cumulative sum of values for numbers up to the largest `n` across all test cases, where each value is determined by the sum of the values of its last digit and the remaining part of the number. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum for each `n` in the test cases. The function does not return any value; it only performs input and output operations. **
