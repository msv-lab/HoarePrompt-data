The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the constant `10`, so we can only adjust `i` to ensure the loop can execute. The loop `for i in range(10):` will execute 10 times, starting with `i` set to 0 and incrementing by 1 until `i` is 9. The initial state of `i` should be 0 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is the last integer input between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `numbers` is a list containing `t` integers, each between 1 and 2 · 10^5, `values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`, `sum_values` is a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`, `total` is 0, `i` is 0**
