Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Initialization of `n` for the loop:**
   - The variable `n` is used as the upper limit for the loop where the digit sums are calculated. However, `n` is the last number in the list `numbers`, which might not be the maximum number in the list. This can lead to incorrect results if the maximum number in `numbers` is not the last one.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation:**
   - The way the digit sum is calculated for numbers greater than 9 is incorrect. The program splits the number into its last digit and the remainder, but it should sum all the digits of the number, not just the last digit and the remaining part.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is not efficient enough to handle the upper limit of \( n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \) within the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The current approach has a time complexity of \( O(n \cdot t) \), which is too slow.

### Correct Approach:
A more efficient and correct approach would be to precompute the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and then use this precomputed array to answer each test case in constant time.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def precompute_digit_sums(max_n):
    values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    sum_values = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        values[i] = sum_of_digits(i)
        sum_values[i] = sum_values[i - 1] + values[i]
    return sum_values

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    max_n = 2 * 10**5
    sum_values = precompute_digit_sums(max_n)
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **`sum_of_digits` function:**
   - This function calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `n`.

2. **`precompute_digit_sums` function:**
   - This function precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 1 to \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \) and stores them in the `sum_values` array. This ensures that we can quickly look up the sum for any `n` in the range.

3. **`func_1` function:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads `n` and prints the precomputed sum of digit sums for `n`.

This approach has a time complexity of \( O(1) \) for each test case after an initial precomputation step of \( O(max_n) \), which is efficient enough to handle the constraints.
