### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers `n` for each test case. These integers are stored in the list `numbers`.

2. **Initialization**: 
   - `values` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `max(numbers) + 1`. This list will store the sum of the digits for each number from 0 to the maximum `n` in the test cases.
   - `sum_values` is also initialized as a list of zeros with the same length. This list will store the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to each number.

3. **Digit Sum Calculation for Numbers 1 to 9**:
   - The program correctly sets the values for numbers 1 to 9 in the `values` list.
   - It also updates the `sum_values` list to store the cumulative sum of these values.

4. **Digit Sum Calculation for Numbers 10 to n**:
   - For each number `i` from 10 to `n`, the program converts the number to a string to extract the last digit and the remainder of the number.
   - The last digit is stored in `last` and the remainder (all digits except the last) is stored in `remainder`.
   - The sum of the digits for `i` is calculated as `values[last] + values[remainder]`.
   - The cumulative sum is updated in `sum_values` by adding the current digit sum to the previous cumulative sum.

5. **Output**:
   - For each `n` in the `numbers` list, the program prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums up to `n` from the `sum_values` list.

### Issues:
- **Variable Scope**: The function `func_1()` is called at the beginning, but it should be defined before it is called.
- **Loop Bound**: The loop `for i in range(10, n + 1):` should use `max(numbers) + 1` instead of `n + 1` to ensure that the `values` and `sum_values` lists are populated up to the maximum number in the test cases.
- **Efficiency**: The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it precomputes the digit sums and cumulative sums in O(max(numbers)) time, which is suitable for the given constraints.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    numbers = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        numbers.append(n)
    max_n = max(numbers)
    values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    sum_values = [0 for _ in range(max_n + 1)]
    total = 0
    for i in range(10):
        values[i] = i
        total += i
        sum_values[i] = total
    for i in range(10, max_n + 1):
        word = str(i)
        last = int(word[-1])
        remainder = int(word[:-1])
        values[i] = values[last] + values[remainder]
        sum_total = values[i] + sum_values[i - 1]
        sum_values[i] = sum_total
    for n in numbers:
        print(sum_values[n])

func_1()
```
