The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, and `b` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100), a list `a` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9), and a list `b` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 <= b_1 <= b_2 <= ... <= b_n <= 10^9). The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not defined in the given constraints.**
