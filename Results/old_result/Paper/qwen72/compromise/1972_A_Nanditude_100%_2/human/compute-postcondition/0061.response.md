The only objects in the loop head are the variables `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n` and the current value of `j`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `j`.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `j` is 2, `cnt` is 1 if `b[1]` is less than `a[0]`, otherwise `cnt` is 0 and `i` is 1**
