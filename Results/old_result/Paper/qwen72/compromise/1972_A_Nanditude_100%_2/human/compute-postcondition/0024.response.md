The value of `n` is updated to the integer value provided by the input. The other variables remain unchanged. The specific value of `n` is now the input integer, and the initial conditions for `t`, `_`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `j`, and `cnt` are still valid.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` is the input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `i` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to the corresponding elements in `b` up to the last element of `b`, `j` is `n-1`, and `cnt` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` up to the last element of `b`.**
