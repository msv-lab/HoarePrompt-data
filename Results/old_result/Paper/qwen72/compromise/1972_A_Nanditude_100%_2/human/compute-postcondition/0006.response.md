Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder (no specific value required), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order with 1 <= a_1 <= a_2 <= ... <= a_n <= 10^9, `b` is a list of integers input by the user, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0.**

The code snippet `i = 0` initializes the variable `i` to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
