Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder, `n` is the new input integer that must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `b` is a new list of integers input by the user, `j` is 2, `i` is 1 if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `i` is 2, `cnt` is 2 if `b[1]` is less than `a[0]` and `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 1 if `b[1]` is less than `a[0]` or `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, and `cnt` is 0 if neither `b[1]` is less than `a[0]` nor `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.***
