The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `b` of length `n` from the input. The string `b` consists of '.', '@', and '*' characters, representing empty cells, cells with coins, and cells with thorns, respectively. The function counts the number of '@' characters (coins) in the string `b` until it encounters a '*' character (thorn), at which point it stops counting and prints the total count of coins for that test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state of the program is such that `s` is 0, `a` is the number of test cases, `i` is `a - 1` (which is `t - 1`), `d` is the last input integer, `b` is the last input string, and `j` is the last index of `b` (i.e., `len(b) - 1`).
