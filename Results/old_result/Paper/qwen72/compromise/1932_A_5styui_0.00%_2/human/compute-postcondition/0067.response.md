Postcondition: ***`s` is 0 or 1, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 3 characters, `j` is 2. If `b[j + 1]` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution without any changes to the variables.***
