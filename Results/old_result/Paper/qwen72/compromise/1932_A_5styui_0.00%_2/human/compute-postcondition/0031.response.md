Postcondition: ***`s` is 0 or 1, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string with at least 3 characters, and `j` is 2. If the character at position `j + 1` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the same variable values.***
