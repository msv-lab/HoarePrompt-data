Postcondition: ***`s` is 0 or 1, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an input integer, `b` is an input string with at least 2 characters, and `j` is 1. If `b[j]` is '@', `s` is set to 1 or 2. If `b[j]` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of. If `b[j]` is neither '@' nor '*', the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
