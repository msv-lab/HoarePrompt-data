Postcondition: ***`s` is 0 or 1, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is a new input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, and `j` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '@', `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is '*', or if the first character is not '*' but the second character is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with `s` remaining 0.***
