Postcondition: ***`s` is 0 or 1, `t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 1 character, and `j` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '@', `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is '*', or the second character of `b` is '*', the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the program continues with the next statement.***
