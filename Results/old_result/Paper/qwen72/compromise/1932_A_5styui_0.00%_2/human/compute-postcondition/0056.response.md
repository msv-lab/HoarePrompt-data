Output State: **`s` is 1 or 2, `t` is an input integer (1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000), `a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an input integer, `b` is a new input string that must have at least 2 characters, `j` is 1.**

The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
