The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle or generate test cases involving an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, an integer `x` where 2 <= x <= 1000. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns without additional information. 

However, if we assume that the function is designed to process these test cases, the functionality might be to return a result based on the value of `x` for each of the `t` test cases. Since the exact output is not provided, we can only describe the potential input and leave the output unspecified.

Functionality: **The function is designed to handle or generate test cases involving an integer `t` where 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, an integer `x` where 2 <= x <= 1000. The specific return value or output is not provided.**
