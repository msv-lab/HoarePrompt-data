The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. The state of `t` and the individual test cases `x` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that the input is a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, the input must be a positive integer, `i` is 0**
