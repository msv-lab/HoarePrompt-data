The function reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` from the input, where `2 <= x <= 1000`. It then computes `y` as the integer division of `x` by 2 and prints `y`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the state of the program includes the printed results of the integer divisions for each test case.
