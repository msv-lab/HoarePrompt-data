You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000, and y is the integer result of x // 2.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \le y < x \) and the value \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is the largest integer that divides both \( x \) and \( y \) without leaving a remainder.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \) and sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \).
   - It then prints \( y \).

3. **Evaluating the Solution:**
   - The program sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \), which is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a candidate for \( y \).
   - We need to check if \( y = x // 2 \) always maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **GCD Analysis:**
   - If \( x \) is even, \( x // 2 \) is exactly half of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = x // 2 \).
   - If \( x \) is odd, \( x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a candidate for \( y \), and \( \gcd(x, x // 2) \) will be a divisor of \( x \) that is less than \( x // 2 \).

5. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \):**
   - For even \( x \), \( \gcd(x, x // 2) + x // 2 = x // 2 + x // 2 = x \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( \gcd(x, x // 2) + x // 2 \) will be less than \( x \), but \( y = x // 2 \) is still a valid candidate and often provides a high value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

6. **Checking for Better Candidates:**
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the best candidate because it maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is a good candidate, but we should also consider \( y = x - 1 \) (the largest integer less than \( x \)). However, \( \gcd(x, x - 1) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(x, x - 1) + (x - 1) = 1 + (x - 1) = x \), which is the same as \( x // 2 \) for even \( x \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program always sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \), which is a valid and often optimal choice for \( y \) in terms of maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - The program does not explicitly check for other possible values of \( y \), but \( y = x // 2 \) is a reasonable and correct choice based on the problem constraints and the properties of GCD.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it always finds a valid \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for the given constraints.
