Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 2`, `n` must be greater than `y + 2`, `a` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `a` is assigned the element at index `x` in the list `l`.
- Since `x` is defined as `y + 2`, `a` is the element at index `y + 2` in the list `l`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
