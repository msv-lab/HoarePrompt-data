Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 3. If the fourth element in the list `l` is greater than the third element in the list `l`, then `b` is set to the fourth element in the list `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `y` remain unchanged.***
