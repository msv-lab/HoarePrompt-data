Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 3, `x` is `n`, `b` is the fourth element of `l`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = l[y]` assigns the value of the fourth element in the list `l` to the variable `b`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
