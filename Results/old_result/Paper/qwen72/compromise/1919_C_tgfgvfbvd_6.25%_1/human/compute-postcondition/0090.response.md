The only objects in the loop head are variables `y` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `y` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must still be greater than `y` (which means `n` must be greater than 3).

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `y` is 3**
