Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `y` must be less than `n - 1`, `x` is `y + 3`, `n` must be greater than `y + 3`, `b` is the value of `l[y + 3]`.**

Explanation:
- The code `b = l[x]` assigns the value of the element at index `x` in the list `l` to the variable `b`.
- Since `x` is defined as `y + 3`, the value of `b` is `l[y + 3]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
