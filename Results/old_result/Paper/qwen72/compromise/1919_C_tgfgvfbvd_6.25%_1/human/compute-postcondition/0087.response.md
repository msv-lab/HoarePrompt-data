The value of `b` is updated to the value of the third element in the list `l` (since `y` is 2, and list indices start at 0). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `b` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 2**.
