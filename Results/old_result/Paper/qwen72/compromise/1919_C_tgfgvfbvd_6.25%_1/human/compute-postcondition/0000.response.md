The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range generated by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value passed to `range` must be a positive integer, indicating the number of iterations.

Given the problem statement, the number of test cases, `t`, is provided at the beginning and must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Therefore, the input to `range` should be `t`.

To ensure the loop executes, the state must reflect that `t` is a positive integer and that the loop variable `_` is initialized appropriately for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0**
