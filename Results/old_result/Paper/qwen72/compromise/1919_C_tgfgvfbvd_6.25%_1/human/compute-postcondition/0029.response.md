Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `c` is 0, and `y` must be less than `n - 1`. If `l[x] - a >= l[x] - b`, then `a` is set to `l[x]`, and `b` remains the first element in the list `l` that is greater than its preceding element, or 0 if no such element exists. Otherwise, `b` is set to `l[x]`, and `a` remains the first element of the list `l`. In both cases, the current value of `l[x]` is greater than the new value of `a` and greater than the new value of `b`.***
