Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 3, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the first element in the list `l`, `c` is 0, `y` is 3, `x` is `n`, and `b` is either the second element of `l` if `l[1] > l[0]` or 0 otherwise. If `l[3] > l[2]`, `b` is set to the fourth element of `l`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
