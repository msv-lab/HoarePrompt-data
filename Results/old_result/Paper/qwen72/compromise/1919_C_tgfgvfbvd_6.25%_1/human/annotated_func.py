#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The total number of test cases, t, is provided at the beginning and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = l[0]
        
        b = 0
        
        c = 0
        
        y = 0
        
        for y in range(1, n):
            if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
                b = l[y]
                break
        
        for x in range(y + 1, n):
            if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
                if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                    a = l[x]
                else:
                    b = l[x]
                c += 1
            elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
                if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                    a = l[x]
                else:
                    b = l[x]
            elif a >= l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        
        print(c)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is `t - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is a list of integers provided by the user, `a` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed by the loop, `b` is the last element in the list `l` that was processed by the loop, `c` is the number of times the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` was true during the loop, `y` is the index of the first element in `l` that is greater than its preceding element (or `n-1` if no such element exists), and `x` is `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `l` of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies specific elements in the array and counts the number of times certain conditions are met. Specifically, it finds the first element in the array that is greater than its preceding element and then iterates through the rest of the array to count how many times an element is greater than both `a` and `b` (where `a` and `b` are dynamically updated based on the values in the array). The function prints the count `c` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes without returning any value.
