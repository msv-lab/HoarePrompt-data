The function `func_1` takes in parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. It calculates the scores for two players, Bodya and Sasha, based on their respective positions `PB` and `PS` in the permutation `p`. The function returns 'Bodya' if Bodya's score is greater than Sasha's score, 'Sasha' if Sasha's score is greater than Bodya's score, and 'Draw' if both scores are equal. The function does not modify any of its input parameters.
