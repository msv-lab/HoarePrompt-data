### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all shifts.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function processes a single binary string `s`.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function processes multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the binary string.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that the cost of sorting a binary string can be minimized by focusing on the transitions from '1' to '0'.
   - Each time a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's, a cyclic shift of the substring containing all the '1's and the '0' is required.
   - The cost of such a shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's in the sequence.
   - This approach correctly calculates the minimum cost for sorting the string.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - It also handles the case where the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111") by not adding any cost.
   - The program handles the case where the string is a single character (though the problem specifies 2 â‰¤ |s|, this is a good check).

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is O(|s|), where |s| is the length of the string.
   - The overall time complexity of `func_2` is O(t * |s|), where t is the number of test cases and |s| is the length of the string for each test case.
   - Given the constraints, this complexity is efficient and within the allowed limits.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:
- **Handling Cyclic Nature:**
  - The original assessment does not explicitly mention the cyclic nature of the shifts. However, the logic in `func_1` implicitly handles the cyclic nature by considering the transitions from '1' to '0'.
  - For example, in the string "101011", the function correctly calculates the cost as 5 by considering the transitions:
    - "101011" -> "110101" (cost 2)
    - "110101" -> "111010" (cost 3)
  - The function does not explicitly handle the case where the string is cyclically shifted to the beginning, but the logic is still correct because the cost calculation is based on the transitions, which are the same regardless of the starting point.

- **Edge Case Verification:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where the string is already sorted.
  - It also handles the case where the string has no '1's or no '0's.
  - The program does not explicitly handle the case where the string is a single character, but the problem constraints ensure that the string length is at least 2.

### Final Evaluation:
- The provided program is correct and handles all the specified cases and constraints.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for sorting the binary string.
- The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

Final: **True**
