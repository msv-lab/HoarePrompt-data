You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the standard input, where `t` represents the number of test cases and must satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The function calls `func_1` exactly `t` times. The function does not return any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged after the loop execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to minimize the total cost of all shifts.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function processes a single binary string `s`.
     - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through each character in the string `s`.
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function processes multiple test cases.
     - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the binary string.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that the cost of sorting a binary string can be minimized by focusing on the transitions from '1' to '0'.
   - Each time a '0' is encountered after a sequence of '1's, a cyclic shift of the substring containing all the '1's and the '0' is required.
   - The cost of such a shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's in the sequence.
   - This approach correctly calculates the minimum cost for sorting the string.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - It also handles the case where the string has no '1's (e.g., "0000") by not adding any cost.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the string has no '0's (e.g., "1111") by not adding any cost.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of `func_1` is O(|s|), where |s| is the length of the string.
   - The overall time complexity of `func_2` is O(t * |s|), where t is the number of test cases and |s| is the length of the string for each test case.
   - Given the constraints, this complexity is efficient and within the allowed limits.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct and handles all the specified cases and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
