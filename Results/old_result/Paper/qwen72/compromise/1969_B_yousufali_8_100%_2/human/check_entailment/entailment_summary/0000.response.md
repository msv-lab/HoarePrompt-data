### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to determine the minimum cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads a binary string `s` from the input.
   - It initializes `n` to count the number of '1's encountered and `ans` to accumulate the total cost.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then calls `func_1` `t` times, once for each test case.

4. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the cost based on the number of '1's and '0's in the string.
   - The logic is to add `n + 1` to the cost for each '0' that follows at least one '1'. This is because each '0' that follows a '1' requires a cyclic shift to move the '1' to the left, and the cost of such a shift is the length of the substring from the first '1' to the '0' (inclusive).
   - This approach ensures that the string is sorted in non-descending order by moving all '1's to the left of all '0's.

5. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the string "10":
     - `n` becomes 1 when '1' is encountered.
     - When '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 2 (1 + 1).
     - The output is 2, which is correct.
   - For the string "0000":
     - No '1's are encountered, so `ans` remains 0.
     - The output is 0, which is correct.
   - For the string "11000":
     - `n` becomes 2 when '11' is encountered.
     - When the first '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 3 (2 + 1).
     - When the second '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 6 (3 + 3).
     - When the third '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 9 (6 + 3).
     - The output is 9, which is correct.
   - For the string "101011":
     - `n` becomes 1 when the first '1' is encountered.
     - When the first '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 2 (1 + 1).
     - `n` becomes 2 when the second '1' is encountered.
     - When the second '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 5 (2 + 3).
     - The output is 5, which is correct.
   - For the string "01101001":
     - `n` becomes 1 when the first '1' is encountered.
     - When the first '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 2 (1 + 1).
     - `n` becomes 2 when the second '1' is encountered.
     - When the second '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 5 (2 + 3).
     - `n` becomes 3 when the third '1' is encountered.
     - When the third '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 9 (5 + 4).
     - When the fourth '0' is encountered, `ans` becomes 13 (9 + 4).
     - The output is 13, but the correct output should be 11. This indicates a potential issue in the logic.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is almost correct but has a minor flaw. It should only add `n` to `ans` for each '0' that follows at least one '1', not `n + 1`.
   - The correct logic should be:
     - Initialize `ans` to 0.
     - For each '0' that follows at least one '1', add `n` to `ans`.
     - This ensures that the cost is the length of the substring from the first '1' to the '0' (exclusive of the '0').

### Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a logical error in the cost calculation within `func_1`, which leads to incorrect results for some test cases. Specifically, the cost should be `n` instead of `n + 1` for each '0' that follows at least one '1'.
