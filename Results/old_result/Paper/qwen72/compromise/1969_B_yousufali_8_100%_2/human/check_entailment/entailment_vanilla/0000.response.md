### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts of substrings.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted.
   - We need to find the minimum total cost to achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - The function reads a binary string `s` from input.
     - It initializes two variables: `n` to count the number of '1's in the string and `ans` to store the total cost.
     - It iterates through the string:
       - If the current character is '1', it increments `n`.
       - If the current character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it prints `ans`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Correctness of `func_1`:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is based on the observation that to sort a binary string, we need to move all '1's to the right of all '0's.
   - For each '0' encountered, if there are any '1's before it, we need to shift the substring from the first '1' to the current '0' to move the '1's to the right.
   - The cost of such a shift is `n + 1`, where `n` is the number of '1's encountered so far.
   - This logic correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case independently.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the function correctly outputs 0.
   - If the string contains only '0's or only '1's, the function correctly outputs 0.
   - For strings that require multiple shifts, the function correctly calculates the total cost.

The provided program is correct based on the problem description and the reasoning above.
