To determine what will be printed by the given code snippet, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

### Initial State:
- `result` is a list containing the number of screens required for each of the `n` test cases.
- The length of `result` is equal to `n`.
- The values of `t`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **`result` List**:
   - `result` is a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of screens required for a specific test case.
   - The length of `result` is `n`, meaning there are `n` elements in the list.

2. **`map(str, result)`**:
   - The `map` function applies the `str` function to each element in the `result` list.
   - This converts each integer in the `result` list to a string.

3. **`'\n'.join(map(str, result))`**:
   - The `join` method concatenates all the elements of the list (which are now strings) into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - This means that each element of the `result` list will be printed on a new line.

4. **`print` Statement**:
   - The `print` function outputs the concatenated string to the console.

### Final Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the `result` list on a new line. Since the exact values of the elements in `result` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of the elements of `result`.

Output: **[result[0]]
[result[1]]
...
[result[n-1]] (where each [result[i]] is the number of screens required for the i-th test case)**

This format indicates that each element of the `result` list will be printed on a new line, with the exact values of the elements being the number of screens required for each test case.
