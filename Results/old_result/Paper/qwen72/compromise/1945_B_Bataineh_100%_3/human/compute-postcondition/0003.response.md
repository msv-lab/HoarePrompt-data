The function `func` is described with parameter constraints but the function signature provided does not include any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints given, it seems the function should accept parameters `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which likely represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18.

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but typically, such a function would return a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts integers `a`, `b`, and `m` where 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
