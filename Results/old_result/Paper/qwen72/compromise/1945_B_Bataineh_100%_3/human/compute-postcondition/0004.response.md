Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then evaluates a series of conditions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` and prints an integer result for each test case. The final state of the program is that the input values `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain unchanged, but the function has printed a series of integers, one for each test case. **
