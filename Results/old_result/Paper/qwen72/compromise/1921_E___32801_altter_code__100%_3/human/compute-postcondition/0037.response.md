Output State: **`r` is a list of integers. `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3] - a` if `y1` < `y2` else `r[3] - 1 - a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is 1, `x2` is equal to `x1` if `y1` >= `y2`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number if `y1` >= `y2`. `a` is `r[5] - 1` if `y1` >= `y2` else `r[1] - r[5]`. `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. The current value of `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`.**

Explanation:
- `y1` is decremented by `a`.
- The value of `a` is determined based on the condition `y1` >= `y2`.
- If `y1` was originally less than `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - a` after the operation.
- If `y1` was originally greater than or equal to `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1 - a` after the operation.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
