Postcondition: **`r` is a list of integers. `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + 1`, `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `x2` is `r[4]`, and `y2` is `r[5]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number. `y1` is not equal to `y2`, and `y1` is less than or equal to `y2`.**
