Postcondition: **`r` is a list of integers read from the input, `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3]`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is `r[5]`. `x2` is still greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is still even. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`. `b` is `x2 - x1`. `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
