The provided code snippet only contains a `print` statement that outputs the string `'Alice'`. The initial state describes the setup of the function `func_1` and the values of various variables, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is independent of the initial state and will always print the same string.

Output: **Alice**
