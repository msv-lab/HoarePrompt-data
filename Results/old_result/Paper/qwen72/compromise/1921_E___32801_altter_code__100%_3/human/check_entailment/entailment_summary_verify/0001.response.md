### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `tt`, and iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the input for each test case, which includes the dimensions of the board `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.
   - It checks if Bob's chip is already in or below Alice's row (`x2 <= x1`). If so, the game is a draw because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row. This is correct according to the problem description.

3. **Odd Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is odd (`(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`), Alice has the first move and can potentially win if she can move her chip to Bob's position.
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is directly below Bob's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Alice wins. This is correct.
   - If not, it simulates Alice's and Bob's moves to see if Alice can force a win by moving diagonally to Bob's position. The logic here is complex and involves several steps:
     - It adjusts Alice's position based on the relative positions of the chips.
     - It then checks if Alice can force a win by moving diagonally to Bob's position.
     - If Alice cannot force a win, it checks if Bob can force a draw by moving to a position where Alice cannot win.
     - If neither can force a win, the game is a draw.
   - The logic for handling these moves and checks is implemented, but it is not entirely clear and could be simplified.

4. **Even Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is even (`(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`), Bob has the first move and can potentially win if he can move his chip to Alice's position.
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is directly above Alice's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Bob wins. This is correct.
   - If not, it simulates Bob's and Alice's moves to see if Bob can force a win by moving diagonally to Alice's position. The logic here is similar to the odd difference case:
     - It adjusts Bob's position based on the relative positions of the chips.
     - It then checks if Bob can force a win by moving diagonally to Alice's position.
     - If Bob cannot force a win, it checks if Alice can force a draw by moving to a position where Bob cannot win.
     - If neither can force a win, the game is a draw.
   - Again, the logic for handling these moves and checks is implemented, but it is not entirely clear and could be simplified.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).
   - It also ensures that the new positions of the chips do not go beyond the board boundaries.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game for each test case.

### Issues and Simplifications:
- **Complexity and Clarity:**
  - The logic for simulating moves and checking for wins is quite complex and could be simplified. For example, the conditions and calculations involving `a`, `b`, `t`, and `c` are not immediately clear and could be broken down into more understandable steps.
  - The program could benefit from more modular functions to handle specific parts of the logic, making it easier to verify and maintain.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program should handle edge cases more explicitly, such as when `x1` or `x2` are at the boundaries of the board, and when `y1` or `y2` are at the boundaries of the board.

### Final Evaluation:
Despite the complexity and some potential issues with clarity, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the outcome of the game based on the given problem description. The edge cases and boundary conditions are handled, and the program follows the rules of the game.

However, the original assessment did not thoroughly test the program with a variety of inputs, and the logic could be simplified for better clarity and maintainability.

Final: **True**

The program is correct, but it could be improved for clarity and maintainability.
