Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads a string `s` from the user input, where `s` consists of lowercase Latin characters and has a length `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The function checks if the string `s` meets certain conditions using an external function `func_1`. If `func_1(s)` returns `False`, the function prints "YES" followed by "1" and the original string `s`, and then returns. If `func_1(s)` returns `True`, the function searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character. If no such character is found, the function prints "NO" and returns. If such a character is found at index `x`, the function further checks the result of `func_1(s[x + 1:])`. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `False`, the function prints "YES" followed by "2" and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]` separated by a space, and then returns. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, the function prints "NO" if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, otherwise it prints "YES" followed by "2" and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]` separated by a space, and then returns. In all cases, the function does not return any value. **
