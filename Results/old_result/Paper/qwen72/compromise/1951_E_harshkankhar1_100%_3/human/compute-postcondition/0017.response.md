Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`.
   - `x` is the index of the first occurrence of such a character.
   - The values of `n` and `s` remain unchanged.
   - The substring `s[x + 1:]` does not satisfy the condition checked by `func_1`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   ```python
   print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
   ```

3. **Explanation:**
   - `s[:x + 1]` will print the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the character at index `x`.
   - `' '` is a single space character.
   - `s[x + 1:]` will print the substring of `s` starting from the character immediately after the one at index `x` to the end of the string.

4. **Determine the Output:**
   - Since `s` contains at least one character different from `s[0]`, `x` is the index of the first such character.
   - `s[:x + 1]` will include all characters from the start of the string up to and including the first character that is different from `s[0]`.
   - `s[x + 1:]` will include all characters from the first character that is different from `s[0]` to the end of the string.

Given the precondition, the output will be the first part of the string up to and including the first different character, followed by a space, and then the rest of the string.

Output: **[s[:x + 1]] [s[x + 1:]] (where [s[:x + 1]] is the substring of `s` from the start up to and including the first character different from `s[0]`, and [s[x + 1:]] is the substring of `s` starting from the character immediately after the first different character to the end of the string)**
