### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`s[::-1]`).
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It checks if the entire string `s` is a palindrome using `func_1(s)`.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by "1" and the string `s` itself, which is a valid partition since the string is already non-palindromic.
   - If `s` is a palindrome, it searches for the first character in `s` that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
   - If no such character is found (i.e., all characters in `s` are the same), it prints "NO" because it is impossible to partition a string of identical characters into non-palindromic substrings.
   - If a different character is found at index `x`, it further checks if the substring `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" followed by "2" and the substrings `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`, which is a valid partition.
     - If `s[x + 1:]` is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`:
       - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because it cannot partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.
       - Otherwise, it prints "YES" followed by "2" and the substrings `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`, which is a valid partition.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**: If `s` is a single character, `func_1(s)` will return `True` (since a single character is a palindrome), and the function will print "NO" because it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - **All Characters the Same**: If `s` consists of the same character repeated, `func_1(s)` will return `True`, and the function will print "NO" because it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.
   - **Mixed Characters**: If `s` contains mixed characters, the function will find a valid partition that avoids palindromic substrings.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles all edge cases and general cases.
   - It ensures that if a valid partition exists, it is printed, and if no valid partition exists, it prints "NO".
   - The logic for finding the first different character and checking the subsequent substrings is sound and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
