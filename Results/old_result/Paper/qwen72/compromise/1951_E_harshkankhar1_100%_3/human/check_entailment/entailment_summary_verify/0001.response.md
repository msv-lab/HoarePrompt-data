### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1: `func_1(s) -> bool`**
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.
   - This function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - The function reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single part.
     - This is correct because if the string is not a palindrome, it can be partitioned into a single part that is not a palindrome.
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it then tries to find a non-palindromic partition:
     - It iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
     - If no such character is found (`x == -1`), it prints "NO" because the string consists of the same character repeated, making all substrings palindromes.
     - If such a character is found, it checks if the substring from `x + 1` to the end of the string is not a palindrome.
       - If it is not a palindrome, it prints "YES" and the partition of the string into two parts: `s[:x + 1]` and `s[x + 1:]`.
       - This is correct because the first part is guaranteed to be non-palindromic (since it contains at least one different character), and the second part is also non-palindromic.
     - If the substring from `x + 1` to the end is a palindrome, it checks if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`:
       - If `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, it prints "NO" because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts.
       - This is incorrect. The condition `x == 1 or x == n // 2` is too restrictive and does not cover all cases where a non-palindromic partition is possible. For example, if the string is "abccba" and `x` is 1, the function incorrectly prints "NO" even though a valid partition exists (e.g., "ab" and "ccba").
     - If the above conditions are not met, it prints "YES" and the partition of the string into two parts: `s[:x + 2]` and `s[x + 2:]`.
       - This is correct because the first part `s[:x + 2]` will contain at least two different characters, making it non-palindromic, and the second part will also be non-palindromic.

### Issues:
- The condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:` is indeed too restrictive. It incorrectly assumes that if `x` is 1 or `n // 2`, the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic parts. This is not always true, as shown in the example "abccba".

### Correctness:
- The program is **not** correct due to the restrictive condition in the `elif` statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified the issue with the condition `if x == 1 or x == n // 2:`. This condition is indeed too restrictive and can lead to incorrect outputs for valid test cases. Therefore, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is not correct is accurate.
