The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers, where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. It returns 'Alice' if the smallest pile has more than 1 stone or if the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are all 1. Otherwise, it returns 'Bob'.
