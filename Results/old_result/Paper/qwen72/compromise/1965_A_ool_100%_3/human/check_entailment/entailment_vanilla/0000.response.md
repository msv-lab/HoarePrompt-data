### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for determining the winner of the game.
   - It first checks if the smallest pile size is not 1. If so, Alice wins immediately because she can choose a `k` that is the smallest pile size, which will empty all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1, it then checks if the pile sizes are consecutive. This is done by sorting the unique pile sizes and checking the difference between consecutive elements.
   - If the pile sizes are not consecutive, the game state is not simple, and the function toggles the boolean `A` to determine the winner.
   - If the pile sizes are consecutive, the function toggles `A` one more time to account for the special case where all pile sizes are consecutive.

3. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice wins.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are not consecutive, Alice wins.
   - If the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are consecutive, Bob wins.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the smallest pile size is not 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are consecutive correctly.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where the smallest pile size is 1 and the pile sizes are not consecutive correctly. The logic for toggling `A` is flawed.

5. **Flaw in Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` toggles `A` for each consecutive difference, but this is not the correct way to determine the winner.
   - The correct approach should be to check if the number of piles with the smallest size is odd or even. If it is odd, Alice wins; if it is even, Bob wins.

### Correctness:
Given the flawed logic in the `func_1` function, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
