To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
```

Here, the variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `set_`

The loop will execute if the range `range(1, len(set_))` is not empty. This means that `len(set_)` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5.
- `A` is False.
- `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
- `not_c` is True.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of `set_` to ensure it has at least two elements. The variable `i` should be set to 1 for the first iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr` in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1, `set_` must have at least 2 elements, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1**
