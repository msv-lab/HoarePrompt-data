The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`.

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000.
- `n` and `q` are integers such that 1 <= n, q <= 10^5.
- `operations` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains two integers `b` and `x` (with `b` being either 1 or 2, and `1 <= x <= n` for `b=1`, `1 <= x <= 10^9` for `b=2`).
- `queries` is a list of `q` integers, where each integer `k_i` satisfies 1 <= k_i <= min(10^18, c), and `c` is the size of the array after all operations.

The function processes the `operations` and `queries` to produce a result based on the operations performed and the queries asked. The exact return value is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function returns a list of results corresponding to the `queries`.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries`. It processes the operations and queries to return a list of results based on the operations performed and the queries asked.**
