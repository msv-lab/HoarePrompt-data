Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of operations `n` and the number of queries `q`, followed by the operations and queries themselves. It then calls another function `func_1` with `n`, `operations`, and `queries` as arguments and prints the results returned by `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the input variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `operations`, and `queries` is undefined. **
