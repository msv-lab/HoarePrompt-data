The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `operations`, and `queries`. 

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `operations` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers: `(op_type, value)`. `op_type` can be either 1 or 2, and `value` is a positive integer.
- `queries` is a list of positive integers, each representing a query index.

The function returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`. The position of each element in `array` is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The `array` is constructed based on the operations specified in the `operations` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, a list of tuples `operations` where each tuple is `(op_type, value)` with `op_type` being 1 or 2 and `value` a positive integer, and a list of positive integers `queries`. It returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by `queries`, where each position is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The `array` is constructed based on the operations provided.**
