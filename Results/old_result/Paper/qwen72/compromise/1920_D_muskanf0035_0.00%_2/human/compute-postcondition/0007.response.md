Output State: **The program returns a list `result` containing the elements from `array` at the positions specified by the `queries`, where each position is adjusted by taking `(k - 1) % len(array)` for each `k` in `queries`. The `array` is a list containing elements based on the operations performed, and `n` remains a positive integer, `operations` remains the same list of tuples, and `queries` remains the same list of positive integers.**
