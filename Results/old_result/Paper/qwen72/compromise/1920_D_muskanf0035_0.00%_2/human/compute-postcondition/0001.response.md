The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate a specific number of times, and it starts at 0 by default in the context of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
