The provided code snippet `T = TypeVar('T')` introduces a type variable `T` using the `TypeVar` function from the `typing` module. This is typically used in type hints to indicate generic types. However, this code does not affect any of the variables or values mentioned in the initial state.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, v is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. T is a type variable.**
