Postcondition: **new_arr is a list of non-negative integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in cur_arr up to the point where the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0, xor is 0, thing1 is 0, and the current value of the bit-th bit of xor is 1.**

Explanation: The postcondition retains the conditions from the precondition, stating that `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is 0. Additionally, it includes the if condition, which specifies that the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1. This means that the current value of the bit-th bit of `xor` is 1, even though `xor` itself is 0 (which implies that the bit-th bit of 0 is being checked, but the condition is true in this context).
