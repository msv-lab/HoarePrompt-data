Output State: **new_arr is a list of non-negative integers where each element is the cumulative XOR of the elements in cur_arr up to the point where the bit-th bit of the cumulative XOR is 0, xor is 0, thing1 is -1, and the current value of the bit-th bit of xor is 1.**

Explanation: The value of `thing1` is updated to -1, while the other variables (`new_arr`, `xor`, and the current value of the bit-th bit of `xor`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
