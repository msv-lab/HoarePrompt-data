### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If no such array exists, the program should return -1.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to construct this array by recursively breaking down the problem.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function takes two arguments: `number` (which is \( X - 1 \)) and `sequence` (which is the list to be populated).
   - The base case is when `number` is 0, which should return 0, 0. However, this base case is incorrect because it should return -1 if no such array exists.
   - The function attempts to find the smallest `size` such that \( (1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) \) is greater than `number` and the largest `i` such that \( (1 << size) - (1 << i) \leq number \).
   - It then appends `size - overlap` elements to the `sequence` and recursively calls itself with the updated `number`.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - **Base Case**: The base case should return -1 if `number` is 0, not 0, 0. This is a critical error because it will cause the program to print an incorrect result.
   - **Loop and Condition**: The loop and condition for finding `size` and `overlap` seem to be attempting to find a valid subsequence length, but the logic is not clear and may not always produce the correct result.
   - **Recursive Call**: The recursive call updates `number` but does not handle the case where the updated `number` is less than 0, which could lead to infinite recursion or incorrect results.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The program as written does not correctly handle the base case and may produce incorrect results or enter infinite recursion.
   - The logic for generating the sequence is not clearly explained and may not always produce the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has issues with the base case and the recursive logic, which can lead to incorrect results or infinite recursion. The base case should return -1 if `number` is 0, and the recursive logic needs to be carefully reviewed to ensure it correctly generates the required array.
