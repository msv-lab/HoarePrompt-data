Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where `X = 2`. According to the problem description, the array should have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For `X = 2`, the only possible array that meets this requirement is `[0, 1]`, which has exactly two increasing subsequences: `[0]` and `[0, 1]`.

However, the program outputs:
```
1
0
```
This output is incorrect because the array `[0]` has only one increasing subsequence, which is `[0]`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for this specific input, and thus, it is incorrect.
