### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - An increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence of elements from the array where the elements are strictly increasing and the order of elements is preserved.
   - If no such array exists, we should output -1.
   - The input \( X \) is a positive integer in the range \( 2 \le X \le 10^{18} \).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and calls the function `func_1` to generate the sequence.
   - The sequence is then printed along with its length.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence of integers.
   - It uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to \( number \).
   - It then appends a sequence of integers to the `sequence` list.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the remaining number of increasing subsequences to be generated.

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that has a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is generated by appending integers in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is controlled.
   - The use of powers of 2 and the recursive approach is a clever way to manage the number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( X = 2 \) correctly, as the smallest possible number of increasing subsequences (other than 1, which is not allowed) is 2.
   - The program should also handle the case where \( X \) is a large number, such as \( 10^{18} \), and ensure the sequence length does not exceed 200.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly generates a sequence of integers that can form exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence length is managed to ensure it does not exceed 200.
   - The program handles the input and output format correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the reasoning above. It correctly generates the required sequence and handles the constraints and edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
