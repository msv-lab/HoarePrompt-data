You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to generate an array of integers of length at most 200 that has exactly \( X \) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible to find such an array, we should print \(-1\).
   - The elements of the array should be in the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and calls the function `func_1` with \( n-1 \) and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for generating the sequence of integers that will have exactly \( n \) increasing subsequences.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `number` and `sequence`.
   - It uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `number`.
   - It then appends a sequence of integers to `sequence` to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `number + 1`.
   - The function recursively calls itself with the remaining number of increasing subsequences needed.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences is \( 2^k \) for some \( k \).
   - The loop in `func_1` ensures that the sequence is built in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is correctly calculated.
   - The recursive call in `func_1` handles the remaining number of increasing subsequences needed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) is very large (up to \( 10^{18} \)).
   - The program should ensure that the length of the generated sequence does not exceed 200.
   - The program should handle the case where \( X \) is 2, which is the smallest valid input.

6. **Verification**:
   - For \( X = 2 \), the program should generate an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. The output `[0]` is incorrect because it has only 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`).
   - For \( X = 5 \), the program should generate an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences. The output `[0, 1, 0]` is correct because it has the subsequences `[], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0]`.
   - For \( X = 13 \), the program should generate an array with exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The output `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` is correct because it has the subsequences `[], [2], [2], [3], [4], [2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 4], [2, 3, 4], [2, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - For \( X = 37 \), the program should generate an array with exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The output `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` is correct because it has the subsequences `[], [-1], [-1], [0], [0], [2], [3], [-1], [-1, 0], [-1, 0], [-1, 2], [-1, 3], [-1, -1], [-1, -1, 0], [-1, -1, 0], [-1, -1, 2], [-1, -1, 3], [-1, -1, -1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 0], [0, 2, 3], [0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 3], [0, 0, 2, 3], [2, 3], [2, 2], [2, 3, 2], [3, 2], [2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 3, 2], [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 2, 3, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2], [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where \( X = 2 \) correctly. The output for \( X = 2 \) should be a sequence with exactly 2 increasing subsequences, but the program outputs `[0]`, which has only 1 increasing subsequence.

Correctness: **False**
