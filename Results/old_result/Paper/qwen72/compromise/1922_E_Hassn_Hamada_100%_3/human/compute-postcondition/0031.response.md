Output State: **`size` is `i + 5`, `i` is `i + 1`, `value` is `(1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << (i + 1))`**

Explanation:
- The value of `size` remains `i + 5`.
- The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `i + 1`.
- The value of `value` is updated to `(1 << size) - (1 << i)`. Since `size` is `i + 5`, this expression becomes `(1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << (i + 1))`.

Therefore, the output state is: `size` is `i + 5`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `value` is `(1 << (i + 5)) - (1 << (i + 1))`.
