To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given program state:

### Program State Before the Loop:
- `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\)
- `size` is `i + 1`
- `value` is \((1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)\)
- `i` is `i - 1`
- `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`

### Loop Condition:
```
while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The variables in the loop head are `size`, `i`, and `number`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - `size` is `i + 1`
   - `i` is `i - 1`, which means `i` is one less than its initial value.
   - `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`, so `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`.

3. **Substitute the Initial Values into the Loop Condition:**
   - Since `size` is `i + 1`, and `i` is `i - 1`, we need to ensure that the loop condition holds for the initial values of `i` and `size`.
   - Let's assume `i` is `0` initially (since `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`).
   - Therefore, `size` is `0 + 1 = 1`.

4. **Evaluate the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is \((1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number\).
   - Substituting `size = 1` and `i = 0`:
     \[
     (1 << 1 + 1) - (1 << 0) = (1 << 2) - (1 << 0) = 4 - 1 = 3
     \]
   - So the condition becomes \(3 <= \text{number}\).

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `number` must be at least `3`.
   - The given program state already ensures that `number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), which means `number` can be `3` or greater.
   - Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `number`.

6. **Final State:**
   - The only variables that need to be considered are `i` and `size`.
   - `i` must be greater than or equal to `0` to ensure `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
   - `size` must be `i + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The loop can execute the first time if `i` is greater than or equal to `0` and `size` is `i + 1`. Since these conditions are already met by the given state, no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`number` is an integer such that \(2 \leq \text{number} \leq 10^{18}\), `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is \((1 << (i + 1)) - (1 << i)\), `i` is `i - 1`, and `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to `-1`**
