The code snippet assigns new values to `size` and `value` based on the variable `i`. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we need to consider it as an unknown integer. The expression `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)` calculates the difference between `1` shifted left by `i + 1` bits and `1` shifted left by `i` bits, which is equivalent to `2^(i+1) - 2^i` or `2^i`.

Output State: **`number` is an integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, `sequence` is a list of integers that must have at least one element and the maximum value in `sequence` must be greater than -1, `size_overlap` is (0, 0), `size` is `i + 1`, `value` is `2^i`.**
