Output State: **`size` is the smallest integer such that \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > number\), `value` is \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\), and `i` is `i - 1` (where `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`).**

### Natural Language Explanation:
- **`size`**: The loop increments `size` until the condition \((1 << (size + 1)) - (1 << i) > number\) is no longer satisfied. Therefore, after all iterations, `size` will be the smallest integer for which this condition holds true.
- **`value`**: `value` is updated in each iteration to \((1 << size) - (1 << i)\). After the loop finishes, `value` will be the last value calculated before the condition failed.
- **`i`**: The value of `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, and the loop continues as long as `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`. After the loop finishes, `i` will be one less than its initial value, but it will still be greater than or equal to `-1`.
