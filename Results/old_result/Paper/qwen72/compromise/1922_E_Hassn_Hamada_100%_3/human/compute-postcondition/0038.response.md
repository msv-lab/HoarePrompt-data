Output State: **`i` is `i - 1` (where `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`), `size` is `i`, `value` is `2 ** i - 2 ** (i - 1)`**

Explanation:
- `i` is updated to `i - 1`, where `i - 1` is greater than or equal to `-1`.
- `size` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, which simplifies to `i` after `i` is updated to `i - 1`.
- `value` is assigned the value of `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)`, which is equivalent to `2 ** (i + 1) - 2 ** i`. After `i` is updated to `i - 1`, this simplifies to `2 ** i - 2 ** (i - 1)`.
