You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` does not take any parameters, but it is expected to read input from stdin. The input consists of: the first line containing two integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) and t (t=1), the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively. The next n-1 lines each contain two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge between nodes u and v in the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The next line contains t integers (1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n) corresponding to the node where the stone is initially placed for the round.

    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    tree = deque()
    empty = True

            empty = False

            tree.appendleft(u)
        elif v == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(u)
        elif u == tree[0]:
            tree.appendleft(v)
        elif u == tree[-1]:
            tree.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers that form a path in the input graph, `empty` is False.
    start = int(input())
    idx = tree.index(start)
    moves = [min(t, idx), min(t, n - idx - 1)]
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers that form a path in the input graph, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing two elements: the first element is the minimum of `t` and `idx`, and the second element is the minimum of `t` and `n - idx - 1`. If at least one of the elements in `moves` is an odd number, then the program follows the if part. Otherwise, both elements in `moves` are even, and the program follows the else part.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the tree is not a simple linear structure. For example, consider a tree where the nodes form a structure like this:

```
1 - 2 - 3 - 4
     |
     5
```

In this case, the tree has exactly two leaves (nodes 1 and 4), but the program will not correctly build the tree structure, leading to incorrect results. The program assumes that the tree is a simple linear structure, which is not always the case according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this potential case.
