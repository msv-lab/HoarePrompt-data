The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it reads input from stdin. The input consists of the first line containing two integers `n` and `t`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree (with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) and `t` is the number of rounds (with the constraint t=1). The next `n-1` lines each contain two integers `u` and `v` (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) representing an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves. The next line contains `t` integers (1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n) corresponding to the node where the stone is initially placed for the round.

The function processes this input and returns the result of the game based on the initial placement of the stone and the structure of the tree.

Functionality: **The function reads input from stdin consisting of the number of nodes in a tree, the tree's edges, and the initial node where a stone is placed. It returns the result of a game based on the tree structure and the initial placement of the stone.**
