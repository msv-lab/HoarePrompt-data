Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads input from stdin to construct a tree represented as a deque. It then determines the initial position of a stone on one of the nodes and calculates the minimum number of moves the stone can make to either end of the tree. The function prints 'Ron' if at least one of these minimum moves is an odd number, and 'Hermione' otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the tree is represented as a deque containing a sequence of integers that form a path in the input graph, and the initial node position and calculated moves are no longer relevant. **
