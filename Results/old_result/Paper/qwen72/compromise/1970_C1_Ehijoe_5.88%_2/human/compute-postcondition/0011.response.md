Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to determine what will be printed:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5.
   - `t` is 1.
   - `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers that form a path in the input graph.
   - `empty` is False.
   - `start` is an input integer.
   - `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.
   - `moves` is a list containing two elements:
     - The first element is the minimum of `t` and `idx`.
     - The second element is the minimum of `t` and `n - idx - 1`.
   - Both elements in `moves` are even.

2. **Analysis:**
   - `t` is 1, which is an odd number.
   - For `moves` to contain even numbers, both `idx` and `n - idx - 1` must be even.
   - Since `t` is 1, the minimum of `t` and any even number will be 0 (because 0 is even and less than 1).
   - Therefore, both elements in `moves` will be 0, which is even.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The `print('Hermione')` statement will execute and print the string 'Hermione'.
   - The values of the variables and objects do not affect the output of this specific print statement.

Output: **Hermione**
