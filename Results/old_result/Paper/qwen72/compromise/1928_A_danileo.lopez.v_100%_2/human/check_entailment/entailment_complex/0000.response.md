Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can form a different rectangle from the original one by making a cut parallel to one of its sides. The key to solving this problem is to check if either dimension of the rectangle is even. If one dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a new rectangle, provided that the new dimensions are not the same as the original dimensions (considering rotations).

Here's a detailed analysis of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to handle each test case. This is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Even Dimension Check**: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even using the conditions `a % 2 == 0` and `b % 2 == 0`. This is correct because if either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.

3. **New Rectangle Formation Check**:
   - If `a` is even, it calculates `a1` and `a2` as `a // 2`. It then checks if `a1` (or `a2`, which are the same) is not equal to `b`. If `a1 != b`, it prints 'Yes' because Bob can form a new rectangle with dimensions `a1` and `2 * b`.
   - If `b` is even, it calculates `b1` and `b2` as `b // 2`. It then checks if `b1` (or `b2`, which are the same) is not equal to `a`. If `b1 != a`, it prints 'Yes' because Bob can form a new rectangle with dimensions `2 * a` and `b1`.

4. **Output Handling**: If neither condition is met, the program prints 'No'. This is correct because if both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and thus cannot form a different rectangle.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where both `a` and `b` are 1, which is the smallest possible rectangle. In this case, it prints 'No' because no cut can be made.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where one dimension is 1 and the other is even, such as `2 \times 1`. In this case, it prints 'No' because cutting the rectangle would result in two `1 \times 1` squares, which cannot form a different rectangle.

6. **Multiple Test Cases**: The program correctly processes multiple test cases by reading `t` and then iterating `t` times, handling each test case independently.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
