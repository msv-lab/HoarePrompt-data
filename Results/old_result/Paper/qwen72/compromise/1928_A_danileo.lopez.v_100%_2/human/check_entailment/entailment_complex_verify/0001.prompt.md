You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should also be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the values of `a` and `b` will be read from the input, and the loop will print 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even and the condition `a1 != b` or `b1 != a` is satisfied, otherwise it will print 'No'. The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten in each iteration, and `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The function checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If `a` is even and `a // 2` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b // 2` is not equal to `a`, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the values of `a` and `b` are no longer relevant.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If \( a \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - For the new rectangle to be different, the dimensions of the new rectangle formed by combining the two smaller rectangles must not be the same as the original dimensions \( a \times b \) or \( b \times a \).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \) of the rectangle.
   - It checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even:
     - If \( a \) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles and checks if \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \). If true, it prints "Yes".
     - If \( b \) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles and checks if \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \). If true, it prints "Yes".
   - If neither \( a \) nor \( b \) is even, it prints "No".

4. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - If \( a \) is even, the new rectangle formed by combining the two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles will have dimensions \( a \times b \) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \). For it to be different, \( \frac{a}{2} \) must not equal \( b \).
   - If \( b \) is even, the new rectangle formed by combining the two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles will have dimensions \( a \times b \) or \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \). For it to be different, \( \frac{b}{2} \) must not equal \( a \).
   - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle that is different from the original because any cut will result in two rectangles that, when combined, will either be the same as the original or a 90-degree rotation of it.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where both \( a \) and \( b \) are 1, which is the smallest possible rectangle and cannot be cut.
   - The program also correctly handles cases where one dimension is 1 and the other is even, which can form a new rectangle.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given \( a \times b \) rectangle. It checks the necessary conditions and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
