You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters, a and b, which are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function should also be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, t, is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            if a % 2 == 0:
                a1, a2 = a // 2, a // 2
                if a1 != b:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            if b % 2 == 0:
                b1, b2 = b // 2, b // 2
                if b1 != a:
                    print('Yes')
                    continue
            print('No')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the values of `a` and `b` will be read from the input, and the loop will print 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even and the condition `a1 != b` or `b1 != a` is satisfied, otherwise it will print 'No'. The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten in each iteration, and `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is the number of test cases (1 <= t <= 10^4), and `a` and `b` are the dimensions of a rectangle (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). For each test case, the function returns the area of the rectangle. If there are multiple test cases, it returns a list of areas.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
