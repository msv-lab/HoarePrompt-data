Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided. For each test case, the values of `a` and `b` will be read from the input, and the loop will print 'Yes' if either `a` or `b` is even and the condition `a1 != b` or `b1 != a` is satisfied, otherwise it will print 'No'. The values of `a` and `b` will be overwritten in each iteration, and `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration until it reaches 0.**
