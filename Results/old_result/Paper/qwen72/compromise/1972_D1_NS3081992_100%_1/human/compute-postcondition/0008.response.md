Functionality: ** The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` within specified ranges (1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m, where n and m are positive integers). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` such that if `b` is 0, the tuple is `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the arguments `(b, a % b)` and returns a tuple containing the values `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the results of the recursive call. The final state of the program is that it has computed and returned these values, which are related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. **
