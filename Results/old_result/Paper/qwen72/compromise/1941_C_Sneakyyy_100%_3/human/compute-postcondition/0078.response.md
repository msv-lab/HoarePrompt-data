Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a new input string with a length greater than 8, `s` is the substring of `a` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + 2` (i.e., `a[i:i + 3]`). If `s` is 'map' or 'pie', `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 3.***
