The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases and must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The list `s_list` contains `t` strings, each of which consists of lowercase Latin letters and has a length `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s_list` does not exceed 10^6.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a string in `s_list`. The exact nature of the results is not specified in the given information, but it is implied that the function processes each string in `s_list` and produces a corresponding output for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list`. It returns a list of results, where each result is based on the processing of a string in `s_list`.**
