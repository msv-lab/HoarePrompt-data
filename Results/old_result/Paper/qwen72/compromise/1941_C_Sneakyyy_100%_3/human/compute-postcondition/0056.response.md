Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is the new input string, `ans` is the number of times the substring 'map' or 'pie' appears in `a`, and `i` is the length of `a` minus 2.** 

The code snippet `a = input()` updates the value of `a` to a new input string. The other variables (`n`, `ans`, and `i`) remain unchanged, but `i` is now the length of the new input string minus 2.
