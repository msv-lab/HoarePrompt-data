Output State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that were considered as potential max segments, and now includes an additional segment which is `max_segment` with the end index `len(arr) - 1` appended to it, `max_sum` is -1.**

Explanation:
- `new_segment` remains an empty list.
- `max_segment` remains the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop.
- `segments_variants` now includes an additional segment, which is the concatenation of `max_segment` and the list containing the value `len(arr) - 1`.
- `max_sum` remains -1.
