To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `segment` and `segments_variants`. The loop will execute if `segments_variants` is not empty. Given the initial state, `segments_variants` must include at least one segment for the loop to start. The variable `segment` will take on the value of the first element in `segments_variants` during the first iteration.

State: **`new_segment` is an empty list, `max_segment` is the segment with the highest sum encountered during the loop, `segments_variants` is a list of segments that must have at least one segment, `max_sum` is -1, `total_max_segment` is `[-1]`, `segment` is the first segment in `segments_variants`**
