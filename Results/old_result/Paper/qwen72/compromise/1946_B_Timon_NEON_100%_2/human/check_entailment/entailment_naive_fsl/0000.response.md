Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is incomplete and does not fully implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Specifically, `func_3` is not implemented, and the overall logic to perform the operations and calculate the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations is missing. Here is a potential case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3 2
2 2 8
```

**Expected Output:**
```
96
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will not produce any output because `func_3` is not implemented and the main logic to handle the test cases is missing. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
