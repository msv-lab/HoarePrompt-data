### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` and we need to perform exactly `k` operations.
   - In each operation, we can select any contiguous subarray of `a` and insert the sum of this subarray anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations.
   - The final answer should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis:**
   - **func_1(number):** This function returns the number modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is a straightforward and correct implementation for the modulo operation.
   - **func_2(arr):** This function is intended to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and its indices. However, there are several issues with this function:
     - It initializes `new_segment` and `max_segment` as lists, but `new_segment` is only ever a single element or empty, which is inconsistent.
     - The logic for updating `max_segment` and `new_segment` is flawed. It does not correctly handle the case where the array has negative numbers.
     - The function appends `max_segment` and `new_segment` to `segments_variants` multiple times, which is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
     - The final loop to find the maximum segment is also flawed because it does not correctly handle the case where `total_max_segment` is initialized to \([-1]\).
   - **func_3(number, quantity):** This function is incomplete and does not perform any operations. It is supposed to calculate the final answer, but it is not implemented.

3. **Algorithmic Approach:**
   - To maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations, we should focus on the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is positive, we can repeatedly insert this sum to maximize the total sum.
   - If the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray is zero or negative, inserting it will not increase the sum, so we should just return the sum of the original array modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to use a more reliable method to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, such as Kadane's algorithm.
   - We then need to calculate the final sum after `k` operations, taking into account the modulo operation.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the provided functions, the program is incorrect. The logic in `func_2` is flawed and `func_3` is not implemented.

Correctness: **False**
