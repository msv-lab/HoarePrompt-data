### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an array `a` of `n` integers and need to perform `k` operations where each operation involves selecting a contiguous subarray, computing its sum, and inserting this sum anywhere in the array.
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the array after `k` operations and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function takes an integer `number` and returns the remainder when `number` is divided by \(10^9 + 7\). This is used to ensure the final result fits within the required modulo.
   - **func_2**: This function is supposed to find the segment of the array with the highest sum. It returns a list containing the sum of the segment, the starting index, and the ending index. If the array is empty or all elements are negative, it returns `[-1]`.
   - **func_3**: This function is not used in the provided code and does not contribute to the solution. It returns a list of `quantity` elements, each equal to `number`.

3. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2(a)` to find the segment with the highest sum.
   - If the segment with the highest sum is negative (indicated by `max_segment[0] == -1`), it sets the sum to 0.
   - It computes the final answer using the formula: `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]`.
   - Finally, it prints the result of `func_1(answer)`.

4. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - **func_2** is designed to find the segment with the highest sum, which is crucial for the problem. However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed:
     - It does not correctly handle the case where the array contains only negative numbers. The function should return the maximum sum of any subarray, which in the case of all negative numbers should be 0 (the sum of an empty subarray).
     - The function also does not correctly handle the case where the array is empty, which should also return 0.
   - **func_3** is not used and can be ignored.
   - The main logic in the program uses the formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` to compute the final answer. This formula is based on the idea that the maximum sum segment can be added `k` times, and the rest of the array remains unchanged. However, this formula is incorrect:
     - The correct approach should be to find the maximum sum of any subarray and then add this sum `k` times to the total sum of the array.
     - The formula `max_segment[0] * 2 ** k + sum(a) - max_segment[0]` incorrectly assumes that the maximum segment can be added in a way that doubles its contribution each time, which is not how the problem is defined.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic is flawed in both `func_2` and the main computation of the answer.
   - Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
