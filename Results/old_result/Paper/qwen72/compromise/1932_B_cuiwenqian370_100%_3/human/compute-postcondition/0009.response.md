Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is converted from the corresponding string in `data[index:index + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is 2, `T` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` converts the strings in the slice `data[index:index + n]` to integers and assigns them to the list `a`. The length of `a` remains `n`, and each integer in `a` is within the range 1 to 10^6 as specified in the initial state. The values of `n`, `data`, `index`, `T`, and `results` remain unchanged.
