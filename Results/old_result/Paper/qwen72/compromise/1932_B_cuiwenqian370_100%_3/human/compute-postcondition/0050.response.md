Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2, `last_year` is equal to `next_year`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `next_year` is updated to `((last_year + 1 + a[2] - 1) // a[2]) * a[2]`.
- The value of `last_year` remains equal to the previous `next_year`.
- The value of `i` is still 2.
- The list `a` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.
- The value of `_` is incremented by 1.
- The value of `T` must still be greater than `_ + 1`.
- The value of `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.
- The `results` list still includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`.
