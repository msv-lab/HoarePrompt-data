Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The value of `last_year` is updated to be equal to `next_year`.
- Since `next_year` was previously calculated as `((last_year + 1 + a[3] - 1) // a[3]) * a[3]`, `last_year` now holds this value.
- The value of `next_year` remains the same.
- All other variables (`a`, `n`, `i`, `results`, `_`, `T`, `index`) retain their previous values and conditions.
