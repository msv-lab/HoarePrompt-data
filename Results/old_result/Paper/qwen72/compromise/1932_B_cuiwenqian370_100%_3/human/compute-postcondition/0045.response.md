Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` integers starting from `data[index - n]` to `data[index - 1]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - n]`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is now equal to `a[0]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of the original `last_year` and the updated `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_ + 1`, `index` is incremented by `n + 1`.**

Explanation:
- `last_year` is updated to be equal to `a[0]`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
