Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is converted from the corresponding string in `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `2 + n`, `T` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The value of `index` is incremented by `n`, so the new value of `index` is `2 + n`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `data`, `T`, and `results`) remain unchanged.
