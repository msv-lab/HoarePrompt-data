The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the value `T`. The loop will execute again if `T` is greater than the current value of `_`. Since `_` is the loop variable and is incremented by 1 each time the loop runs, and at the end of the previous iteration, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` and `next_year` are equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, and `results` includes the string representation of `last_year`, we need to adjust the state for the next iteration.

At the start of the next iteration, `_` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `last_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `next_year` is equal to `((last_year + 1 + a[n-1] - 1) // a[n-1]) * a[n-1]`, `results` includes the string representation of `last_year`, `_` is incremented by 1, `T` must be greater than `_`**
