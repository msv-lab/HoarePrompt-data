Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[1])`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is converted from the corresponding string in `data[2:2 + n]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input, `index` is `2 + n`, `T` must be greater than 0, `results` is an empty list, `last_year` is equal to `a[0]`.** 

The variable `last_year` is now assigned the value of the first element in the list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
