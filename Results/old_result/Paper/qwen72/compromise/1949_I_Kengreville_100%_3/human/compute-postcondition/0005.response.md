Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` of length `n`.**

The code `coef = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `coef` to a list of `None` of length `n`, but since `coef` was already a list of `None` of length `n`, the state of `coef` remains unchanged. All other variables retain their initial states.
