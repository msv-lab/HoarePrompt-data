Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the construction of polygons with sides other than 4. The function `func_1` only counts the number of times a stick length can form a square (4-sided polygon) by dividing the frequency of each stick length by 4. However, the problem description allows for the construction of any regular polygon (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.). 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The correct output should be 2, as we can form two equilateral triangles (3-sided polygons) with the given sticks. However, the provided program will output 1, as it only counts the number of squares that can be formed. This makes the program incorrect for the given problem description.
