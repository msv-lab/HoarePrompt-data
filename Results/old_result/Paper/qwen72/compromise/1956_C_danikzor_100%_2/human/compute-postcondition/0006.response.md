Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` from user input and prints a tuple containing the values `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` and `2 * n`. It then iterates from 1 to `n`, printing two lines for each iteration. Each line starts with the numbers 1 and 2, followed by the current iteration value `i`, and then the numbers from `n` down to 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged after the function execution. **
