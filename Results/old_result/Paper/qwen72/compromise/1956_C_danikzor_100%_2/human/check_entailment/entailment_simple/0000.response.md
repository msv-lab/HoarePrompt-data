### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()` to handle each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` reads the integer `n` for the current test case.
   - It calculates and prints the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements and the number of operations (which is `2 * n`).

3. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum sum is `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6`.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `n` natural numbers and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers squared, which is correct for the problem's constraints.

4. **Operations Output**:
   - The function then iterates `n` times, performing two operations for each row `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - The first operation is of type 1, which sets the `i`-th row to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - The second operation is of type 2, which sets the `i`-th column to the permutation `[n, n-1, ..., 1]`.
   - This ensures that each element in the matrix is set to a value from 1 to `n`, maximizing the sum.

5. **Correctness of Operations**:
   - The operations are performed in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values.
   - The number of operations is `2 * n`, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and constraints. It calculates the maximum sum and performs the operations to achieve it within the allowed number of operations.

**Correctness: True**
