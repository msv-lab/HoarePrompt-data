### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - Two types of operations are allowed: Type 1 (row permutation) and Type 2 (column permutation).
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum sum using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum is achieved by filling the matrix with the highest possible values, which are the integers from 1 to \( n \) in each row and column.
   - The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since each row and each column can be filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), the sum of each row and each column will be \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The total sum of the matrix is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It prints the maximum sum \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) and the number of operations \( 2n \).
   - It then performs \( 2n \) operations:
     - For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 1 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).
     - For each column \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs a Type 2 operation using the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \).

4. **Verification of Maximum Sum:**
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) is used to calculate the maximum sum.
   - This formula is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers and the fact that each element in the matrix will be the sum of the row and column permutations.
   - For \( n = 1 \), the sum is \( 1 \).
   - For \( n = 2 \), the sum is \( 7 \).
   - For \( n = 3 \), the sum is \( 20 \).
   - These values match the expected maximum sums for the given problem.

5. **Verification of Operations:**
   - The program ensures that no more than \( 2n \) operations are performed.
   - Each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), which is a valid permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

### Challenging the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the maximum sum formula and the number of operations.
- However, the formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)(4n - 1)}{6} \) is not the correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct formula should be \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).

### Correct Maximum Sum Formula:
- The correct formula for the maximum sum of the matrix is \( \frac{n^2(n + 1)}{2} \).
- This formula is derived from the fact that each row and each column will be filled with the permutation \( [n, n-1, \ldots, 1] \), and there are \( n \) such rows and columns.

### Corrected Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    max_sum = n * (n + 1) * n // 2
    print(max_sum, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program uses the incorrect formula for the maximum sum.
- The operations are correctly performed and ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

Final: **False**
