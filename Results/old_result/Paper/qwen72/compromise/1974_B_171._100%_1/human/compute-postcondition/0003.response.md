The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `len_unique`. For the loop to execute, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` is a sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`, `char_map` is an empty dictionary, `len_unique` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
