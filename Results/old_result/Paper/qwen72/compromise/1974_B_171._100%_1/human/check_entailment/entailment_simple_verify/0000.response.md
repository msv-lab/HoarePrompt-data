Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` and the length of the encoded string `n` for each test case.
   - It also correctly extracts the encoded string `b` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Unique Characters**:
     - The program constructs `unique_chars` by taking the set of characters from the encoded string `b` and sorting them. This ensures that `unique_chars` contains all distinct characters in alphabetical order, which matches the problem description.
   - **Character Mapping**:
     - The program creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its symmetric character. For example, if `unique_chars` is `['a', 'b', 'c']`, then `char_map` will be `{'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}`.
     - This mapping is correct and matches the encoding process described in the problem.
   - **Decoding**:
     - The program decodes the string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding value in `char_map`.
     - The `decoded` string is constructed using a generator expression inside the `join` method, which is efficient and correct.

3. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the decoded string for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Character String**:
     - If the encoded string has only one character, the `unique_chars` list will have a single character, and the mapping will be a self-mapping. The program correctly handles this case.
   - **Strings with Repeated Characters**:
     - The program correctly handles strings with repeated characters by mapping each character to its symmetric character in the `unique_chars` list.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient in terms of both time and space complexity. The set and sort operations are O(n log n), and the dictionary creation and decoding are O(n), where n is the length of the encoded string.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output for the given inputs.

Final: **True**
