The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and it is now the integer input provided by the user, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0**
