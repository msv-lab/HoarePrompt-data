Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Trimming the List**: The program trims the list `a` by removing leading and trailing zeros. This step is correct because it ensures that the list `a` only contains the segment with chips and no free cells at the ends.

2. **Counting Zeros**: The program then counts the number of zeros in the trimmed list `a` and prints this count as the result. However, this approach is incorrect because the number of zeros in the trimmed list does not necessarily correspond to the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to find the minimum number of moves required to move all chips into a single contiguous block. The optimal strategy is to move all chips to the median position of the chips. This is because moving to the median minimizes the total distance traveled by all chips.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the positions of the chips
        chip_positions = [i for i in range(n) if a[i] == 1]
        
        # Find the median position of the chips
        median_position = chip_positions[len(chip_positions) // 2]
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of moves
        res = sum(abs(median_position - pos) for pos in chip_positions)
        
        print(res)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Finding Chip Positions**: The program first finds the positions of all chips in the list `a`.
2. **Median Position**: It then calculates the median position of these chips. The median is chosen because it minimizes the sum of absolute differences.
3. **Calculate Moves**: Finally, it calculates the total number of moves required to move all chips to the median position.

This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is correctly computed for each test case.
