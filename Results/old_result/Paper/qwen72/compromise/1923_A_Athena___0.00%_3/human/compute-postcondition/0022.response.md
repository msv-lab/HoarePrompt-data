Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, and `a` must have at least one element, `res` is 1, and the current element `a[i]` is 0.**

The value of `res` is incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
