The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, and `_` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers provided by the user with all leading zeros removed and all trailing zeros removed, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and `res` is the number of zeros in the list `a`.**
