### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is necessary to find the median.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula correctly finds the median index for both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - For an odd-length array, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2`, which is the middle index.
   - For an even-length array, `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`, which is the first of the two middle indices.

4. **Operation Counting:**
   - The function initializes `res` to 0, which will store the number of operations required to increase the median.
   - It then iterates from the median index `mdx` to the end of the array.
   - For each element from `mdx` to `n-1`, if the element is equal to `a[mdx]`, it increments `res`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `res` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations:**
  - The current logic only counts the number of elements from the median index to the end of the array that are equal to the median. This does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
  - To increase the median, we need to find the smallest number greater than the current median and count the operations required to make the median equal to that number.

### Correct Logic:
- **For an odd-length array:**
  - The median is the middle element. We need to find the smallest element greater than the current median and count the operations required to make the median equal to that element.
- **For an even-length array:**
  - The median is the average of the two middle elements. We need to find the smallest element greater than the second middle element and count the operations required to make the median equal to that element.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            current_median = a[mdx]
            next_greater = current_median + 1
            while mdx < n and a[mdx] < next_greater:
                next_greater += 1
            operations = next_greater - current_median
            print(operations)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **For an odd-length array:**
  - `mdx` is the middle index.
  - `current_median` is the value at the middle index.
  - `next_greater` is the smallest number greater than `current_median`.
  - The loop increments `next_greater` until it finds a number that is not present in the array from `mdx` to `n-1`.
  - The number of operations required is `next_greater - current_median`.

- **For an even-length array:**
  - `mdx` is the second middle index.
  - The logic is the same as for the odd-length array, but it ensures that the median is increased to the smallest number greater than the second middle element.

### Correctness:
- The original program does not correctly determine the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
- The corrected program addresses this issue and should provide the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
