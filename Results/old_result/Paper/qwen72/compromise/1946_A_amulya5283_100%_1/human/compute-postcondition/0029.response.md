The given Python code snippet is:
```
print(1)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an input integer minus 3.
   - `n` is the length of the sorted list `a`.
   - `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.
   - If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`.
   - If `n` is greater than 1:
     - `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
     - `i` is `n - 1`.
     - `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

2. **Code Execution:**
   - The `print` statement is `print(1)`.
   - This statement simply prints the integer `1`.

### Explanation:
- The `print(1)` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state.
- It will always print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, `i`, or `res`.

### Final Output:
Output: **1**
