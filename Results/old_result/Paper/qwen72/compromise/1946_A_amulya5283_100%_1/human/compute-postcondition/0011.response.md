To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is:

```python
for i in range(mdx, n):
```

The variables in the loop head are `i`, `mdx`, and `n`. The loop will execute if the range `range(mdx, n)` is not empty. This means that `mdx` must be less than `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer minus 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user
- `n` is not equal to 1
- `res` is 0
- `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`

Let's break down the conditions:

1. **`mdx` Calculation**:
   - `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`
   - This formula ensures that `mdx` is the middle index of the list `a` if `n` is odd, or the index just before the middle if `n` is even.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop will execute if `mdx < n`.

Given the initial state, we need to ensure that `mdx` is less than `n` for the loop to execute. Let's verify this:

- If `n` is odd, `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` is 1. Therefore, `mdx = (n // 2) + 1 - 1 = n // 2`.
- If `n` is even, `n // 2` is the integer division of `n` by 2, and `n % 2` is 0. Therefore, `mdx = (n // 2) + 0 - 1 = n // 2 - 1`.

In both cases, `mdx` is less than `n` as long as `n` is greater than 1, which is already given in the state.

Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, and `i` will start from `mdx` and iterate up to `n-1`.

State: **`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `res` is 0, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx`**
