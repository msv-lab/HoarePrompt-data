The value of `t` is decremented by 1. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged. If `n` is 1, `mdx`, `i`, and `res` are not modified. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
