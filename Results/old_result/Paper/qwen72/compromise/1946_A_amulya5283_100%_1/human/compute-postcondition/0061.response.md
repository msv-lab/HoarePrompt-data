The value of `res` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `res` is either 1 or 2, depending on whether the element at index `mdx` in `a` is equal to the element at index `i` in `a`. Therefore, the new value of `res` will be 2 or 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 4 and `t` must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2`, `res` is either 2 or 3.**
