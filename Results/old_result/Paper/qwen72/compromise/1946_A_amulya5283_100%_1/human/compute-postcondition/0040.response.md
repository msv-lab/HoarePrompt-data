Output State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a` and must be at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is 2 or 3 depending on the previous iteration's condition if `a[mdx] == a[i]`. Otherwise, `res` is 1 or 2 depending on the previous iteration's condition.**

Explanation:
- The value of `res` is incremented by 1.
- If `a[mdx] == a[i]` in the previous iteration, `res` was 1 or 2, so now `res` is 2 or 3.
- If `a[mdx] != a[i]` in the previous iteration, `res` was 0 or 1, so now `res` is 1 or 2.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `mdx`, and `i` remain unchanged.
