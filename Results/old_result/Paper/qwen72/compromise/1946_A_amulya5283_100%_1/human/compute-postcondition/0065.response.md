Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer minus 4 and must be greater than -1, `n` is the new input integer, and `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`. Additionally, if `n` is greater than 1, `i` is set to `n` and `n` must be greater than `mdx`.***
