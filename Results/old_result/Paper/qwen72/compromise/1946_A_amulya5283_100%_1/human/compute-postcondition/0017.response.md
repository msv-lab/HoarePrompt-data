Postcondition: ***`t` is an input integer minus 1, `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is equal to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `n` must be greater than `mdx + 1`. If `a[mdx]` is equal to `a[i]`, `res` is 1 or 2 based on the previous condition. Otherwise, `res` remains 0 or 1 based on the previous condition.***
