The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an input integer minus 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3 and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a`, and `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user. If `n` is 1, there are no changes to `mdx`, `i`, or `res`. If `n` is greater than 1, `mdx` is set to `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is set to `n - 1`, and `res` is the number of elements in `a` from index `mdx` to `n - 1` that are equal to `a[mdx]`.**
