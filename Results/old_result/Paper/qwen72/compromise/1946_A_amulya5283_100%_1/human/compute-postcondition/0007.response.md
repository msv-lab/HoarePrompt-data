Let's analyze the given initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `t` is an input integer minus 1.
- `n` is an input integer and its current value is 1.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(1)
```

### Analysis:
- The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` do not affect the output of this specific print statement because the statement does not reference any of these variables.

### Output:
The code prints the integer `1`.
Output: **1**
