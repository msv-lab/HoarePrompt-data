The only objects in the loop head are variables `i`, `mdx`, and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`, with `i` starting from `mdx + 1` and the loop continuing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `mdx + 1`, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, and `n` is the length of the sorted list `a` and must be at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `n` must still be greater than the new value of `i`.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is `mdx + 2`.
- `n` must be greater than `mdx + 2` for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an input integer minus 3, `n` is the length of the sorted list `a` and must be at least 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers input by the user, `mdx` is `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`, `i` is `mdx + 2`, `res` is 1 or 2 depending on the previous iteration's condition if `a[mdx] == a[i]`. Otherwise, `res` remains 0 or 1 depending on the previous iteration's condition.**
