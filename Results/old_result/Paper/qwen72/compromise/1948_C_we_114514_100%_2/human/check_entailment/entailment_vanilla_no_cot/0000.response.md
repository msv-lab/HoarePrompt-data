Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from (1, 1).
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (since n is even, `half_n = n // 2`).
   - For each cell in the first row, it checks if the robot can get stuck in a loop or be blocked from reaching the end.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot can move to the next cell in the first row and then be blocked by the arrows in the second row.
   - If the robot can move to the last cell in the first row and then to the last cell in the second row, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the robot gets stuck or blocked, it returns 'No'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two rows of arrows.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) based on the given constraints and problem description. The program handles multiple test cases and valid inputs as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
