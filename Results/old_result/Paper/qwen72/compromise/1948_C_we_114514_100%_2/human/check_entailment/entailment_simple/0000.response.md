### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves left, right, up, or down, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right.
   - The robot cannot move outside the grid or skip a move.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the number of columns), `row1` (the first row of arrows), and `row2` (the second row of arrows).
   - The function checks if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - The loop iterates over the first half of the columns (up to `half_n - 1`), checking if there is a condition where the robot is forced to move left in a way that prevents it from reaching the end.
   - If the loop finds such a condition, it returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks the last column and the second-to-last column to ensure the robot can move to the final cell (2, n).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and calls `func_1` with these parameters.
   - The results of each test case are stored in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks for conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell (2, n). Specifically, it ensures that the robot is not forced to move left in a way that would block its path.
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes each test case, storing the results and printing them at the end.
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and covers all necessary conditions to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.
   - The input handling in `func_2` is also correct and follows the problem's constraints.
