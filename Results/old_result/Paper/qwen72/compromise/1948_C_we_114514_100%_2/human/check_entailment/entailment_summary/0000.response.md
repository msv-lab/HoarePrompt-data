### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and needs to reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot moves every second in one of four directions: left, right, up, or down.
   - After moving, the robot follows the direction of the arrow in the cell it lands in.
   - The grid is 2 rows by n columns, and n is always even.
   - The arrows in the grid are represented by '<' (left) and '>' (right).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach cell (2, n) from (1, 1).
   - It divides the grid into two halves and checks for blocking conditions:
     - For each cell in the first half (from column 1 to column n-2), it checks if the robot is blocked by '<' characters in `row1` and `row2`.
     - Specifically, it checks if `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<'.
     - It also checks if the last cell in `row1` (i.e., `row1[n - 1]`) is '<' and the second-to-last cell in `row2` (i.e., `row2[n - 2]`) is '<'.
   - If any of these conditions are met, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and calls `func_1` to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).
   - It collects the results of all test cases and prints them one per line.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to ensure that the robot can move to the right and eventually reach the last column.
   - The function checks for blocking conditions that would prevent the robot from moving to the next column or reaching the last column.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each one, collecting and printing the results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 2.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the robot can move to the right and not get stuck in a loop or blocked by '<' characters.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach cell (2, n) from (1, 1) based on the given problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output.

**Correctness: **True****
