The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is an iterator over the range defined by `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, as this will ensure that the range has at least one value to iterate over. The other variables (`n`, `row1`, `row2`, and `results`) are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
