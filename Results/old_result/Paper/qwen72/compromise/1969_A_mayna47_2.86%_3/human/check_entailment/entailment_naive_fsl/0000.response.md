Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where the minimum number of invitations required is greater than 3. For example, consider the input:

```
1
6
2 3 4 5 6 1
```

In this case, the friends form a cycle of length 6. To ensure at least 2 friends come to the party, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends. However, the program will incorrectly print 3, even though it should print 4 to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party. The logic in the program only checks for cycles of length 3 (using `v[v[v[i]]] == i`), but it does not handle cycles of other lengths.
