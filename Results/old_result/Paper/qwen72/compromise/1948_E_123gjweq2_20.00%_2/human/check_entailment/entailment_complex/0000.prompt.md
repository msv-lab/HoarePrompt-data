Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers, n and k . There is a graph on n vertices, numbered
from 1 to n , which initially has no edges.

You have to assign each vertex an integer; let a_i be the integer on the
vertex i . All a_i should be distinct integers from 1 to n .

After assigning integers, for every pair of vertices (i, j) , you add an edge
between them if |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k .

Your goal is to create a graph which can be partitioned into the minimum
possible (for the given values of n and k ) number of cliques. Each vertex of
the graph should belong to exactly one clique. Recall that a clique is a set
of vertices such that every pair of vertices in it are connected with an edge.

Since BledDest hasn't really brushed his programming skills up, he can't solve
the problem "given a graph, partition it into the minimum number of cliques".
So we also ask you to print the partition itself.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1600 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of one line containing two integers n and k (2 \le n
\le 40 ; 1 \le k \le 2n ).

Output

For each test case, print three lines:

  * the first line should contain n distinct integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — the values you assign to the vertices; 
  * the second line should contain one integer q (1 \le q \le n ) — the number of cliques you partition the graph into; 
  * the third line should contain n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1 \le c_i \le q ) — the partition of the graph into cliques. Where two vertices u and v are in the same clique if c_u = c_v . 

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

# Annotated Functions:
from math import ceil

testcases = range(int(input()))
for case in testcases:
    (n, k) = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
    func_1(n, k)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n, `cliques` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`, `arr` is a list where the first `k` elements are 1, the next `k` elements are 2, and so on, up to the last segment which will be filled with the value `cliques`, `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: - The output will be a sequence of integers where the first `k` elements are 1, the next `k` elements are 2, and so on, up to the last segment which will be filled with the value `cliques`.
    #
    #Output:
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n / k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 0 0 0 ... 0 (where the sequence contains `n` zeros)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`. The function then creates a list `arr` of length `n` where the first `k` elements are 1, the next `k` elements are 2, and so on, up to the last segment which will be filled with the value `cliques`. It prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are non-negative integers such that left <= right, and clique is a positive integer.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + i] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: `left` and `right` remain the same, `clique` remains the same, `small_element` remains the same, `big_element` remains the same, `mid` remains the same, `not_mid` remains the same, `arr[left:mid]` is updated to `[small_element, small_element + 1, ..., small_element + (mid - 1)]`, and `cliquess[left:mid]` is updated to `[clique, clique, ..., clique]`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` and `right` remain the same, `clique` remains the same, `small_element` remains the same, `big_element` remains the same, `mid` remains the same, `not_mid` remains the same, `arr[left:mid]` is updated to `[small_element, small_element + 1, ..., small_element + (mid - 1)]`, and `arr[left + mid:left + mid + not_mid]` is updated to `[big_element - 0, big_element - 1, ..., big_element - (not_mid - 1)]`, and `cliquess[left:mid]` is updated to `[clique, clique, ..., clique]`, and `cliquess[left + mid:left + mid + not_mid]` is updated to `[clique, clique, ..., clique]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` ≤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. It updates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that `arr[left:right + 1]` is filled with a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern: the first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. The `cliquess` list is updated to contain the value `clique` for all indices from `left` to `right + 1`. The function does not return any value.
