The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `mid`. If `mid` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The initial state provided does not directly affect the loop's execution, but it does influence the value of `mid`.

Given:
- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`
- `clique` is a positive integer (though not used in the loop head)
- `small_element` is equal to `left + 1`
- `big_element` is equal to `right + 1`
- `mid` is equal to `(right + 1) - (left + 1) // 2`
- `not_mid` is equal to `right - left + 1 - mid`

To ensure the loop executes, `mid` must be greater than 0. The value of `mid` is derived from `left` and `right`, so we need to ensure that the calculation of `mid` results in a positive integer.

Let's break down the calculation of `mid`:
- `mid` = `(right + 1) - (left + 1) // 2`
- Simplifying, `mid` = `right + 1 - (left + 1) // 2`

For `mid` to be greater than 0:
- `right + 1 - (left + 1) // 2 > 0`
- `right + 1 > (left + 1) // 2`

Since `left` and `right` are non-negative integers and `left` <= `right`, the above condition will be satisfied if `right` is at least 0 and `left` is at most `right`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `mid` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is equal to `left + 1`, `big_element` is equal to `right + 1`, `mid` is greater than 0, `not_mid` is equal to `right - left + 1 - mid`, `i` is 0**
