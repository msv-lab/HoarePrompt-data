    #State: `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 40 and 1 <= k <= 2n, `cliques` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`, `arr` is a list where the first `k` elements are 1, the next `k` elements are 2, and so on, up to the last segment which will be filled with the value `cliques`, `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.

    #Output:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where `2 <= n <= 40` and `1 <= k <= 2n`. It calculates the number of cliques as the smallest integer greater than or equal to `n / k`. The function then creates a list `arr` of length `n` where the first `k` elements are 1, the next `k` elements are 2, and so on, up to the last segment which will be filled with the value `cliques`. It prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and a list `cliquess` of `n` zeros. The function does not return any value.

    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts three parameters: `left`, `right`, and `clique`, where `left` and `right` are non-negative integers with `left` â‰¤ `right`, and `clique` is a positive integer. It updates two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, such that `arr[left:right + 1]` is filled with a sequence of integers starting from `left + 1` to `right + 1` in a specific pattern: the first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. The `cliquess` list is updated to contain the value `clique` for all indices from `left` to `right + 1`. The function does not return any value.
