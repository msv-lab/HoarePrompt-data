The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `N`. For the loop to execute, `N` must be at least 0, and `i` should start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is assigned the value of an input integer.
- `nums` is a list of integers read from the input, with `-1` appended to the end.
- `s` is 0.
- `e` is 0.
- `num` is the first integer in the list `nums`.
- `arr` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `N` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `i` should start at 0.

State: **`N` must be greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 0**
