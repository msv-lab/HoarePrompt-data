Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *The variable `N` remains unchanged. The list `nums` remains unchanged. The variable `s` is equal to `N`. The variable `e` remains unchanged. The variable `num` is equal to `-1`. The list `arr` contains tuples of the form `(1 + start_index, end_index, value)` for each contiguous segment of the same value in `nums`, where `start_index` is the starting index of the segment, `end_index` is the index just after the segment, and `value` is the value of the segment. The variable `LA` is equal to the length of `arr` minus 1. If `ppp` is equal to 23, then `ppp` remains equal to 23.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    l, r = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if tc > 5:
        if ppp == 23:
            print(l, r)
        continue
    eli = bisect_left(arr, (l, 0, 0))
    s, e, _ = arr[min(eli, LA)]
    if s > l:
        if s == 1:
            print(-1, -1)
        else:
            print(s - 1, s)
    elif e >= r:
        print(-1, -1)
    elif e < N:
        print(s, e + 1)
    else:
        print(-1, -1)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
