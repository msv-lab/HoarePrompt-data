Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by first compressing the array `nums` into a list of tuples `arr`, where each tuple contains the start index, end index, and value of a contiguous segment of the same value. This is a good approach for efficiently handling the queries.

However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Global `ppp` Variable**: The `ppp` variable, which is used to track the current test case, is not defined within the scope of `func_1()`. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

2. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The logic for handling queries is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for checking if a pair of different elements exists within the query range are not correctly implemented. The program uses `bisect_left` to find the segment that starts at or after the query's `l` value, but it does not correctly handle the case where the segment extends beyond the `r` value.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well. For example, if the entire range `[l, r]` consists of the same element, the program should return `(-1, -1)`, but it may return incorrect indices.

4. **Redundant Code**: The condition `if tc > 5:` and the special case `if ppp == 23:` are unnecessary and can be removed. They do not contribute to the correctness of the solution and may introduce bugs.

5. **Incorrect Output for Some Queries**: The logic for printing the indices is incorrect. For example, the condition `if s > l:` and `if e >= r:` do not correctly determine if a pair of different elements exists within the query range.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
