### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying a flaw in the program. Let's break down the issues and validate the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - This part is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends a `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle edge cases.
   - It then processes the array to create a list `arr` of tuples `(s, e, num)` where `s` and `e` are the start and end indices of contiguous segments of the same value `num`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if a valid pair of indices `i` and `j` can be found such that `a_i != a_j`.

4. **Flawed Logic:**
   - The program's logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` is flawed. Specifically, the conditions for checking if a valid pair exists are not comprehensive enough.
   - The condition `if s > l` is used to check if the start of the segment is greater than `l`. If so, it prints `s - 1, s`, which is incorrect because it assumes that the previous segment is different, which may not always be true.
   - The condition `elif e >= r` is used to check if the end of the segment is greater than or equal to `r`. If so, it prints `-1, -1`, which is also incorrect because it does not consider the possibility of a different segment ending before `r`.

5. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - For the query `(1, 3)` in the input:
     ```
     1
     5
     1 1 2 1 1
     3
     1 5
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - The array `nums` is `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, -1]`.
   - The list `arr` will be `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 3, 2), (4, 5, 1)]`.
   - For the query `(1, 3)`, `bisect_left` will return `0` (the first segment).
   - The program then checks `if s > l`, which is `False` because `s = 1` and `l = 1`.
   - It then checks `elif e >= r`, which is `True` because `e = 2` and `r = 3`.
   - Therefore, it prints `-1, -1`, which is incorrect because `a_1 = 1` and `a_3 = 2` are different.

### Corrected Logic:
To correctly handle the queries, the program should:
- Find the segment that starts at or after `l` using `bisect_left`.
- Check if the segment ends before `r` and if the next segment starts within `r`.
- If the segment ends before `r` and the next segment starts within `r`, return the indices of the current segment's end and the next segment's start.
- If no such segments are found, return `-1, -1`.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the program. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases, particularly the logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` such that `a_i != a_j` within the given query range.

Final: **False**
