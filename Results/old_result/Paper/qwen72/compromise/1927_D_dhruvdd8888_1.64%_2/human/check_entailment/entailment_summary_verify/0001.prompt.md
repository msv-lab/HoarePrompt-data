You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a list of integers `nums` and a series of queries `q`. For each query `[l, r]`, it identifies the boundaries of the contiguous segments in `nums` that contain the same value and returns a pair of indices that represent the boundaries of the segment containing the queried range. If the queried range does not fit within any segment, it returns `(-1, -1)`. The function handles multiple test cases, where each test case includes a list `nums` and a set of queries `q`. The input list `nums` and the number of elements `N` remain unchanged throughout the function execution. The function does not return a sum of elements but rather the boundaries of segments.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It appends `-1` to the array `nums` to handle edge cases, which is a common technique to avoid index out of bounds errors.

2. **Array Compression**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and compresses it into a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple represents a segment of the array with the same value.
   - Each tuple in `arr` contains `(start, end, value)` where `start` and `end` are the indices of the segment, and `value` is the value of the elements in that segment.
   - This compression helps in efficiently handling the queries by reducing the number of elements to check.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after the query start index `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if there is a valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i \ne a_j` within the query range `[l, r]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous segment can provide a valid pair.
   - If the segment ends before `r`, it checks if the next segment can provide a valid pair.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no valid pair exists.

5. **Debugging Statements**:
   - The program includes some debugging statements that print the array and query details if `ppp == 23` and `tc > 5`. These statements are not part of the actual logic and can be ignored for correctness evaluation.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is called inside a loop for each test case, but the function itself reads input, which can lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not properly managed.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.readline` inside `func_1` can cause issues if the input is not read in the correct order.
   - The program does not handle the case where the segment ends exactly at `r` and the next segment does not exist.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Input Management**: The program reads input inside `func_1`, which can cause issues if the input is not read in the correct order. This is a significant flaw.
- **Segment Handling**: The program correctly compresses the array and uses binary search to find segments, but it does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when the segment ends exactly at `r`.
- **Output**: The program does not always produce the correct output for all queries due to the issues mentioned above.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program has issues with input management and handling edge cases, which can lead to incorrect results for some queries.
