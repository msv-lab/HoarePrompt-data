### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `tc` and then iterates over each test case using the variable `ppp`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Reading Input**:
     - The function reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums` itself.
     - It also reads the number of queries and then processes each query.
   - **Segment Identification**:
     - The function identifies contiguous segments of the same value in `nums` and stores them in the list `arr` as tuples `(1 + start_index, end_index, value)`.
     - The list `arr` is constructed correctly, and the segments are identified based on the condition `nums[i] != num`.
   - **Query Processing**:
     - For each query `[l, r]`, the function uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment boundaries are greater than or equal to `l`.
     - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if a valid pair of indices exists within the query range.
     - If `s > l`, it checks if `s == 1` and prints `(-1, -1)` if true, otherwise it prints `(s - 1, s)`.
     - If `e >= r`, it prints `(-1, -1)`.
     - If `e < N`, it prints `(s, e + 1)`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

3. **Edge Cases and Conditions**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the queried range does not fit within any segment.
   - The function also handles the case where the segment starts at index 1, ensuring that it prints `(-1, -1)` if no valid pair exists.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the indices `i` and `j` for each query, or `(-1, -1)` if no such pair exists.
   - The output format matches the problem description.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The function `func_1` is called without passing the required parameters `a`, `n`, and `q` as described in the problem statement. This is a critical issue because the function expects these parameters to be passed.
   - The function `func_1` reads input directly using `sys.stdin.readline`, which is not a standard way to handle input in a function. Typically, input should be passed as parameters to the function.
   - The variable `tc` is used to control the number of test cases, but it is not passed to `func_1` and is not used within the function. This is a logical inconsistency.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues with the function call and input handling, the program is not correct as it stands. The function `func_1` should be called with the appropriate parameters, and input should be passed to the function rather than being read directly within it.

Correctness: **False**
