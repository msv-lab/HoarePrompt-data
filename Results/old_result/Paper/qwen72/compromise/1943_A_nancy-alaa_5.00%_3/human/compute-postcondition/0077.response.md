The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `first` is False, `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`, `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.**
