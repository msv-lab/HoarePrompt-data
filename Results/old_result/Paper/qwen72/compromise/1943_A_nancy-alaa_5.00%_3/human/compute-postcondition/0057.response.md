Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `first` is True.
- `mpp` remains unchanged.
- If `i` is not in `mpp.keys()`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Given the `print(i)` statement, we need to determine the value of `i` that will be printed. According to the initial state, `i` is explicitly set to 1. The conditions about `n`, `first`, and `mpp` do not affect the value of `i` in this specific print statement.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1**
