Based on the initial state provided:

- `i` is explicitly set to 1.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `first` is set to False.
- `mpp` is a Counter object containing the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
- `arr` is a list of integers input by the user.
- If `i` is not in the keys of `mpp`, the most internal loop or if statement is broken.

The `print(i)` statement will print the value of `i`.

Since `i` is explicitly set to 1, the value of `i` is known and will be printed as 1.

Output: **1**
