Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the array `a` contains all elements from `0` to `n-1` exactly once. In such a case, the MEX of the final array `c` should be `n` because all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `c`. However, the program will incorrectly output `n-1` because it breaks the loop as soon as it finds an element that is not in `mpp` or an element that appears only once and `first` is `True`.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
5
0 1 2 3 4
```

Expected output:
```
5
```

Actual output:
```
4
```
