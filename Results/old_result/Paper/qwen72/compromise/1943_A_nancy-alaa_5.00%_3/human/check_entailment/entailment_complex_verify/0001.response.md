Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and removing them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob just removes the picked element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to avoid including the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - Both players will focus on the smallest integers first, as they are the most critical for determining the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It iterates through the range of possible values (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The first condition checks if the current integer `i` is not in the `Counter` keys. If it is not, it means `i` is the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The second condition checks if `i` appears exactly once in the array and if it is Alice's turn (`first` is `True`). If both conditions are met, it means Alice can pick this element to maximize the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The third condition sets `first` to `True` when `i` appears exactly once, indicating that Alice will pick this element on her next turn.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX by checking the smallest integer that is not in the array.
   - However, the logic for handling the optimal strategy is flawed. The program does not correctly simulate the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - The variable `first` is used to indicate Alice's turn, but it does not accurately reflect the turn sequence. Alice and Bob take turns, and the program should account for this.
   - The program assumes that if a number appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, it is Alice's turn and she will pick that number. This is not necessarily correct because Bob can also pick a number that appears exactly once on his turn, which would prevent Alice from picking it.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - However, it does not handle the turn sequence correctly, which can lead to incorrect results in more complex scenarios.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case: `arr = [0, 0, 1, 1]`
     - The program will print `2` because it correctly identifies that `0` and `1` are both in the array, and `2` is the smallest integer not in the array.
   - For the second test case: `arr = [0, 1, 2, 3]`
     - The program will print `1` because it incorrectly assumes that Alice will pick `1` on her turn, which is not necessarily true. Bob can pick `0` first, and then Alice can pick `1`, leading to a MEX of `2`.
   - For the third test case: `arr = [1, 1]`
     - The program will print `0` because it correctly identifies that `0` is the smallest integer not in the array.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly simulate the turn sequence between Alice and Bob.
   - The logic for determining the MEX based on the turn sequence is flawed, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Final: **False**
