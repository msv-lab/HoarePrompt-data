Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem by determining the optimal MEX score for the game described. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually, which is in line with the problem's input format.

2. **Counter Usage**: The program uses a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`. This helps in efficiently checking the presence and frequency of elements.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Goal**: Maximize the MEX of the array `c`.
   - **Bob's Goal**: Minimize the MEX of the array `c`.

   The program iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1` and checks for the smallest integer `i` that is not in `mpp` (the counter of elements in `arr`). This is the MEX of the array `c` if the game ends without any single occurrences being picked.

   If `i` is found in `mpp` and its count is 1, the program checks if it's Alice's turn (`first` is `True`). If it is, Alice will pick this element, and the MEX will be `i + 1` (since `i` will be in `c` and the next smallest integer will be `i + 1`).

4. **Termination**:
   - If `i` is not in `mpp`, it means `i` is the smallest integer not in the array `arr`, and thus the MEX of `c` is `i`.
   - If `i` is in `mpp` and its count is 1, and it's Alice's turn, the MEX of `c` will be `i + 1` because Alice will pick this element, and `i` will be in `c`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the MEX for each test case, which is the correct output format.

The logic and implementation are consistent with the problem's requirements and constraints, ensuring that both players play optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
