Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` and removing them.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c`, while Bob just removes the picked element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` when the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX, and Bob aims to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to ensure that the smallest possible integers are not included in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob wants to ensure that the smallest possible integers are included in `c` to minimize the MEX.
   - Both players will focus on the smallest integers first, as they are the most critical for determining the MEX.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `arr`.
   - It iterates through the range of possible values (from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The first condition checks if the current integer `i` is not in the `Counter` keys. If it is not, it means `i` is the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The second condition checks if `i` appears exactly once in the array and if it is Alice's turn (`first` is `True`). If both conditions are met, it means Alice can pick this element to maximize the MEX, and the program prints `i` and breaks the loop.
   - The third condition sets `first` to `True` when `i` appears exactly once, indicating that Alice will pick this element on her next turn.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the MEX by checking the smallest integer that is not in the array.
   - However, the logic for handling the case where `i` appears exactly once is flawed. The variable `first` is used to track whether Alice has picked an element that appears exactly once, but it does not correctly simulate the turns of the game.
   - The program assumes that if `i` appears exactly once and `first` is `True`, then Alice will pick this element. This is not always correct because Bob can also pick this element on his turn, and the game's optimal strategy should consider both players' actions.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the elements are in a specific order that affects the MEX, especially when both players are playing optimally.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `4 0 0 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `2` because `0` and `1` are both in the array, and the smallest integer not in the array is `2`.
   - For the input `4 0 1 2 3`, the program outputs `1` because `0` is in the array, and the smallest integer not in the array that appears exactly once is `1`. However, this is incorrect because the MEX of `c` should be `4` if both players play optimally.
   - For the input `2 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `0` because `0` is not in the array.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for determining the MEX is correct, but the logic for simulating the turns of the game is flawed.
   - The variable `first` does not accurately represent the turn of the game, and the program does not correctly simulate the optimal strategy for both players.

Given the above reasoning, the program does not correctly solve the problem by following the optimal strategy for both players.

Final: **False**
