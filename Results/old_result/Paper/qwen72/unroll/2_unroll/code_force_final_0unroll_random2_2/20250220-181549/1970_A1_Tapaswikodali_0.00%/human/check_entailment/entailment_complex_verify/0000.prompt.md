You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
        
    #State: `s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `balance` is 0. `details` is a list containing tuples, each with the current balance, the negative index, and the character at that index, for every character in the string `s`.
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join(char for _, _, char in details)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence of length not exceeding 500,000)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses with a maximum length of 500,000. It processes the string to create a list of tuples containing the current balance, the negative index, and the character at each position. After sorting this list, it constructs a new string from the characters in the sorted list and prints this new string. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the input string `s` using `input()`, which is appropriate for the given problem description.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The program maintains a running balance of the parentheses sequence. For each character in the string:
   - If the character is '(', it increments the balance.
   - If the character is ')', it decrements the balance.
   - It appends a tuple `(balance, -i, char)` to the `details` list, where `balance` is the current balance, `-i` is the negative index (to break ties in decreasing order of position), and `char` is the character itself.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance in increasing order, and for ties, it uses the negative index to sort in decreasing order of position. This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted `details` list and joining them together.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description:
- It correctly processes a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence.
- It ensures that the balance of each prefix is non-negative.
- It correctly sorts the characters to form the balanced shuffle.

Given the above points, the program is correct for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
