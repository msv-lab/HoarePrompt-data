The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5).
- `y` is an integer and y = 0.
- The list of `x` integers contains distinct values from 1 to `n`.

The function returns a value based on the input parameters. However, the specific return value or condition is not provided in the output section. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` can only be described based on the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5, and `y` is an integer that is always 0. The list of `x` integers contains distinct values from 1 to `n`.**
