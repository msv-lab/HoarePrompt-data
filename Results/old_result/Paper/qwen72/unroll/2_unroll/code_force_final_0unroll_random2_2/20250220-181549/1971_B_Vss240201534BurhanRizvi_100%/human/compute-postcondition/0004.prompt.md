You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the function should be called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        if len(s) == 1:
            print('No')
        elif len(set(s)) == 1 and len(s) > 1:
            print('No')
        else:
            s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
            if s == s2:
                s2 = s[1:] + s[0]
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, if the string `s` has a length of 1 or all characters in `s` are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of `s` that is different from the original `s`. The variable `s` is re-assigned in each iteration based on the input provided, and the loop runs `t` times. After all iterations, the variable `t` remains unchanged, and `s` will be the last input string processed in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` is called within a loop that processes `t` test cases, where `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, the function accepts a single parameter `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function's specific return value or output is not provided.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
