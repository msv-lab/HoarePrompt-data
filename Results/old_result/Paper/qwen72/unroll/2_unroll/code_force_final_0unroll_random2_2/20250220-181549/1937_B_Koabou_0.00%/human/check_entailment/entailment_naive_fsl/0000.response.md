Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
001
010
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0001
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0010
1
```

In this case, the lexicographically smallest string is "0001", and there are two paths that yield this string: one that goes right, right, down, and right, and another that goes right, down, right, and right. However, the program incorrectly outputs "0010" as the lexicographically smallest string and "1" as the number of paths, which is incorrect.
