The function `func_1` reads a list of six integers from the input, representing the dimensions of a board (`h`, `w`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`). It then determines the outcome of a game between Alice and Bob based on the positions of their chips. The function prints either 'Alice', 'bob', or 'draw' depending on the game's result and does not return any value. The final state of the program is that the input has been processed, and the game's outcome has been printed to the console.
