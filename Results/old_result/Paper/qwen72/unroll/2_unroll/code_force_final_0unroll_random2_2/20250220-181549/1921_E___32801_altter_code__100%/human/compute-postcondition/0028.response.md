The code snippet `t = abs(y2 - y1)` calculates the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1` and assigns it to the variable `t`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`
- `x2` is equal to `r[4]`
- `x2` is greater than `x1`
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`
- If `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1` and `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, and `a` is `y2 - 1`
- If `y1` < `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] + 1` and `y2` is greater than `y1`, and `a` is equal to `r[1] - y2`
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`

The value of `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. Since `y1` and `y2` are not equal, `t` will be a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, and `a` is `y2 - 1`. Otherwise, `y1` is `r[3] + 1`, `y2` is greater than `y1`, and `a` is equal to `r[1] - y2`. `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.**
