Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times. In each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, and a list `a` of integers from input. It then processes the list `a` to create two new lists `ans1` and `ans2` based on the sorting and selection criteria described in the loop. After processing, it prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are re-initialized in each iteration, so their values are not retained between iterations. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is the only variable that persists across all iterations.**
