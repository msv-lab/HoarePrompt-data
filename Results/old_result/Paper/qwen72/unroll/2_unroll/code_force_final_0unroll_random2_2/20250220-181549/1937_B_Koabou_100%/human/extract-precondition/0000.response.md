Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the integer `n` for each test case, and the two binary strings `a1` and `a2` representing the rows of the 2 x n grid. Additionally, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a1` and `a2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
