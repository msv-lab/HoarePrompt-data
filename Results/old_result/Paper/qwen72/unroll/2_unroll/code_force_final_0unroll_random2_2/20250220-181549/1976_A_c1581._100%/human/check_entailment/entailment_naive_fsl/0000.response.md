Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle cases where there are both letters and digits in the password, and the letters come after the digits. According to the problem description, after each letter, there should be either another letter or the string should end. However, the program allows letters to come after digits, which is incorrect.

Example of a case where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  123ac
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

The program incorrectly returns "YES" because it does not check the condition that no digit should come after a letter.
