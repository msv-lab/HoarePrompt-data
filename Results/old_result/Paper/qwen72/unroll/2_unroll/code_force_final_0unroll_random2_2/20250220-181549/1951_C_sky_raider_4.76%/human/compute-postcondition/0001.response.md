Output State: **For each test case, the output is the integer value of `c`, which represents the total cost of buying `k` tickets, considering the minimum cost strategy. The loop iterates through the sorted list of ticket prices, `l`, and calculates the total cost by buying the maximum number of tickets possible each day, up to `m` tickets, until `k` tickets are bought. The variable `c` is updated to include the cost of tickets bought each day, adjusted by the formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, where `s` is the number of tickets bought on day `i`. After all iterations, `c` is printed as an integer.**

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes executing for each test case, the output is the total cost of buying `k` tickets at the lowest possible prices, with the cost adjusted by a specific formula. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the variable `c` is updated and printed for each test case.
