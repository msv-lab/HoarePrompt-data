To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the object in the loop head, which is the result of `int(input())`.

The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0. This means the number of test cases must be a positive integer. The other details about the inputs (n, k, x, and the list of integers) are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
