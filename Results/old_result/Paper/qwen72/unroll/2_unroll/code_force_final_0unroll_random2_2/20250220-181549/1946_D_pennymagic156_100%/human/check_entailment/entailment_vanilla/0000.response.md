### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to handle input. However, these functions are not used consistently. For example, `func_2` and `func_4` are defined but not used in the main logic.
   - The main function `func_5` is responsible for processing each test case.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` reads the input for each test case, which includes the length of the array `n` and the target number `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `t` and a variable `ans` set to -1.
   - The loop iterates over the bits of the numbers from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - For each bit position `i`, it extracts the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in the array `a`.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is also 0, it continues to the next bit.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is not 0, it checks if the sum is odd. If it is, it returns `ans` immediately because it's impossible to satisfy the condition. If the sum is even, it tries to split the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0. It then appends the XOR of these segments to `t` and resets `a` to `t`.

4. **Handling Non-Zero Bits**:
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is odd, it continues to the next bit.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is even and non-zero, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0. It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the count of such segments.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is 0, it breaks the loop.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum of `ans` and the length of the array `a`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The logic for splitting the array into segments based on the `i`-th bit and checking the conditions is sound.
- The program correctly updates `ans` and returns the maximum number of segments or -1 if no valid segments can be found.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
