Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0.**

The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the user input, but they still adhere to the initial conditions that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The `permutation` list remains a list of `n` zeros. The variable `idx` is initialized to 0.
