The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, but it will take on the values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

Given that `t` is assigned the value of an input integer, and the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
