Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is greater than the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day (`m`) and the prices increase after each purchase. Specifically, the program does not account for the price increase after purchasing tickets on a given day, which is a crucial part of the problem description.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 1 3
1 2 3 4 5
```

**Expected Output:**
```
9
```

**Actual Output:**
```
12
```

**Explanation:**
- On the first day, the price is 1, and you can buy 1 ticket. The cost is 1.
- On the second day, the price is 2, and you can buy 1 ticket. The cost is 2.
- On the third day, the price is 3, and you can buy 1 ticket. The cost is 3.

The total cost should be 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. However, the program does not account for the price increase after each purchase, leading to an incorrect total cost of 12.
