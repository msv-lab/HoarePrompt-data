The function `func` accepts two parameters: `a` and `k`. `a` is a list of integers of length `2n`, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor\), and `n` is an integer with the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).

The function returns a value based on the following cases:
- Case_1: If `k` is 1, the function returns the minimum number of swaps required to make the first `n` elements of `a` a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`.
- Case_2: If `k` is greater than 1, the function returns the minimum number of swaps required to make every group of `k` consecutive elements in `a` a permutation of the integers from 1 to `k`.
