Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case to find the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions, and prints the result for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of people `n` and the maximum allowable final position `k` (which is `m` in the problem statement).
   - It then reads two lists of integers, `lista_A` and `lista_B`, which represent the costs `a_i` and `b_i` respectively. These lists are reversed to facilitate the processing from the end of the queue to the front.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `soma_b` to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative cost of moving through positions.
   - It also initializes `pref` to 0, which will store the minimum cost to move to a position before the current one.
   - The first loop iterates over the positions from `n` to `n - k` (reversed order). For each position, it checks if the cost to move to the current position `a_i` is less than the cost `b_i` of moving through the intermediate positions. If so, it updates `pref` with the total cost of moving to this position and resets `soma_b`. Otherwise, it adds the cost `b_i` to `soma_b`.

3. **Final Position Calculation**:
   - The second loop iterates over the positions from `n - k` to `n` (reversed order). For each position, it calculates the total cost to move to this position and updates `resultado` with the minimum of the current `resultado` and the calculated cost.
   - After the loop, it prints the minimum cost `resultado`.

4. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the program handles multiple test cases as required.

The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements, and the program should produce the correct output for the given inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
