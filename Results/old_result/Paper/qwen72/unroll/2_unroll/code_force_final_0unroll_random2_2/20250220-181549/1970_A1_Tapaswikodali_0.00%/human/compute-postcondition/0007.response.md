Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
1. **`s`**: This is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.
2. **`balance`**: This is an integer initialized to 0.
3. **`details`**: This is a sorted list containing tuples, each with the current balance, the negative index, and the character at that index, for every character in the string `s`, sorted by the current balance in ascending order.
4. **`result`**: This is a string that is the same as `s`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(result)
```

### Analysis:
- The variable `result` is explicitly stated to be the same as the string `s`.
- Since `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence, `result` will also be a balanced parentheses sequence.
- The `print(result)` statement will simply print the string `s`.

### Output:
Output: **s (where s is a balanced parentheses sequence of length not exceeding 500,000)**

This means that the output will be the exact same string `s` that was provided in the initial state, which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
