The function `func_1` reads multiple test cases from the standard input, each defined by a tree with `n` vertices and a specific vertex `k`. For each test case, it constructs the adjacency list of the tree, performs a binary search to determine the maximum value `L` such that the number of cuts required to isolate a subtree of at least `L` vertices does not exceed `k`, and prints the result `L` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the initial state of `t` remains unchanged.
