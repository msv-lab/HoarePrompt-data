Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

# Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_5())

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as parameters to the function. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_1():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the space-separated list of integers provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input and returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value provided by the user through input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user through input. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has received an integer input from the user, and this integer is the return value of the function.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature. The function `func_3` reads input from the standard input and returns a map object of integers. It does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a string from the standard input, splits the string into parts, and returns a map object containing these parts converted to integers. The function does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the user input as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and returns the resulting string.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and x are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 0 ≤ x < 2^30, and a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30.

            break
        
    #State: `n` and `x` remain unchanged, `a` is transformed based on the loop conditions, `t` is an empty list, and `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` that have a 0 in the \( i \)-th bit, where `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0`.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of list `a`, where `ans` is the maximum count of elements in `a` that have a 0 in the \( i \)-th bit, under the conditions that `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no parameters directly but internally uses the values of `n` and `x` returned by `func_3`, and a list `a` of `n` integers returned by `func_1`. It processes the list `a` based on the bitwise conditions of `x` and the elements in `a`. The function returns the maximum value between the length of the transformed list `a` and the count of elements in `a` that have a 0 in the \( i \)-th bit, where \( u == 1 \) and \( v \% 2 == 0 \). The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function execution.
