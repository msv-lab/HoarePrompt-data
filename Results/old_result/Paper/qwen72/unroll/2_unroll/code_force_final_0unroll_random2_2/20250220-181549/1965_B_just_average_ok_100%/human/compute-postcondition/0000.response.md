To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
2. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute at least once, `int(input())` must return a positive integer.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.

The state before the loop starts should ensure that `int(input())` returns a value that is at least 1, which is consistent with the range of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**
