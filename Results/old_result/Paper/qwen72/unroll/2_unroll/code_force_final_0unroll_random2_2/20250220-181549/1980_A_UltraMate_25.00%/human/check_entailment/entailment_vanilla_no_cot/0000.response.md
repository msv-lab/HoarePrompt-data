Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not account for the difficulty level 'G', which is mentioned in the problem description. The string `p` is defined as `'ABCDEF'`, which means the program will not check for the presence or count of 'G' problems. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where 'G' problems are required.

### Corrected Program:
To fix this, you should include 'G' in the string `p` so that it checks for all required difficulty levels.

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Include 'G' in the string
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            else:
                if hmp[i] < m:
                    ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

### Example Test Cases:
- For the input:
  ```
  3
  10 1
  BGECDCBDED
  10 2
  BGECDCBDED
  9 1
  BBCDEFFGG
  ```
  The corrected program will output:
  ```
  2
  5
  1
  ```

This matches the expected output, so the corrected program is correct.
