The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9. The function returns 'yes' in one case and 'no' in another case.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It returns 'yes' in one case and 'no' in another case, based on the values of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the elements of `l`.**
