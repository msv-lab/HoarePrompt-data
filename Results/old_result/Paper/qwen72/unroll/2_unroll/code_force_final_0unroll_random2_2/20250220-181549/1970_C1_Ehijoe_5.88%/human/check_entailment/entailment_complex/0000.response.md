### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Tree Construction**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input values `n` and `t` from the first line.
   - It then reads `n-1` lines to construct the tree. Since the tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, it can be represented as a linear path (an array-like structure).
   - The tree is constructed using a `deque` to efficiently append nodes to both ends. The `empty` flag is used to initialize the deque with the first edge, and subsequent edges are appended to the appropriate end based on the current state of the deque.

2. **Initial Stone Position**:
   - The function reads the starting node `start` from the input.
   - It finds the index `idx` of `start` in the `tree` deque.

3. **Move Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the number of moves the stone can make to either end of the tree. This is done using the `min` function to consider the number of moves to the left (`idx`) and to the right (`n - idx - 1`).
   - The `moves` list contains these two values.

4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The function checks if at least one of the moves is an odd number. If so, it prints "Ron" because Ron can make the last move and win the game.
   - If both moves are even, it prints "Hermione" because Hermione will make the last move and win the game.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The game is played on a linear path (array-like tree) with exactly two leaves.
- The player who makes the last move wins. Since the tree is linear, the number of moves to either end determines the winner.
- If the number of moves to either end is odd, the player who starts (Ron) can always make the last move and win.
- If both numbers of moves are even, the player who starts (Ron) will be forced to make an even number of moves, and Hermione will make the last move and win.

### Edge Cases:
- The function correctly handles the construction of the tree and the initial position of the stone.
- The function correctly calculates the number of moves and determines the winner based on the parity of the moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
