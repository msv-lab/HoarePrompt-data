Output State: **The function `func` will print the calculated value of `ans` for each test case, where `ans` is the sum of `n` and the result of the inner loop for each `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`. The inner loop increments `ans` by `(n + b) // (b * b)` for each `b`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` will remain unchanged after the loop completes.**
