Functionality: ** The function `func_3` takes two parameters, `primary_items` and `secondary_heap`, both of which are lists of tuples. Each tuple contains two integers representing the prices of an item for Alice and Bob. The function calculates the total sum of the first elements of the tuples in `secondary_heap` and adds to this sum the combined prices (first element + second element) of the tuples in `primary_items` where the combined price is non-negative. The function returns this total sum. **
