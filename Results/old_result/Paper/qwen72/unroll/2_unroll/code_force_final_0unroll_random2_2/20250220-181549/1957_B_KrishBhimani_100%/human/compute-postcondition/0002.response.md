The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with `n` in the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and returns a value based on these parameters.**
