### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and `alphabet` as a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character `i` in `s`:
     - If `i` is in the `alphabet` set, it removes `i` from the set.
     - If the set `alphabet` is not empty, it adds `i` to `s1`.
     - If the set `alphabet` is empty, it adds `i` to `s2` and resets the `alphabet` set.
   - After processing the string, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, it means not all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence by appending the missing character (if any) to `s2`.
   - If the boolean is `True`, it appends "Yes" to the output list `OUT`.

4. **Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the task of checking if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The logic for constructing `s1` and `s2` is flawed. The function only checks if the string `s` contains all `k` alphabets at least once, but it does not check if all possible combinations of length `n` are subsequences.
   - The calculation of `r` and the substring `s1[r * k:]` does not make sense in the context of the problem. It does not help in determining if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.
   - The construction of the missing string in the output is also incorrect. It simply repeats the missing character, which may not be a valid string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences of `s`, and the logic for generating a missing string is flawed.
