### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines several input handling functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`), but only `func_3` and `func_1` are used in the main logic. This is consistent with the problem description, as `func_3` is used to read the values of `n` and `x`, and `func_1` is used to read the array `a`.
   - The main function `func_5` is responsible for processing each test case, which is also consistent with the problem description.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` reads the input for each test case, including the length of the array `n` and the target number `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `t` and a variable `ans` set to -1. This is appropriate for the problem, as `ans` is used to store the maximum number of valid segments found, and `t` is used to store intermediate results.

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - The loop iterates over the bits from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0). This is correct because the problem involves bitwise operations, and checking bits from the most significant to the least significant is a common approach.
   - For each bit position `i`, it extracts the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in the array `a`.

4. **Handling Zero Bits in `x`**:
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is also 0, it continues to the next bit. This is correct because it means that the `i`-th bit does not affect the result.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is not 0, it checks if the sum is odd. If it is, it returns `ans` immediately because it's impossible to satisfy the condition. This is correct because if the sum is odd, there is at least one segment where the `i`-th bit is 1, which would make the bitwise OR greater than `x`.
   - If the sum is even, it tries to split the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0. It then appends the XOR of these segments to `t` and resets `a` to `t`. This is correct because it ensures that the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0, which helps in maintaining the bitwise OR condition.

5. **Handling Non-Zero Bits in `x`**:
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is odd, it continues to the next bit. This is correct because it means that the `i`-th bit of the XOR of the entire array is 1, which is allowed.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is even and non-zero, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0. It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the count of such segments. This is correct because it ensures that the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0, which helps in maintaining the bitwise OR condition.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is 0, it breaks the loop. This is correct because it means that the `i`-th bit of the XOR of the entire array is 0, which is allowed, and there is no need to further split the array.

6. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum of `ans` and the length of the array `a`. This is correct because it ensures that the maximum number of valid segments is returned, and if no valid segments are found, the length of the array is considered.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for splitting the array into segments based on the `i`-th bit and checking the conditions is sound. The program correctly updates `ans` and returns the maximum number of segments or -1 if no valid segments can be found.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
