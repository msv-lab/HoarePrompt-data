Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, but it does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. The penalty is defined as the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the subarrays, each multiplied by their length. The program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays or calculate the penalty based on these subarrays.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. Parse the input string to convert it into an array of 1s and -1s.
2. Find an optimal way to split the array into subarrays that minimizes the total penalty.
3. Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum them up to get the total penalty.

The current program simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty as defined in the problem statement.
