The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and the list `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must contain at least one tuple. Each tuple in `cases` should contain the required elements (n, m, k, a, b) with the specified constraints. Before the loop starts, the `results` list being empty does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Given the constraints, for the loop to execute, `cases` must have at least one tuple, and `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` should be initialized to the values of the first tuple in `cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers n, m, and k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even), followed by two lists of integers a and b (1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6) representing the arrays a and b, respectively. `cases` must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first integer in the first tuple, `m` is the second integer in the first tuple, `k` is the third integer in the first tuple, `a` is the first list in the first tuple, `b` is the second list in the first tuple, `results` is an empty list.**
