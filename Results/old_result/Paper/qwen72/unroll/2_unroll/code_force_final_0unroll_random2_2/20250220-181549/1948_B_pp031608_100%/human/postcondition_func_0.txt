The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `m` (2 ≤ m ≤ 50) and a list of `m` integers `arr` (0 ≤ arr_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits in increasing order followed by the element itself. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `n` will be unchanged, and the variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans` will have their final values from the last iteration.
