Reasoning:

The provided Python program is intended to solve the problem described. However, there are several issues with the implementation:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the game and determine the number of winners for a given number of players `b` and a sequence `a`. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game. It simply returns `a - 1` if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and returns `b` otherwise. This does not match the game's rules where players are removed based on the sequence `a`.

2. **Input Parsing**: The input parsing is correct in that it reads the number of test cases, the values of `k` and `q`, the sequence `a`, and the list of `n_i` values. However, the function `func_1` is not being called with the correct parameters. It should be called with the sequence `a` and each `n_i` value, but it is only being called with the first element of `a` and each `n_i`.

3. **Output Format**: The output format is incorrect. The program should output the number of winners for each `n_i` in a single line for each test case, but the current implementation prints each result followed by a space and then a newline after each test case, which is not the required format.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
