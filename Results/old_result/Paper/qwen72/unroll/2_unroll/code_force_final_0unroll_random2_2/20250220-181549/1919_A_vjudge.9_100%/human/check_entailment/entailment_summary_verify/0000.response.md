### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program's logic is flawed. The program's decision is based solely on the parity (even or odd) of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. However, this does not accurately capture the game's rules and the optimal strategy that both players can employ.

Let's break down the game logic:

1. **Initial Condition**: Alice and Bob start with `a` and `b` coins, respectively.
2. **Turns**: Alice goes first, and each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet and then remove one coin.
3. **Winning Condition**: The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

The key to solving this problem is understanding the optimal strategy:

- If both players have the same number of coins, the game will end in a draw if they both play optimally. However, since the game must have a winner, the player who goes second (Bob) will always win because he can mirror Alice's moves.
- If the number of coins is different, the player with more coins can always force the game into a state where the number of coins in both wallets is the same, and then the player who goes second (Bob) will win.

The program's logic is based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`. This is incorrect because:

- **Even Difference**: If `abs(a - b)` is even, it does not necessarily mean that Bob will win. For example, if `a = 2` and `b = 1`, the difference is 1 (odd), but Alice can win by swapping wallets and then forcing Bob to remove his last coin.
- **Odd Difference**: If `abs(a - b)` is odd, it does not necessarily mean that Alice will win. For example, if `a = 1` and `b = 2`, the difference is 1 (odd), but Bob can win by mirroring Alice's moves.

### Correct Strategy:

To determine the winner correctly, we need to consider the following:

- If `a` and `b` are both even or both odd, the player who goes second (Bob) will win because he can always mirror the moves of the first player (Alice).
- If one of `a` or `b` is even and the other is odd, the player who goes first (Alice) will win because she can force the game into a state where both players have the same number of coins, and then Bob will be forced to lose.

### Correct Implementation:

The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if (a % 2 == b % 2):
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program provided does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. The correct logic should be based on the parity of the number of coins in each player's wallet, not the parity of their difference.

Final: **False**
