The only variables in the loop head are `i`, `n`, and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `1` and `n // k + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n // k + 1` must be greater than `1`. This means that `n // k` must be at least `1`, which implies `n` must be at least `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4
- `v` is the largest integer `i` in the range [1, n] for which `func_2()` returns `n`. If no such `i` exists, `v` remains 1.

For the loop to execute:
- `n // k` must be at least `1`, which is already satisfied by the condition `1 <= k <= n`.
- `i` must start at `1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` and `k` are such that the loop can execute, and `i` is initialized to `1`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `v` is the largest integer `i` in the range [1, n] for which `func_2()` returns `n` (if no such `i` exists, `v` remains 1), `i` is 1, `n // k` must be at least 1**
