### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for \( k \) excursions.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers.
   - We need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It then reads \( m \) pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, summing these values into `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), which is correctly calculated as `cn2`.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for a single excursion is \(\frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Over \( k \) excursions, the expected value is \( k \cdot \frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - Additionally, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion. The expected number of times a pair of friends is chosen is \( k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \), and each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for the remaining \( k-1 \) excursions.
   - Therefore, the additional expected value is \( k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot (k-1) \).

4. **Combining the Expected Values:**
   - The total expected value is:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = k \cdot \frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}} + k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot (k-1)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot m \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - The program correctly calculates this as:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program correctly simplifies the fraction by dividing both \( p \) and \( q \) by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
   - The program correctly computes the modular inverse of \( q \) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then multiplies \( p \) by the modular inverse of \( q \) and takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 \).
  - For each test case, \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \) are integers where \( 2 \le n \le 10^5 \), \( 0 \le m \le \min(10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2}) \), and \( 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
  - \( a_i \), \( b_i \), and \( f_i \) are integers for each of the \( m \) lines, where \( 1 \le a_i, b_i \le n \), \( a_i \neq b_i \), and \( 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 \).
  - The sum of \( n \) and the sum of \( m \) over all test cases do not exceed \( 10^5 \), and the sum of \( k \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

- **Function `func` Processing:**
  - The function processes \( t \) test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
  - It reads \( m \) lines of input, each containing \( a_i \), \( b_i \), and \( f_i \), and correctly sums the friendship values into `sum_f`.
  - It calculates the total number of possible pairs of children as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.
  - It correctly calculates \( p \) and \( q \) as:
    \[
    p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)
    \]
    \[
    q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
    \]
  - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both \( p \) and \( q \) by their GCD.
  - It computes the modular inverse of \( q \) and multiplies it by \( p \), taking the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
  - The function prints the result for each test case.
