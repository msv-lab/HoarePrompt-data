### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Code Analysis:**
   - The initial code snippet contains a commented-out block of code that seems to be a brute-force approach to solving the problem.
   - The actual implementation uses a more optimized approach.

3. **Optimized Approach:**
   - The code iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - It then checks if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) and adds \(x\) to the sum if the condition is true.
   - Finally, it prints the sum minus 1.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be a valid integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be a non-negative integer, and \(a\) must be within the range \([1, n]\).

5. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - The term \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is subtracted from \(a\) to account for the offset.
   - The division by \(i^2\) and adding 1 is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code subtracts 1 from the final sum before printing. This is necessary because the formula might count an extra pair that is not valid.
   - The condition \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) ensures that \(a\) is positive and within the range.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - The formula used is derived from the problem's mathematical condition and seems to be correct.
   - The edge case handling (subtracting 1 from the final sum) is also appropriate.

However, there is a critical issue in the code that needs to be addressed:

- **Issue with the Formula:**
  - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not correctly aligned with the problem's condition. The formula should be derived from the condition \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The correct approach should involve iterating over \(b\) and for each \(b\), finding the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy the condition. The formula should be:
    \[
    a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
    \]
  - The current formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not directly correspond to the problem's condition and may lead to incorrect results.

8. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation would involve iterating over \(b\) and for each \(b\), finding the number of valid \(a\) values that satisfy \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - This can be done by checking the condition for each \(a\) in the range \([1, n]\).

The given program does not correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and the mathematical insights. The formula used in the code is not aligned with the problem's requirements, leading to potential incorrect results.
