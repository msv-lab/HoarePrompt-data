### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to handle input. However, only `func_3` and `func_1` are used in the main logic.
   - The main function `func_5` is responsible for processing each test case.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function `func_5` reads the input for each test case, which includes the length of the array `n` and the target number `x`.
   - It initializes an empty list `t` and a variable `ans` set to -1.
   - The loop iterates over the bits of the numbers from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).

3. **Bitwise Operations**:
   - For each bit position `i`, it extracts the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in the array `a`.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is also 0, it continues to the next bit.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is not 0, it checks if the sum is odd. If it is, it returns `ans` immediately because it's impossible to satisfy the condition. If the sum is even, it tries to split the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0. It then appends the XOR of these segments to `t` and resets `a` to `t`.

4. **Handling Non-Zero Bits**:
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is odd, it continues to the next bit.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is even and non-zero, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0. It updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the count of such segments.
   - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements is 0, it breaks the loop.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The function returns the maximum of `ans` and the length of the array `a`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Correctness of Bitwise Operations**:
  - The program correctly checks the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array elements.
  - The conditions for handling the bits are logically sound:
    - If `u == 0` and `v == 0`, it continues to the next bit.
    - If `u == 0` and `v % 2 == 1`, it returns `ans` because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.
    - If `u == 0` and `v % 2 == 0`, it splits the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0.
    - If `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 1`, it continues to the next bit.
    - If `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0` and `v > 0`, it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0 and updates `ans`.
    - If `u == 1` and `v == 0`, it breaks the loop.

- **Segment Splitting**:
  - The segment splitting logic is correct. It ensures that the XOR of each segment has a 0 in the `i`-th bit, which is necessary for the bitwise OR condition to be satisfied.
  - The program correctly appends the XOR of these segments to `t` and resets `a` to `t`.

- **Final Output**:
  - The final output is the maximum of `ans` and the length of the array `a`, which is the correct approach to find the maximum number of segments.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic for handling the input, processing the bits, and splitting the array into segments is sound. The program correctly updates `ans` and returns the maximum number of segments or -1 if no valid segments can be found.

Final: **True**
