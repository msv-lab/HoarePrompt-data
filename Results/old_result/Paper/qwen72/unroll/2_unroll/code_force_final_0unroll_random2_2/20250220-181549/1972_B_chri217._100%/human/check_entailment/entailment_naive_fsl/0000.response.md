Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the game's rules and edge cases. Specifically, the function `func_2` only counts the number of 'U' coins and determines the winner based on whether this count is odd or even. However, this approach does not consider the game's dynamics, such as the removal of a coin and the flipping of adjacent coins, which are crucial for determining the winner.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
3
UUD
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, Alice starts with "UUD":
- Alice can only choose the first 'U', which results in "DD".
- Bob then chooses the first 'D', and the second 'D' is not flipped (as it would be flipped twice), resulting in an empty string.
- Alice has no more moves and loses.

The program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks the parity of the number of 'U' coins, without considering the actual game mechanics. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
