### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided solution step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
- **Input:** Multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
- **Output:** For each test case, determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. If possible, print "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices for each stall. If not possible, print "NO".

#### Program Analysis:
The program provided has a function `func_1` which is called for each test case. Let's break down what `func_1` does:

1. **Base Case:**
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins, she can buy `k` jewels from a single stall priced at 1 coin per jewel.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

2. **General Case:**
   - It initializes `costs` with two values: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - It calculates `h` by iterating over `costs` and performing the following operations:
     - `curr = n // i` (where `i` is an element of `costs`).
     - `h += curr`.
     - `n -= i * curr`.
   - If `h < k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of `costs`.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1(n, k)`:
  - Prints "YES" and 1, 1 if `n == k`.
  - Prints "NO" if `n < k`.
  - Otherwise, it calculates `h` and prints "NO" if `h < k`.
  - If `h >= k`, it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of `costs`.

#### Issues:
1. **Stall Limit:**
   - The function always prints 2 stalls, which is not sufficient to handle cases where `k` is greater than 60. This is a significant issue because the problem constraints state that Bob can set up at most 60 stalls.

2. **Correctness of Stall Prices:**
   - The function calculates `costs` as `[n - k + 1, 1]` and then checks if the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from these two stalls (`h`) is at least `k`.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of setting up more than 2 stalls to achieve the desired number of jewels.

#### Example:
- For `n = 1000` and `k = 70`:
  - The function will set `costs` to `[931, 1]`.
  - It will calculate `h` as follows:
    - `curr = 1000 // 931 = 1` (Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall).
    - `h += 1` (h = 1).
    - `n -= 931 * 1 = 69` (Alice has 69 coins left).
    - `curr = 69 // 1 = 69` (Alice buys 69 jewels from the second stall).
    - `h += 69` (h = 70).
  - Since `h == k`, it will print "YES", 2, and the elements of `costs` (931, 1).
  - However, this is incorrect because it only uses 2 stalls, and the problem requires at most 60 stalls.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than 60 correctly, and it always prints 2 stalls, which is not sufficient to meet the problem constraints.

Final: **False**
