Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program only explicitly handles the cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any other value of \( n \) within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This behavior is incorrect according to the problem description, which requires the program to output a checkerboard for any valid \( n \). For example, if \( n = 5 \), the program should generate a 10x10 checkerboard, but it does not. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for all valid inputs.

Final: **False**
