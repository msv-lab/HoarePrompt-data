You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        cases.append((n, s))
    return cases

#Function 2:
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum((1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U'))
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

cases = func_1()
for case in cases:
    print(func_2(case))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each (n, s) in cases is a tuple where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D".
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` remains the same as the initial input integer value, `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` read from the input.
    return cases
    #The program returns the list `cases` which contains `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` read from the input.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list where case[1] is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing the state of the coins.
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in `case[1]` is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case, storing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to a list `cases`.
   - This function correctly handles the input format and stores the test cases in a list, which is then returned.

2. **Game Logic (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` takes a single test case `(n, s)` as input.
   - It counts the number of facing-up coins (`U`) in the string `s` using a generator expression and the `sum` function.
   - The key observation here is that the game is won by the player who can make the last move. Since each move removes one facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins, the number of facing-up coins changes by an odd number (either +1 or -1) each turn.
   - Therefore, the player who starts with an odd number of facing-up coins will always be able to make the last move, and the player who starts with an even number of facing-up coins will always lose if both players play optimally.
   - The function returns 'YES' if the number of facing-up coins is odd, and 'NO' otherwise.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - The game is deterministic, and the outcome depends solely on the initial number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always win because she can always make the last move.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always win because he will be the one to make the last move.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins (the player who is supposed to make a move loses).
   - The function also handles the case where there are only one or two coins left, as the logic of counting facing-up coins and determining the winner based on the parity of this count is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the initial number of facing-up coins. The input parsing and the game logic are both correct and consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
