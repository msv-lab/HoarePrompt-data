You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 \leq t \leq 1000, and for each test case, a and b are integers such that 1 \le a, b \le 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: The loop has executed t times, and for each iteration, it has read two integers a and b from the input. If the absolute difference between a and b is even, it has printed 'Bob'. If the absolute difference between a and b is odd, it has printed 'Alice'. The values of t, a, and b are unchanged after the loop, but the loop has completed its execution and produced the specified output for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. It then reads `t` pairs of integers `a` and `b` (where `1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9`) from the input. For each pair, the function checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even. If it is, the function prints 'Bob'. If the absolute difference is odd, the function prints 'Alice'. After processing all `t` test cases, the function completes its execution without returning any value. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` are not modified and are not accessible outside the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics**:
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns removing a coin from their current wallet, with the option to swap wallets.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a non-empty wallet) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they will always make the best possible move to avoid losing.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game can be analyzed based on the parity (odd or even) of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is even, Bob will always win. This is because Alice and Bob can always mirror each other's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can remove a coin, and vice versa), and the game will end when both wallets are empty, with Bob making the last move.
   - If the difference between the number of coins in the two wallets is odd, Alice will always win. This is because Alice can always make the first move to create an even difference, and then Bob will be forced to mirror Alice's moves, leading to Alice making the last move.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, respectively.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic implemented in the program correctly follows the key insight described above.
   - The program handles multiple test cases and correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in the wallets.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
