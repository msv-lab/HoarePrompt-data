You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 20`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the size of a checkerboard to be generated. The function then prints a specific checkerboard pattern to the console based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints a 2x2 checkerboard. If `n` is 2, it prints a 4x4 checkerboard. If `n` is 3, it prints a 6x6 checkerboard. If `n` is 4, it prints an 8x8 checkerboard. If `n` is outside the range of 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the variable `casos` remains equal to `t`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases for the input range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. It only explicitly handles the cases for n = 1, 2, 3, and 4. For any other value of n within the specified range, it prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. This violates the problem description, which requires the program to output a checkerboard for any valid n. For example, if n = 5, the program will not generate the expected 10x10 checkerboard.
