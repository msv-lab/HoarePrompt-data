Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for finding the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
010
101
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0010
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0101
1
```

The program incorrectly identifies the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths. The correct smallest string is "0010" and there are 2 paths that yield this string, but the program outputs "0101" and 1 path. This indicates that the program's logic for determining the smallest string and counting the paths is incorrect.
