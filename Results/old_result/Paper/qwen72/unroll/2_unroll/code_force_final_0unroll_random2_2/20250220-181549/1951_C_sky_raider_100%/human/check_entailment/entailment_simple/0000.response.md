### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list `l` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the program always buys tickets at the lowest possible price first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The variables `t`, `s`, `c` are initialized to 0. 
   - `t` keeps track of the total number of tickets purchased so far.
   - `s` is the number of tickets to buy on the current day.
   - `c` is the cumulative cost of the tickets.

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each day `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - On each day, the program calculates the number of tickets to buy `s` as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought in a day) and `k` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding the product of `s` and the price on the current day `l[i]` plus the total number of tickets bought so far `t`.
   - The total number of tickets bought `t` is incremented by `s`.
   - The remaining tickets needed `k` is decremented by `s`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the total cost `c` for the current test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program correctly sorts the prices to ensure that tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost first.
  - The loop ensures that the program buys the maximum number of tickets allowed on each day until the required number of tickets `k` is reached.
  - The cost calculation `c += s * (l[i] + t)` accounts for the increase in price due to the tickets bought on previous days.
  - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when `k` is less than or equal to `m` or when `k` is greater than `m`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If `k` is less than or equal to `m`, the program will buy all tickets on the first day.
  - If `k` is greater than `m`, the program will distribute the purchases over multiple days, always buying the maximum allowed on each day until `k` tickets are bought.

- **Performance:**
  - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
  - The loop runs in \(O(n)\) time.
  - The overall time complexity for each test case is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements. It efficiently calculates the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets while adhering to the constraints and rules provided.

### Correctness:
