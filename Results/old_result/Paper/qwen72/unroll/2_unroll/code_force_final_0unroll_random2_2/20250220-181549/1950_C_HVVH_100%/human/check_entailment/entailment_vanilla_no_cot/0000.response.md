Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, including handling the transition from AM to PM and the special cases for 00:00 and 12:00. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case one by one.
2. **Time Conversion**:
   - If the hour is 0, it is converted to 12 and marked as AM.
   - If the hour is greater than 12, it is converted to the corresponding hour in the PM period by subtracting 12.
   - If the hour is exactly 12, it is marked as PM.
   - For all other hours (1 to 11), it is marked as AM.
3. **Output Formatting**: The program uses formatted string literals (f-strings) to ensure that the hour and minute are always displayed with two digits, and the AM/PM indicator is correctly appended.

The program handles all the edge cases and correctly formats the output as required. Therefore, the program is correct.
