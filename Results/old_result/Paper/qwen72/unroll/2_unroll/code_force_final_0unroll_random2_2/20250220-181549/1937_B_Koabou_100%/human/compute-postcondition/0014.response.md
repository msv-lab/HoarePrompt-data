The function `func_1` is expected to accept parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the integer `n` for each test case, and the two binary strings `a1` and `a2` representing the rows of the 2 x n grid. The parameter `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a1` and `a2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the result of a computation based on the input parameters. However, the specific output based on the input parameters is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept these parameters and return a result, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a1`, and `a2`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. `n` is an integer representing the length of the binary strings for each test case, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. `a1` and `a2` are binary strings of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
