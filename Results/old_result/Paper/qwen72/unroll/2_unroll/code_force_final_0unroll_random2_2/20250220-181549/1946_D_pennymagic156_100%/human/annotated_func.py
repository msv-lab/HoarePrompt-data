#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed as parameters to the function. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_1():

    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the space-separated list of integers provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input and returns a list of integers, where each integer is derived from the input. The function does not modify any external variables or state.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_2():

    #The program returns an integer value provided by the user through input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user through input. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it has received an integer input from the user, and this integer is the return value of the function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature. The function `func_3` reads input from the standard input and returns a map object of integers. It does not take any parameters.
def func_3():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a string from the standard input, splits the string into parts, and returns a map object containing these parts converted to integers. The function does not accept any parameters. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_4():
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns the user input as a string with leading and trailing whitespace removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, removes any leading and trailing whitespace from the input, and returns the resulting string.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no parameters directly but internally uses the values of `n` and `x` returned by `func_3`, and a list `a` of `n` integers returned by `func_1`. It processes the list `a` based on the bitwise conditions of `x` and the elements in `a`. The function returns the maximum value between the length of the transformed list `a` and the count of elements in `a` that have a 0 in the \( i \)-th bit, where \( u == 1 \) and \( v \% 2 == 0 \). The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function execution.
