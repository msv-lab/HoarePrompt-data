### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers. This conversion is valid because the input is guaranteed to be a binary string.

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The function counts the number of '0's in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`. This is necessary for the subsequent calculations.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The function initializes a counter `cnt` to keep track of the number of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in the string `s` and updates the counter `cnt` accordingly.
   - For each '0' encountered, it adds 1 to `ans` if there is at least one '1' before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
   - For each '1' encountered, it adds the number of '0's that have not been counted yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing each test case, the function prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

5. **Algorithm Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost is based on the idea that the cost of a cyclic shift is the length of the substring being shifted. The function aims to minimize the total cost by counting the number of '1's before each '0' and the number of '0's after each '1', which is a valid approach to determine the minimum cost.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the string is already sorted by printing 0.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function should handle strings of length 2 to 200,000 and multiple test cases up to 10,000. The provided logic does not violate these constraints.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order. The reasoning and the steps taken in the function align with the problem description and the expected output.

### Correctness:
**True**
