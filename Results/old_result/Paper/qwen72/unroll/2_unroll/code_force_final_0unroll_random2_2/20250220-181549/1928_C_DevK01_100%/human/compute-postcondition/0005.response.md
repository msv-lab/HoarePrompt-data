Output State: **`q` and `x` are integers such that 1 <= x < q <= 10^9, `M` is an empty list if `w` is not an integer or if `w` is an integer but less than `x - 1`. If `w` is an integer and `w` is greater than or equal to `x - 1`, `M` contains the integer `w`, and `w` is the square root of `q`. `i` is 1.**
