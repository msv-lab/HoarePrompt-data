Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a detailed explanation of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem's input format.

2. **Constraints Processing**:
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `cx` as a set to keep track of the integers that `k` must not be equal to.
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the upper bound of `k` and `bx` to a very small number (`-1`) to represent the lower bound of `k`.

3. **Constraint Types**:
   - If the constraint type `a` is 1, it updates `bx` to the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`, ensuring that `k` must be at least `bx`.
   - If the constraint type `a` is 2, it updates `ax` to the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`, ensuring that `k` must be at most `ax`.
   - If the constraint type `a` is 3, it adds `x` to the set `cx`, ensuring that `k` must not be equal to any of the values in `cx`.

4. **Validation and Calculation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is the case, it appends 0 to the result list `r` because no integer can satisfy the constraints.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by computing `ax - bx + 1` and subtracting the count of integers in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.

The program correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
