Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func` only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4) and does not generate the correct checkerboard pattern for any other value of `n` within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). According to the problem description, the program should output a 2n × 2n checkerboard for any valid `n`. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirements for `n` values outside of 1, 2, 3, and 4, which is a significant limitation.

Final: **False**
