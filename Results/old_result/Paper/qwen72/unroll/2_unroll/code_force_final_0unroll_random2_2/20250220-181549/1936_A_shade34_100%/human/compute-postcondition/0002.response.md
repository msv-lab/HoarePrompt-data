The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, and `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
