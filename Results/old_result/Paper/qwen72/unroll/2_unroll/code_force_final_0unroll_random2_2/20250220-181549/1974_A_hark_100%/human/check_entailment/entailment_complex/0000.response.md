### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `ap` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Logic for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The number of screens required for 2x2 icons is calculated as `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each screen can hold at most 2 of the 2x2 icons (since a screen is 5x3, and a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, leaving 11 cells free, which is enough for another 2x2 icon).

3. **Logic for 1x1 Icons**:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, the function calculates the number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is intended to account for the space taken by 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - However, this formula is incorrect. The correct approach should be to first allocate screens for 2x2 icons and then use the remaining space on those screens for 1x1 icons. If there are still 1x1 icons left, additional screens should be allocated for them.

4. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula for the number of screens required for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons should be:
     - `screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)`
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4`
     - `remaining_1x1_icons = x - remaining_cells`
     - `additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1_icons / 15)`
     - `total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1`

5. **Special Cases**:
   - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, the number of screens required is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, the number of screens required is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, the number of screens required is 0.

### Correctness:
The given program is **incorrect** because the formula used to calculate the number of screens required for 1x1 icons after placing 2x2 icons is flawed. The correct approach should be to first allocate screens for 2x2 icons and then use the remaining space on those screens for 1x1 icons, followed by allocating additional screens for any remaining 1x1 icons.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x == 0 and y == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
            remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
            remaining_1x1_icons = max(0, x - remaining_cells)
            additional_screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(remaining_1x1_icons / 15)
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
            print(total_screens)

func_1()
```
