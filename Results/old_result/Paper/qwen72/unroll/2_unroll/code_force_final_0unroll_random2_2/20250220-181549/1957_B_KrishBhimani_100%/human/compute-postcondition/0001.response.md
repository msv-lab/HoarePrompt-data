Output State: **The loop will read multiple test cases, each with two integers n and k. For each test case, if n == 1, it will print k. Otherwise, it will print a list of n integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than k, the second integer is the remainder of k after subtracting the first integer, and the remaining n-2 integers are 0. The loop will continue until all test cases have been processed.**
