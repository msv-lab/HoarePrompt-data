Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the lexicographically smallest word is flawed. Let's consider the case where the encoded value is 78:

- According to the problem, the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 78 should be "zzz" (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).
- However, the program will output "zzz" incorrectly as "azz" (1 + 26 + 26 = 53) or "bzz" (2 + 26 + 26 = 54), which are not the correct smallest words.

The program's logic for distributing the remaining value of `lex` among the three letters is not optimal and does not ensure the lexicographically smallest word is generated. For example, when `lex` is 78, the program will subtract 26 twice and then add the remaining 26 to the third letter, but it should instead distribute the 26s evenly to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.

Here is a correct approach to solve the problem:

1. Start by assigning the smallest possible value (1) to the first letter.
2. If the remaining value is still greater than or equal to 26, assign 26 to the second letter.
3. Assign the remaining value to the third letter.
4. Ensure the values are in the correct lexicographical order.

This approach ensures that the word is the lexicographically smallest possible word that sums to the given value.
