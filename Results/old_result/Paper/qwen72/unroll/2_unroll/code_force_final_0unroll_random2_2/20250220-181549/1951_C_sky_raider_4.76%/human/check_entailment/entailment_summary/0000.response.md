Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the list of ticket prices and then iteratively purchasing the maximum number of tickets possible each day until the required number of tickets \( k \) is reached. However, there are several issues with the implementation that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Initialization of `c`**:
   - The variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is not a valid initialization for the total cost. The correct initialization should be `0` since `c` is supposed to accumulate the total cost of purchasing tickets.

2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The loop updates `c` using the formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, which is incorrect. The correct formula should be `c += l[i] * s` to add the cost of purchasing `s` tickets at the price `l[i]` to the total cost.

3. **Incorrect Use of `s`**:
   - The variable `s` is set to `min(m, k)` inside the loop, which is correct. However, the loop should break once `k` becomes `0` to avoid unnecessary iterations.

4. **Incorrect Output**:
   - The final output should be the total cost `c`, but the program prints `int(c)`, which is not necessarily incorrect but should be consistent with the problem's requirements.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            c += l[i] * s
            k -= s
            if k == 0:
                break
        print(c)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initialization**: `c` is initialized to `0` to correctly accumulate the total cost.
- **Loop**: The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices. For each day, it calculates the number of tickets `s` to buy, which is the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets per day) and `k` (the remaining tickets needed).
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost for buying `s` tickets at price `l[i]` is added to `c`.
- **Update `k`**: The remaining tickets `k` are updated by subtracting `s`.
- **Break Condition**: The loop breaks once all required tickets are purchased (`k == 0`).

### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above. The corrected program should work as expected.

Correctness: **False**
