To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `iterable` and `loop`. The loop will execute if `loop` is greater than 0. The variable `iterable` will start from 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of an integer `n` such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints.
- Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same.
- `loop` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute, `loop` must be greater than 0. The variable `iterable` will start from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and no two constraints are the same, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0**
