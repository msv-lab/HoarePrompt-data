Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than 60 correctly. According to the problem description, Bob can set up at most 60 stalls. However, the program always prints 2 stalls, which is not sufficient to handle cases where `k` is greater than 60. For example, if `n = 1000` and `k = 70`, the program will still print 2 stalls, which is incorrect because Alice needs to buy 70 jewels, and it is impossible to achieve this with only 2 stalls while adhering to the constraints.
