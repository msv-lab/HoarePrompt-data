The code snippet `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to be the `read` method of `sys.stdin`. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `p`. The only change is that the `input` variable now points to the `read` method, which reads from standard input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n, `input` is now the `read` method of `sys.stdin`.**
