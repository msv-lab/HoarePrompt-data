Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2Ã—10^5, `t` is 1, `tree` is a deque containing a sequence of integers that form a path in the input graph, `empty` is False, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.** 

The code assigns the value of the index of `start` in the deque `tree` to the variable `idx`. All other variables remain unchanged.
