The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `start` and `end` are integers such that 0 <= start <= end, and the current directory contains subfolders with names that can be converted to integers within the range [start, end], and each of these subfolders may contain .html files. The function returns a list of .html files found in the subfolders that match the integer range [start, end].

Functionality: **The function returns a list of .html files found in subfolders within the current directory, where the subfolder names are integers within the specified range [start, end].**
