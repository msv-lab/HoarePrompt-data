Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Initial Answer**: The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`. This is incorrect because the number of valid pairs should start from 0, not `n`. The valid pairs are those that satisfy the given conditions, and starting from `n` assumes that all pairs `(a, 1)` are valid, which is not necessarily true.

3. **Loop for `b`**: The loop iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`. This is a reasonable range because `b` must be at least 1 and at most `m`.

4. **Condition Check**: The condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not correctly implemented. The current implementation uses `(n + b) // (b * b)`, which is incorrect. The correct condition should be checked for each `a` from 1 to `n` and each `b` from 1 to `m`.

5. **Correct Condition**: The correct condition should be:
   \[
   (a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0
   \]
   This needs to be checked for each `a` and `b`.

6. **Efficiency**: The current implementation is inefficient because it does not correctly count the valid pairs and uses an incorrect formula. A more efficient approach would involve iterating over `a` and `b` and checking the condition for each pair.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to count the valid pairs.

Correctness: **False**
