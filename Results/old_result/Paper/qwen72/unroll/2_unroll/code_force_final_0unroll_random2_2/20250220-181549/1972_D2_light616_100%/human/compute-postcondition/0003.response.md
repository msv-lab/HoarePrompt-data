The only variables in the loop head are `x` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `x * x <= n`. Right before the loop, `x` is 1, and `n` is an integer within the range 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6. 

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `x * x <= n` must be true. Since `x` is 1, `x * x` is 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the condition to be true. Given that `n` is already constrained to be within the range 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, the condition `x * x <= n` will always be true for the first iteration.

No adjustments are needed.
State: **`n` and `m` are integers read from the standard input, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6; `x` is 1; `cnt` is 0**
