To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions present in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:
```
for i in range(int(input())):
```
This loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. The loop will run `int(input())` times, where `int(input())` is the number of test cases `t`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The only variable in the loop head is `i`.
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - Since `t` is the number of test cases and it is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `int(input())` should be equal to `t`.

3. **Adjust the State to Ensure Loop Execution:**
   - The state before the loop starts should reflect that `t` is a valid integer within the given range.
   - The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index for the loop.

### Adjusted State:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
- `i` is 0.
- The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `i` is 0**
