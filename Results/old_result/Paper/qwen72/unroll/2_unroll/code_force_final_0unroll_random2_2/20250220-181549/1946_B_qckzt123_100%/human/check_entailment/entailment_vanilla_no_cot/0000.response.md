Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of the Maximum Subarray Sum:**
   - The program calculates the maximum subarray sum (`t`) using a simple loop that resets `tmp` to 0 whenever it becomes negative. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of negative subarrays contributing to the maximum sum when combined with other subarrays.

2. **Incorrect Update of `t` and `ans`:**
   - The program updates `t` by doubling it for each operation, which is not the correct way to maximize the sum after `k` operations. The correct approach should consider the maximum possible sum that can be added to the array in each operation.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The program correctly uses modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers, but the logic for updating `t` and `ans` is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem, you need to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations. The key insight is to maximize the sum by repeatedly adding the maximum subarray sum to the array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

def func():
    MOD = 1000000007
    T = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())
        a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split()))
        
        # Calculate the sum of the array
        s = sum(a)
        
        # Calculate the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm
        max_subarray_sum = 0
        current_max = 0
        for x in a:
            current_max = max(current_max + x, x)
            max_subarray_sum = max(max_subarray_sum, current_max)
        
        # If the maximum subarray sum is non-negative, we can use it to maximize the sum
        if max_subarray_sum >= 0:
            ans = s + max_subarray_sum * k
        else:
            ans = s
        
        # Output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7
        print(ans % MOD)

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - `s` is the sum of the array `a`.

2. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - `max_subarray_sum` is calculated using Kadane's algorithm, which finds the maximum subarray sum in linear time.

3. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - If `max_subarray_sum` is non-negative, we can add it `k` times to the sum `s` to maximize the array sum.
   - If `max_subarray_sum` is negative, adding it will not increase the sum, so the final answer is just the sum `s`.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final answer is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` to ensure it fits within the required range.

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
