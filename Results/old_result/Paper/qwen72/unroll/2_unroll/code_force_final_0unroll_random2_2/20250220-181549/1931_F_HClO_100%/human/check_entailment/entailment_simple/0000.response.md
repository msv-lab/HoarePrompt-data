### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (number of participants and number of screenshots).
   - If `m` is 1, it directly prints "yes" because a single screenshot can always correspond to a valid order.

2. **Initial Comparisons:**
   - The program reads the first two screenshots and stores them in `l1` and `l2`, respectively.
   - It then creates `l11` and `l22` by removing the author of the second screenshot from `l1` and the author of the first screenshot from `l2`.

3. **Order Validation:**
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, it means the orders are inconsistent, and the program prints "no" and continues to the next test case.
   - If they are equal, the program proceeds to find the positions where `a1` and `a2` should be inserted to form a consistent order.

4. **Insertion and Further Validation:**
   - The program determines the indices `idx1` and `idx2` where `a2` and `a1` should be inserted, respectively.
   - It then inserts `a2` or `a1` into the appropriate list to form a consistent order.
   - If `m` is 2, it directly prints "yes" because the two screenshots are already consistent.
   - For more than two screenshots, it reads the remaining screenshots and stores them in `val`.

5. **Final Validation:**
   - The program checks if the remaining screenshots are consistent with the formed order by comparing the lists.
   - If any screenshot is inconsistent, it prints "no".
   - If all screenshots are consistent, it prints "yes".

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Single Screenshot Case:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where `m` is 1 by printing "yes" immediately.

- **Two Screenshots Case:**
  - The program correctly checks if the two screenshots can be made consistent by removing the author of the other screenshot and comparing the remaining lists.
  - If they are consistent, it correctly determines the positions to insert the authors to form a consistent order.

- **Multiple Screenshots Case:**
  - The program correctly reads the remaining screenshots and stores them in `val`.
  - It then checks if the remaining screenshots are consistent with the formed order.
  - The logic for determining the insertion positions and validating the remaining screenshots is sound.

### Edge Cases:

- **Consistent Orders:**
  - The program correctly identifies consistent orders and prints "yes".
- **Inconsistent Orders:**
  - The program correctly identifies inconsistent orders and prints "no".

### Conclusion:

The program appears to handle all the cases as described in the problem statement and the provided example. The logic and flow of the program are correct.
