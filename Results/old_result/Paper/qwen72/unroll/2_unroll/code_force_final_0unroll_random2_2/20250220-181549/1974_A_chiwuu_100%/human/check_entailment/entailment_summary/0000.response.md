### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `t` is initialized to `b`, which is the number of 2x2 icons.
   - The function then calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. Since each screen can hold up to 6 (15 / 4) 2x2 icons, the calculation is:
     - If `b` is even, `t = b // 2`.
     - If `b` is odd, `t = b // 2 + 1`.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - The function calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The remaining space `t1` is calculated as `t * 15 - b * 4`.

4. **Screen Calculation for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space `t1` is sufficient to place all the 1x1 icons (`a`), the number of screens `t` remains the same.
   - If the remaining space `t1` is not sufficient, the function calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons:
     - `t2` is the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed.
     - If `t2` is a multiple of 15, the additional screens needed are `t2 // 15`.
     - If `t2` is not a multiple of 15, the additional screens needed are `t2 // 15 + 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of screens `t` required for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
- The function then correctly calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
- The function correctly calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons if the remaining space is not sufficient.

However, there is a logical error in the calculation of `t` for the 2x2 icons. The number of screens needed for 2x2 icons should be calculated as:
- `t = (b + 1) // 2` (which is equivalent to `t = b // 2 + b % 2`).

The current implementation:
- `t = b // 2` if `b` is even.
- `t = b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd.

This is correct, but it can be simplified to `t = (b + 1) // 2`.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct and produces the correct output for the given test cases. The only minor improvement is the simplification of the screen calculation for 2x2 icons, but this does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Correctness:
**True**
