The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and `i` is initialized correctly for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 <= `t` <= 5 * 10^4, `i` is 0**
