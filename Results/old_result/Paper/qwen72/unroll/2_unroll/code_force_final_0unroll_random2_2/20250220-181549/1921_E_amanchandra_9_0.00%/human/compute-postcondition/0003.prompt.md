You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that it should handle multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. These integers should satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9, and either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The function should also handle an input integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb = map(int, input().split())
        
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <=
                    x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, ya - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x])
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions provided in the loop. The values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` will be read from input for each iteration, and the loop will continue to the next test case until all `t` test cases have been processed. The final state of the loop will be that all `t` test cases have been evaluated and the corresponding results printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with six integers `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b` that satisfy specific conditions. It also accepts an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. The function returns the result of each test case, though the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
