Postcondition: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `nodes` remains a defaultdict(list) with the same keys and values as in the initial state, `edges` remains an empty list, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is a deque containing all the keys from `nodes` that have exactly one neighbor, `start` is now an integer provided by the user, `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and `moves` is empty (i.e., `moves` is `False`).**
