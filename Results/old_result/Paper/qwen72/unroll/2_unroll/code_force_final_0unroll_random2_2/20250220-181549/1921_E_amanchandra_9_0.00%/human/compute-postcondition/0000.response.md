The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. This result represents the number of test cases, which is denoted by `t` in the problem description. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
