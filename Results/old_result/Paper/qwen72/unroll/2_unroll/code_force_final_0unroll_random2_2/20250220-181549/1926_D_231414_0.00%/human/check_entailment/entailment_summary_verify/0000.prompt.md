You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        dic = dict()
        ans = n
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if s in dic:
                dic[s] -= 1
                ans -= 1
                if dic[s] == 0:
                    del dic[s]
            elif i in dic:
                dic[i] += 1
            else:
                dic[i] = 1
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `data`. It then processes `data` to count and print the number of unique integers after each iteration, where an integer is considered unique if it does not have a pair that results in a specific XOR value with `2^31 - 1`. The function does not return any value but prints the count of unique integers for each test case. After the function concludes, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 · 10^5, and `data` contains integers within the range 0 to 2^31 - 1. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the problem as described. The logic in the program attempts to use a dictionary to track the XOR of each number with a check value, but this approach is flawed. The check value is set to `2 ** 31 - 1`, which is `11111111111111111111111111111111` in binary. This value is used to XOR with each number, but the program does not correctly ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
1
1
```

In this case, the numbers `1`, `2`, and `3` have the following binary representations:
- `1` = `00000000000000000000000000000001`
- `2` = `00000000000000000000000000000010`
- `3` = `00000000000000000000000000000011`

The program incorrectly prints `1` for each number, suggesting that all three numbers can be placed in the same group, which is not true. The correct output should be `2` because the numbers `1` and `3` share the same least significant bit, and thus cannot be in the same group. Similarly, `2` and `3` share the same second least significant bit, and thus cannot be in the same group. Therefore, the minimum number of groups required is `2`.
