You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1

    2 1 1

    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` children and `m` pairs of friends.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value `f_i`.
   - The teacher goes on `k` excursions and randomly selects a pair of children each time.
   - If the selected pair is friends, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - We need to find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions, and return the result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in any given excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected number of times a specific pair of friends is chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair of friends over `k` excursions is the sum of the expected increases for each excursion, which is \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} \frac{2}{n(n-1)} = k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).

3. **Sum of Friendship Values:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in their friendship value is \( k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The initial friendship value of a pair is `f_i`.
   - The expected total friendship value for a specific pair after `k` excursions is \( f_i + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - Summing this over all `m` pairs of friends gives the total expected value:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \right)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i + m \cdot k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)}
     \]

4. **Modulo Calculation:**
   - The final result needs to be computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - We need to compute the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) to handle the division in the expected value calculation.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - It calculates the total expected value by summing \( f_i \cdot \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) for each pair of friends.
     - However, this is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of selection and the correct expected value formula.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - It reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
     - The input reading and calling of `func_1` are correct, but the logic inside `func_1` is flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect and does not account for the probability of selecting each pair of friends. The correct approach should involve calculating the expected increase in friendship value for each pair and summing these values.
