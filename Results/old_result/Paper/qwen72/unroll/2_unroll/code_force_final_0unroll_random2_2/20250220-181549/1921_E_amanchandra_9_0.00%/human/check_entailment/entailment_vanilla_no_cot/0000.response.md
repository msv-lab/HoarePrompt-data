Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a few issues that need to be addressed to correctly determine the outcome of the game for each test case. Here are the specific problems:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Draw Conditions**:
   - The condition `if xa > xb:` is used to determine if the game is a draw. However, this is not a sufficient condition. The game can end in a draw if Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, but it can also end in a draw if the chips are in positions where they cannot meet in the middle of the board.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Possible Moves**:
   - The calculation of `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` and the subsequent logic for determining the possible positions of the chips is flawed. The logic should consider the parity of the difference in the x-coordinates and the relative positions of the chips on the y-axis.

3. **Incorrect Use of `max` and `min` Functions**:
   - The use of `max(1, yb - x)` and `min(w, yb + x)` in the draw condition is incorrect. These should be based on the y-coordinates of Alice's chip, not Bob's chip.

4. **Incorrect Output Logic**:
   - The output logic for determining whether Alice or Bob wins is incorrect. The conditions for Alice and Bob winning should be based on the relative positions of the chips and the possible moves they can make.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # If Alice is in the last row or Bob is in the first row, it's a draw
        if xa == h or xb == 1:
            print("Draw")
        else:
            # Calculate the number of moves until Alice and Bob meet in the same row
            moves = (xb - xa) // 2
            
            # Determine the range of y-coordinates where Alice and Bob can meet
            l = max(1, ya - moves)
            r = min(w, ya + moves)
            
            # Check if Bob's chip is within the range where Alice can move to
            if l <= yb <= r:
                print("Draw")
            else:
                # If the number of moves is odd, Alice wins
                if (xb - xa) % 2 == 1:
                    print("Alice")
                else:
                    # If the number of moves is even, Bob wins
                    print("Bob")
```

This corrected program should correctly determine the outcome of the game for each test case based on the provided problem description.
