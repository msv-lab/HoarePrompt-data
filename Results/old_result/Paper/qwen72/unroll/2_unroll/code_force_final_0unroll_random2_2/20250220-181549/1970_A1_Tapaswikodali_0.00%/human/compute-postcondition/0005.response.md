The code snippet `details.sort()` sorts the list `details` based on the first element of each tuple (the current balance). The sorting is done in ascending order. The other variables (`s` and `balance`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is the same non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. `balance` is 0. `details` is a sorted list containing tuples, each with the current balance, the negative index, and the character at that index, for every character in the string `s`, sorted by the current balance in ascending order.**
