### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Looping**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen and stores them in `list0`.

2. **Sorting the Chosen Vertices**:
   - The program sorts the list of chosen vertices `list0`. This is necessary to easily find the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.

3. **Counting Gaps of Size 1**:
   - The program iterates through the sorted list and counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements. This is done by checking if `list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1 == 1` and incrementing `count` if true.
   - This step is correct because a gap of size 1 between two chosen vertices means that there is exactly one vertex between them that can be used to form a triangle with the two chosen vertices.

4. **Handling the Last Vertex**:
   - The program checks if the gap between the last chosen vertex and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic) is of size 1. This is done by checking if `n - list0[-1] == 1` and incrementing `count` if true.
   - This step is also correct because it ensures that the cyclic nature of the polygon is taken into account.

5. **Calculating the Number of Triangles**:
   - The program prints `count + x - 2` for each test case.
   - The reasoning behind this is that for `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2` (since a triangle is formed by 3 vertices, and each additional vertex can form one more triangle).
   - The `count` variable adds the number of additional triangles that can be formed by the gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It correctly counts the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive chosen vertices.
- It correctly handles the cyclic nature of the polygon.
- The final calculation `count + x - 2` is correct for the given problem constraints.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
