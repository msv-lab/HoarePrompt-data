The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of each test case to the console. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a sorted list of `n` integers `p`. The function calls `func_1(n, p)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `results` to the console. The function does not return any value.
