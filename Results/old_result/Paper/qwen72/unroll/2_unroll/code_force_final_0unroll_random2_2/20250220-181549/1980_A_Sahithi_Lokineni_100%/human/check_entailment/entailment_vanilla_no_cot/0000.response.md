Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a few issues that need to be addressed for it to work correctly according to the problem description:

1. **Initialization of `defaultdict`**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with `default_value`, which is not defined. This will cause a `NameError` when the program runs. Instead, it should be initialized with `int` or a function that returns `0`.

2. **Logic for counting required problems**: The logic to calculate the number of additional problems needed is incorrect. The program checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m` and then calculates the difference. However, it should check if the count is less than `m` and add the difference to `ans`.

3. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is defined but not used in the program. It can be removed as it serves no purpose.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization of `defaultdict`**: The `defaultdict` is now initialized with `int`, which will default to `0` for any new key.
2. **Counting required problems**: The program iterates over the characters 'A' to 'G' and checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m`. If it is, it adds the difference `m - d[val]` to `ans`.
3. **Removed unused function**: The `func_1` function has been removed as it was not used.

This corrected program should now work as intended and produce the correct output for the given problem.
