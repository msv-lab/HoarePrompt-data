### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Code Analysis:**
   - The initial code snippet contains a commented-out block of code that seems to be a brute-force approach to solving the problem.
   - The actual implementation uses a more optimized approach.

3. **Optimized Approach:**
   - The code iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - It then checks if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) and adds \(x\) to the sum if the condition is true.
   - Finally, it prints the sum minus 1.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be a valid integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be a non-negative integer, and \(a\) must be within the range \([1, n]\).

5. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - The term \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is subtracted from \(a\) to account for the offset.
   - The division by \(i^2\) and adding 1 is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code subtracts 1 from the final sum before printing. This is necessary because the formula might count an extra pair that is not valid.
   - The condition \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) ensures that \(a\) is positive and within the range.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - The formula used is derived from the problem's mathematical condition and seems to be correct.
   - The edge case handling (subtracting 1 from the final sum) is also appropriate.

### Detailed Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is incorrect based on the problem description. It should be `def func(n, m):` where `n` and `m` are the input integers.
  - The function reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.

- **State of the program within the loop:**
  - For each test case, it reads a pair of integers `(a, b)` from the input.
  - The commented-out block of code is a brute-force approach that iterates over all possible pairs \((i, j)\) and checks the condition. This is not used in the final implementation.
  - The actual implementation iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
  - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
  - It then checks if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) and adds \(x\) to the sum if the condition is true.
  - Finally, it prints the sum minus 1.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Function Definition:**
  - The function should be defined as `def func(n, m):` instead of `def func():`.
  - The function should take `n` and `m` as parameters and not read them from input within the function.

- **Formula and Logic:**
  - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is not directly derived from the problem's condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The logic to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) is flawed. The formula does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func(n, m):
    def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        return count

    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        n, m = int(info[0]), int(info[1])
        result = count_valid_pairs(n, m)
        print(result)

# Example usage
# func(10, 8)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the formula used in the code does not correctly implement the problem's condition. The code's logic is flawed and does not count the valid pairs correctly.

Final: **False**
