### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
   - The first element in the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the function reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The game involves removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins.
   - The key observation is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move when it is her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always have a move when it is his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no moves left.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function counts the number of `'U'` in the string `s` using `s.count('U')`.
   - If the count is odd, it appends `'YES'` to the results list, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count is even, it appends `'NO'` to the results list, indicating Bob wins.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the results list.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `5 UUDUD`
  - Number of facing-up coins: 3 (odd)
  - Alice wins, so the output should be `'YES'`.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `5 UDDUD`
  - Number of facing-up coins: 2 (even)
  - Bob wins, so the output should be `'NO'`.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `2 UU`
  - Number of facing-up coins: 2 (even)
  - Bob wins, so the output should be `'NO'`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and produces the correct results for the given test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
