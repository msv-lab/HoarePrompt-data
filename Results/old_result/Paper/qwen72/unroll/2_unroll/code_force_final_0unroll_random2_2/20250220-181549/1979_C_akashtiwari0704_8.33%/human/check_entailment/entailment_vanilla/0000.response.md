### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the product of all multipliers `prod`.
   - This product is used to ensure that the bets are distributed in such a way that the total sum of bets is strictly less than the product.

3. **Bet Calculation**:
   - For each outcome, the function calculates the bet as `prod // a[i]`.
   - This ensures that if the i-th outcome is the winning one, the return is `a[i] * (prod // a[i]) = prod`, which is the same for all outcomes.

4. **Sum of Bets**:
   - The function sums up all the calculated bets `sumo`.
   - If `sumo` is greater than or equal to `prod`, it prints `-1` indicating that there is no valid distribution of bets.
   - Otherwise, it prints the bets.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Approach**:
  - The idea of using the product of all multipliers to distribute the bets is a common strategy to ensure that the return for any winning outcome is the same and equal to the product.
  - However, the condition `sumo < prod` ensures that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. This is the key requirement of the problem.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If all multipliers are the same, the sum of bets `sumo` will be `bets * (prod // a[0])`. For example, if `a = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]`, then `prod = 5^5 = 3125` and `sumo = 5 * (3125 // 5) = 3125`. In this case, `sumo` is equal to `prod`, and the function correctly prints `-1`.

- **General Case**:
  - For most cases, the product of the multipliers will be much larger than the sum of the bets, ensuring that `sumo < prod`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. It handles edge cases where no valid distribution exists by printing `-1`.

### Correctness:
**True**
