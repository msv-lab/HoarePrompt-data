Output State: The `info` list remains unchanged, containing `cases` sublists, each of which is a sorted list of three integers representing the positions of three lowercase Latin letters. The `cases` variable remains unchanged. The loop prints a string of three lowercase Latin letters for each sublist in `info`, where each letter corresponds to the position in the sublist (adjusted by 96 to convert to the ASCII value of the lowercase letter). The printed strings are the result of the loop, but the `info` list itself is not modified.
