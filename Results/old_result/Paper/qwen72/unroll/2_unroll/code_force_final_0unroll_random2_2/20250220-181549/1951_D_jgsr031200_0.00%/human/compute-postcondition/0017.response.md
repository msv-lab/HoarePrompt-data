Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `k` remains unchanged (we don't know the exact value of `k`).
   - `costs` remains unchanged (we don't know the exact value of `costs`).
   - `h` is calculated as `k + (n - k + 1) // (n - k + 1)`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Calculation of `h`:**
   - Given `n` is 0, the expression `(n - k + 1)` simplifies to `(0 - k + 1)`, which is `1 - k`.
   - The expression `(1 - k) // (1 - k)` is the integer division of `1 - k` by `1 - k`. If `1 - k` is not zero, this division will result in 1.
   - Therefore, `h` is calculated as `k + 1`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `h` is greater than or equal to `k` is always true because `h` is `k + 1`, which is always greater than `k`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The code snippet contains the statement `print(2)`.
   - This statement will print the integer 2, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, `costs`, or `h`.

Based on the above analysis, the output of the print statement is:

Output: **2**
