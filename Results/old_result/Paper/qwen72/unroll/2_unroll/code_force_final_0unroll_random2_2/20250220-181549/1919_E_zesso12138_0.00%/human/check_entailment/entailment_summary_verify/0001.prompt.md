You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        dp = new_dp
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results of each test case to the console. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a sorted list of `n` integers `p`. The function calls `func_1(n, p)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element of `results` to the console. The function does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a sorted prefix sum array `p` of an unknown array `a` that consists only of 1 and -1.
   - We need to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can produce the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The result should be modulo 998,244,353.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - `dp` is an array of size `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums (from `-n` to `n`).
   - `offset` is used to shift the index so that `0` prefix sum is at the center of the `dp` array.
   - `dp[offset]` is initialized to 1 because there is exactly one way to have a prefix sum of 0 with an empty array.
   - For each element in the array `a`, we update the `dp` array to reflect the possible prefix sums after adding 1 or -1.
   - The final result is the value in `dp` corresponding to the final prefix sum `p[-1]` plus the offset.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases in `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads all input at once and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of integers and processes each test case by extracting the values of `n` and `p`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 and the prefix sum array `p` is `[0]` or `[1]`.
   - The function `func_1` ensures that the prefix sums are within the valid range by using the `offset`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and reads the input efficiently.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is applied correctly in the dynamic programming update step to ensure the result fits within the required range.

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the given example, the function `func_1` correctly identifies the number of possible arrays `a` for each test case:
     - Test case 1: `n = 1`, `p = [0]` -> No possible array `a` (result is 0).
     - Test case 2: `n = 1`, `p = [1]` -> One possible array `a` (result is 1).
     - Test case 3: `n = 3`, `p = [-1, 1, 2]` -> No possible array `a` (result is 0).
     - Test case 4: `n = 5`, `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` -> Three possible arrays `a` (result is 3).
     - Test case 5: `n = 5`, `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]` -> One possible array `a` (result is 1).

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all edge cases and constraints as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
