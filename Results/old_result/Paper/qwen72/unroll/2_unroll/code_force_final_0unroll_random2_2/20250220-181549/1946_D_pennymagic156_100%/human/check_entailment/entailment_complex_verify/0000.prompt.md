You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

    -1

    2
    
Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no parameters directly but internally uses the values of `n` and `x` returned by `func_3`, and a list `a` of `n` integers returned by `func_1`. It processes the list `a` based on the bitwise conditions of `x` and the elements in `a`. The function returns the maximum value between the length of the transformed list `a` and the count of elements in `a` that have a 0 in the \( i \)-th bit, where \( u == 1 \) and \( v \% 2 == 0 \). The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function execution.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input array `a` is empty. According to the problem description, the length of the array `a` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), but the program does not explicitly check this condition. If an empty array were to be passed (which should not happen according to the constraints but is a potential edge case to consider), the program would fail because it would attempt to iterate over an empty list, leading to incorrect behavior or an exception.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the input format for multiple test cases. The problem description specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t`. However, the program does not read this value and does not loop over the test cases. This means that the program will only process the first test case and ignore the rest, leading to incorrect output for the given example and any other input with multiple test cases.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
```
Input:
2
3 1
1 2 3
2 2
1 1

Expected Output:
2
2

Actual Output:
2
```

The program only outputs the result for the first test case and does not process the second test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
