Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` is designed to count the maximum number of regular polygons (specifically, squares) that can be formed from the given sticks. However, the problem statement does not restrict the polygons to be squares only; it allows for any regular polygon (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.).

The current implementation of `func_1` only considers squares (4-sided polygons) by performing `v // 4` for each value `v` in the frequency dictionary. This means it counts how many sets of 4 sticks of the same length can be formed, which is not sufficient to solve the problem correctly. For example, if the input contains 5 sticks of the same length, the function would only count 1 square, but it should also count the possibility of forming a pentagon with those 5 sticks.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider all possible regular polygons and determine the maximum number of such polygons that can be formed. This involves checking for the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with 3 or more sides, not just 4.

Correctness: **False**
