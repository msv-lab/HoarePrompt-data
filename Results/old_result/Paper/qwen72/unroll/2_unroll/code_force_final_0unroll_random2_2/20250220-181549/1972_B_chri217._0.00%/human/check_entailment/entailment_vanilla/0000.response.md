### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Rules:**
   - The game involves a circle of coins, each of which can be either facing up ("U") or facing down ("D").
   - Players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the two adjacent coins.
   - If only two coins are left, one is removed and the other is not flipped.
   - If only one coin is left, no coins are flipped.
   - If no facing-up coins are left, the player whose turn it is loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - The key to determining the winner is to understand the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have a move when it is her turn, and she can force Bob into a position where he has no moves left.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob will always have a move when it is his turn, and he can force Alice into a position where she has no moves left.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) coins in the string `s`.
   - It then checks if the count of 'U' coins is odd or even.
   - If the count is odd, it returns 'YES' (Alice wins).
   - If the count is even, it returns 'NO' (Bob wins).

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The input is read in one go using `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input as a single string.
   - The input is then split into a list of strings using `split()`.
   - The first element of the list is the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the number of coins `n` and the string `s` are extracted from the list.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the string `s` to determine the winner.

5. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly counts the number of facing-up coins.
   - The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
