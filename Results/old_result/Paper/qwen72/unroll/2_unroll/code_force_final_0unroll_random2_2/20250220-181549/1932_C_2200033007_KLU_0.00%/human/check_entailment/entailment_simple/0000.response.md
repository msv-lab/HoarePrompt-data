Reasoning:

The annotated program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the remainder of the product of the elements of the array `a` at each step before removing an element as specified by the command string `s`. Here are the specific issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The function `func_1` appends the elements of `a` to the list `b` based on the commands in `s`, but it does not compute the product of the remaining elements of `a` at each step. Instead, it simply appends the elements to `b` and then calculates the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order, which is not what the problem requires.

2. **Incorrect Remainder Calculation**: The program should output the remainder of the product of the current elements of `a` at each step, but the current implementation only calculates the cumulative product of the elements that have been removed, which is a different operation.

3. **Order of Operations**: The program should first output the remainder of the product of the current elements of `a`, and then remove the element based on the command. The current implementation does not follow this order.

To fix the program, we need to maintain the product of the current elements of `a` and update it correctly at each step. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = (product * a[l]) % m if s[i] == 'L' else (product * a[r]) % m
        b.append(product)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    
    return b

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))
```

In this corrected version:
- We maintain a variable `product` to keep track of the product of the current elements of `a`.
- Before each removal, we compute the remainder of the product of the current elements of `a` and append it to the list `b`.
- We then update the `product` by removing the appropriate element from `a` based on the command in `s`.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
