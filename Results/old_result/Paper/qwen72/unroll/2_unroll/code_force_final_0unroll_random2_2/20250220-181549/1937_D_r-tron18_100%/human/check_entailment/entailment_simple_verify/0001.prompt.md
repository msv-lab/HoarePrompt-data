You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a grid of length `n` where each cell contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid (either from the left or right border).
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each placing the pinball on a different cell and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that calculates the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific position.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time for each query.

3. **Breaking Down `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the prefix sum of `pre` with an initial value of 0.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store the suffix sums of indices where the character is '<'.
     - `ans` is a list to store the results for each query.
   - **Processing the Grid:**
     - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
     - If the current cell contains '>', it calculates the time based on the number of '>' and '<' characters and their positions.
     - If the current cell contains '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates the time similarly.
   - **Output:**
     - The results are printed for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function is used to calculate the difference between the last element of an array and the element at a specific position.
     - It is correctly implemented and used in the main function.
   - **Function `func_2`:**
     - The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is complex but follows the problem's rules.
     - The program correctly handles the inversion of characters and the movement of the pinball.
     - The use of prefix and suffix sums helps in efficiently calculating the required times for each query.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program handles cases where the grid is entirely '<' or '>'.
     - It also handles cases where the grid has a mix of '<' and '>', ensuring the pinball leaves the grid within a finite number of steps.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums ensures that the calculations are efficient.
   - The program handles all edge cases and follows the problem's constraints.
