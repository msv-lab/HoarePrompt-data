### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the list of `n^2` integers `l`.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element:**
   - The program finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`. This is correct because `a_{1,1}` is the smallest element in the progressive square.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square:**
   - The program generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to `n-1`. This is the correct formula based on the problem description.

4. **Sorting and Comparing:**
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted lists `li` and `l` are equal. If they are, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints correctly: `2 <= n <= 500`, `1 <= c, d <= 10^6`, and `1 <= l[i] <= 10^9`.
   - The sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed `25 * 10^4`, which is within the problem's constraints.

6. **Output:**
   - The program outputs 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, which matches the required output format.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given list of integers can form a progressive square based on the provided `n`, `c`, and `d`. The steps are logically sound and handle the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
