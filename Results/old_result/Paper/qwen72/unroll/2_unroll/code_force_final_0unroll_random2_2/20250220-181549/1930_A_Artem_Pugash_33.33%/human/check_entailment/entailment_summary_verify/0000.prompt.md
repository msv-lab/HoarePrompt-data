You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a list of 2n integers. It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The state of the program variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged, as they are not modified within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error in the way it handles the input and processes the numbers. Specifically, the issue lies in the sorting and popping of elements from the list:

1. **Sorting and Popping**: The program sorts the list of numbers and then repeatedly pops the first two elements to add the minimum of them to the score. However, the `pop(0)` operation is inefficient and can lead to incorrect results if the list is not properly managed.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads the numbers as strings and attempts to sort them as strings. This can lead to incorrect sorting because string comparison is lexicographic, not numeric. For example, the list `["11", "2", "3"]` will be sorted as `["11", "2", "3"]` instead of `["2", "3", "11"]`.

3. **Edge Case**: Consider the input:
   ```
   1
   2
   10 20 30 40
   ```
   The program will sort the list as `['10', '20', '30', '40']` and then pop the first two elements repeatedly. This will result in the score being calculated as `10 + 20 = 30`, which is incorrect. The correct score should be `10 + 30 = 40`.

To fix the program, the numbers should be converted to integers before sorting, and the sorting should be done in ascending order to ensure that the minimum values are always chosen first. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version will ensure that the numbers are sorted correctly and the minimum values are always chosen, leading to the correct maximum score.
