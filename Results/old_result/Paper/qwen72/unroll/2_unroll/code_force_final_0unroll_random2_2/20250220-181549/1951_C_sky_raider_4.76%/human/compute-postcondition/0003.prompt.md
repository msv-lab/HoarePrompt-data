You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of sale days, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, and the total number of tickets to be bought, respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        l.sort()
        
        s = 0
        
        c = k * k / 2
        
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2
        
        print(int(c))
        
    #State: For each test case, the output is the integer value of `c`, which represents the total cost of buying `k` tickets, considering the minimum cost strategy. The loop iterates through the sorted list of ticket prices, `l`, and calculates the total cost by buying the maximum number of tickets possible each day, up to `m` tickets, until `k` tickets are bought. The variable `c` is updated to include the cost of tickets bought each day, adjusted by the formula `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, where `s` is the number of tickets bought on day `i`. After all iterations, `c` is printed as an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it accepts the number of sale days `n`, the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day `m`, the total number of tickets to be bought `k`, and a list of ticket prices `a` for each of the `n` days. It returns the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` days, considering the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day is `m`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
