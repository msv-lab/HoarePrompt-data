You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature, but the function internally uses variables such as `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`. These variables are expected to be initialized and manipulated within the function, with `test_cases` being a positive integer, `n` and `k` being non-negative integers where 0 <= k <= n, `prices` and `bonuses` being lists of positive integers, and `combined` being a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative integer and a positive integer.
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        
        remaining_items = []
        
        n, k = func_2()
        
        prices = list(func_2())
        
        neg_prices = [(-price) for price in prices]
        
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        
        max_profit = 0
        
        current_profit = 0
        
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        
        print(max_profit)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `test_cases` times, and after each iteration, the variables `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` are reset to their initial values within the loop. Therefore, after all iterations, these variables will not retain any specific final state from the last iteration, but the `max_profit` for each test case will be printed. The variables `test_cases` and any other variables not mentioned in the loop head and body remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. It returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting `k` items from a list of `n` items, where each item has a price and a bonus.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
