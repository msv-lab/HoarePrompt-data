Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 200,000, `lista_A` is a reversed list of integers of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, `lista_B` is now a reversed list of integers of length `n`, with each element in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, and `lista_B` has been updated with new values from the input, `soma_b` is 0.**
