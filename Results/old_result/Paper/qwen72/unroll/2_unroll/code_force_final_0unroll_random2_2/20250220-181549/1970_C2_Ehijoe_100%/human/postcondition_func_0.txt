The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `nodes` representing a tree, an integer `start` (1 <= start <= len(nodes)), and an integer or `None` `parent`. It returns `False` if the starting node `start` has only one adjacent node, and that adjacent node is the parent node. Otherwise, it recursively checks the subtree rooted at `start` and returns `True` if any node in the subtree has more than one adjacent node or if any node in the subtree is not directly connected to its parent.
