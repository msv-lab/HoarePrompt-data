### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns.
   - Each player can choose to swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After the choice, the player must remove 1 coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because the wallet is empty) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If both players play optimally, the key to determining the winner lies in the parity (odd or even) of the number of coins in their wallets.
   - If the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice keeps, Bob keeps. This ensures that Bob will always have a move after Alice, and thus Bob will win.
   - If the absolute difference is odd, Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob will eventually be unable to make a move. For example, if Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 4 coins, Alice can swap, and Bob will be forced to swap back, leading to a situation where Bob will eventually run out of coins first.

3. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.
   - It then checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints 'Bob'.
   - If the difference is odd, it prints 'Alice'.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - **Example 1:**
     - Input: `1 1`
     - Absolute difference: `|1 - 1| = 0` (even)
     - Output: `Bob` (Correct, as shown in the example)
   - **Example 2:**
     - Input: `1 4`
     - Absolute difference: `|1 - 4| = 3` (odd)
     - Output: `Alice` (Correct, as shown in the example)
   - **Example 3:**
     - Input: `5 3`
     - Absolute difference: `|5 - 3| = 2` (even)
     - Output: `Bob` (Correct, Bob can mirror Alice's moves)
   - **Example 4:**
     - Input: `4 5`
     - Absolute difference: `|4 - 5| = 1` (odd)
     - Output: `Alice` (Correct, Alice can force Bob into a losing position)

5. **General Correctness:**
   - The program correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - The logic is sound and matches the optimal play strategy described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
