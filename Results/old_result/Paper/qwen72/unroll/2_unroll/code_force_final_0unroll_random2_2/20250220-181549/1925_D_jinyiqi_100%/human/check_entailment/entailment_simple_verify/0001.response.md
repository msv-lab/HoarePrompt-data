### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for \(k\) excursions.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected value can be expressed as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime integers.
   - We need to compute \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\).
   - It then reads \(m\) pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, summing these values into `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating the Expected Value:**
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), which is correctly calculated as `cn2`.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for a single excursion is \(\frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Over \(k\) excursions, the expected value is \(k \cdot \frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Additionally, if a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion. The expected number of times a pair of friends is chosen is \(k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\), and each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for the remaining \(k-1\) excursions.
   - Therefore, the additional expected value is \(k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot (k-1)\).

4. **Combining the Expected Values:**
   - The total expected value is:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = k \cdot \frac{m \cdot \text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}} + k \cdot \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot (k-1)
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     \text{Total Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot m \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - The program correctly calculates this as:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program correctly simplifies the fraction by dividing both \(p\) and \(q\) by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
   - The program correctly computes the modular inverse of \(q\) using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then multiplies \(p\) by the modular inverse of \(q\) and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Validation of the Original Assessment:

- **Input Parsing:**
  - The program correctly reads and processes the input.
  - The constraints are respected and handled appropriately.

- **Expected Value Calculation:**
  - The formula used to calculate the expected value is correct.
  - The program correctly combines the initial friendship values and the additional values due to the excursions.

- **Simplifying the Fraction:**
  - The program correctly simplifies the fraction by finding the GCD and dividing both \(p\) and \(q\) by it.

- **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
  - The program correctly computes the modular inverse and applies the modulo operation to get the final result.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described, handles the input and output correctly, calculates the expected value accurately, and ensures the final result is in the required format.
