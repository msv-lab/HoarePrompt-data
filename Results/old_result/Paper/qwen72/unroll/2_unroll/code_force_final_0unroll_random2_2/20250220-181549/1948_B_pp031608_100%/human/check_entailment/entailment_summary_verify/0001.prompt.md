You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `m` (2 ≤ m ≤ 50) and a list of `m` integers `arr` (0 ≤ arr_i ≤ 99). For each test case, it checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing at most one operation: replacing an element with its digits in increasing order followed by the element itself. If the list can be made non-decreasing, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variable `n` will be unchanged, and the variables `m`, `arr`, and `ans` will have their final values from the last iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted initially.
   - It then iterates over the array from the last element to the second element (i.e., from index `m-1` to `1`).
   - For each element, if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`, it checks if the previous element can be split into its digits to make the array sorted.
   - The digits of `arr[i-1]` are extracted and combined with `arr[i]` to form a new list `nums`.
   - The list `nums` is then checked if it is sorted. If it is not sorted, the function sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the array can be made sorted, the previous element `arr[i-1]` is replaced with the first digit of `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the function prints `YES` if `ans` is `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Issues and Analysis:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Insertion**:
  - The function attempts to split `arr[i-1]` into its digits and combine them with `arr[i]` to form `nums`.
  - However, the logic for splitting and inserting the digits is flawed. The digits should be inserted in the same position as the original element, not combined with the next element.
  - For example, if `arr = [12, 3, 45, 67]`, and we split `12` into `[1, 2]`, the array should become `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, not `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]`.

- **Sorting Check**:
  - The function checks if `nums` is sorted, but this is not the correct way to determine if the array can be made sorted by the given operation.
  - The correct approach would be to check if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to elements that are out of order.

### Correct Approach:
- **Correct Splitting**:
  - When an element is split, its digits should be inserted in the same position as the original element.
- **Correct Sorting Check**:
  - The function should check if the array can be made sorted by repeatedly applying the operation to elements that are out of order.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to split elements and check if the array can be made sorted. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
