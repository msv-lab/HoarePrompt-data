### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The list `nums` is initialized with the first 21 powers of 2: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20]`. This list has 21 elements, and it ensures that any number from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\) can be represented as a sum of a subsequence of `nums` (since these are the binary representations of numbers).

2. **Finding the Index**:
   - The program iterates through `nums` to find the largest index `idx` such that `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `k`. This is done to ensure that the removed element is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The element `1 << idx` (which is \(2^{\text{idx}}\)) is removed from `nums`.
   - Three new elements are added to `nums`: `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - The purpose of these additions is to ensure that:
     - No subsequence of `nums` sums to `k` (since `k - nums[idx]` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are not powers of 2 and `k + 1` is not a power of 2 either).
     - All other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can still be formed by the elements in `nums`.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed, which is 24.
   - The elements of the modified `nums` list are printed.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Condition 1: No subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`**:
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`, the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`. The removed element `1 << idx` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and the new elements are chosen such that they cannot form `k` with any other elements in `nums`.

- **Condition 2: For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`**:
  - The remaining elements in `nums` are still powers of 2, and the new elements `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are chosen to ensure that all other sums from 1 to `n` can be formed. Specifically:
    - `k - nums[idx]` ensures that sums close to `k` can be formed.
    - `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed.
  - The original powers of 2 in `nums` can form any sum up to \(2^{21} - 1\), and the new elements fill in the gaps to ensure all sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` to be formed.

### Correctness:
**True**
