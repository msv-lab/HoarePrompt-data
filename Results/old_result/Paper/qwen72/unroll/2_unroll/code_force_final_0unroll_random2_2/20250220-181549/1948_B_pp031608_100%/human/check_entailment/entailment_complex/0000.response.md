Reasoning:

The program is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves an integer `m` and a list of `m` integers `arr`. The goal is to determine if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by performing the specified operation any number of times.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**:
   - The program attempts to replace an element with its digits and then checks if the resulting list is sorted. However, the operation described in the problem statement involves removing an element that is at least 10 and inserting its digits in the same position, not appending the element itself after the digits.
   - The line `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` is incorrect because it appends the original element `arr[i]` to the list of digits, which is not what the problem statement requires.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Non-decreasing Order**:
   - The program checks if the list `nums` (which is the list of digits plus the original element) is sorted. This is not the correct approach because the operation should only replace the element with its digits, and the list should be checked for non-decreasing order after the operation.
   - The correct approach would be to replace the element with its digits and then check if the entire list `arr` is non-decreasing.

### Correct Approach:
- For each element in the list that is at least 10, replace it with its digits.
- After all replacements, check if the list is non-decreasing.
- If the list is non-decreasing, print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        # Replace elements that are at least 10 with their digits
        for i in range(m):
            if arr[i] >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                arr[i:i+1] = digits  # Replace the element with its digits
        
        # Check if the array is non-decreasing
        ans = all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `n`, and for each test case, it reads the integer `m` and the list `arr`.
- **Element Replacement**: For each element in `arr` that is at least 10, it is replaced with its digits. This is done using list slicing to insert the digits in place of the original element.
- **Non-decreasing Check**: After all replacements, the function checks if the list `arr` is non-decreasing using the `all` function and a generator expression.
- **Output**: The function prints 'YES' if the list is non-decreasing, and 'NO' otherwise.

### Conclusion:
The original program does not correctly implement the operation described in the problem statement, and its logic for checking the non-decreasing order is flawed. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
