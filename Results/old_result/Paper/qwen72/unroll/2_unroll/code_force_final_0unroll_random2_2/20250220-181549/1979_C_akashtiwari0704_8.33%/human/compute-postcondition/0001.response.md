The only objects in the loop head are the variables `T` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, and `T` is not yet defined. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `T` should start from 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
