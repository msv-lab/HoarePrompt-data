### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The desktop consists of screens, each with a grid of size 5x3, which means each screen has 15 cells.
   - There are two types of icons: 1x1 (occupies 1 cell) and 2x2 (occupies 4 cells).
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `a` and 2x2 icons `b`.
   - It initializes `t` with the number of 2x2 icons `b`.
   - It then calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons:
     - If `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`.
     - If `b` is odd, `t` is set to `b // 2 + 1`.
   - This calculation is correct because each screen can fit 3 icons of size 2x2 (since 15 cells / 4 cells per 2x2 icon = 3.75, which means 3 icons per screen).

3. **Calculating Remaining Cells:**
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons: `t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - This formula is mathematically correct and equivalent to `t * 15 - (b * 4)`.
   - `t1` represents the number of remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons.

4. **Placing 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining cells `t1` are greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons `a`, then no additional screens are needed.
   - Otherwise, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons:
     - `t2 = a - t1` calculates the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the current screens.
     - If `t2` is a multiple of 15, it adds `t2 // 15` screens.
     - If `t2` is not a multiple of 15, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the remaining icons.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Issues:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the handling of the case where `b` is zero. However, the program does not need to initialize `t` with `b` and then adjust it based on the parity of `b`. Instead, `t` should be directly calculated as `b // 3` (since each screen can fit 3 icons of size 2x2).
- The formula `t * 15 - b * 4` is correct and does not need to be changed to `t * 15 - (b * 4)` because the multiplication and subtraction operations are already correctly ordered.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = (b + 2) // 3  # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4  # Calculate remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1  # Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that cannot fit in the current screens
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        print(t)
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization of `t`:** The original program initializes `t` with `b` and then adjusts it based on the parity of `b`. This is unnecessary and can be simplified. The correct way to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is `t = (b + 2) // 3`. This formula ensures that if `b` is zero, `t` is zero, and if `b` is 1 or 2, `t` is 1, and so on.
- **Remaining Cells Calculation:** The formula `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct and does not need to be changed.
- **Handling 1x1 Icons:** The logic for handling 1x1 icons is correct. If the remaining cells `t1` are sufficient, no additional screens are needed. Otherwise, the program correctly calculates the additional screens required.

### Conclusion:
The original program has a logical issue with the initialization of `t` when `b` is zero. The corrected program handles this case correctly and should work as expected for all valid inputs.

Final: **False** (due to the handling of the case where `b` is zero)
