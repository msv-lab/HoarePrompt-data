You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = input().split()
        
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        
        suma = 0
        
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` remains an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` remains a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `numCases` is an input integer, and `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of pairs of integers from the input list for each case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a list of 2n integers. It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list and prints this sum. After processing all test cases, the function terminates. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The state of the program variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remains unchanged, as they are not modified within the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `numCases`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `numInteger` and the list of integers `numbers`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the smallest pairs are always considered first, which is necessary to maximize the score.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a variable `suma` to 0 to keep track of the score.
   - It then enters a loop where it repeatedly pops the first two elements from the sorted list, converts them to integers, and adds the minimum of these two elements to the score.
   - The use of `min(a, b)` is correct because it always adds the smaller of the two chosen numbers to the score, which is the requirement of the problem.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop continues until the list `numbers` is empty, which ensures that exactly `n` moves are performed (since `2n` integers are initially provided and two are removed per move).

5. **Output**:
   - After the loop, the program prints the final score `suma` for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Type Conversion**: The program converts the input numbers to integers only when they are popped from the list. This is correct but can be optimized by converting them to integers immediately after reading the input.
- **List Modification**: The program modifies the list `numbers` in place by using `pop(0)`, which is inefficient for large lists. A more efficient approach would be to use a different method to pair the numbers, such as slicing the sorted list.

### Optimized Version:
```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = sum(numbers[::2])
        print(suma)
```

### Explanation of the Optimized Version:
- **Type Conversion**: The `map(int, input().split())` function converts the input numbers to integers immediately.
- **Efficient Summation**: The `numbers[::2]` slice selects every second element from the sorted list, starting from the first element. This is equivalent to selecting the minimum of each pair in the sorted list.
- **Summation**: The `sum(numbers[::2])` function calculates the sum of these selected elements, which is the maximum score.

### Conclusion:
The original program is correct in terms of logic and output, but it can be optimized for better performance. However, for the given constraints (up to 5000 test cases and up to 100 integers per test case), the original program will still produce the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
