You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains a dictionary with keys 'params' and 'array', where 'params' is a tuple of three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and 'array' is a list of `n` integers. The function processes each test case to count the number of "beautiful pairs" in the list `a`. A "beautiful pair" is defined as a pair of numbers in `a` where the first number can be incremented by some integer to make it divisible by `x` and the second number is already divisible by `y`. The function returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the condition where `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. The current logic in the program only checks if the pair `(a_i, a_j)` satisfies the condition `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i % y == a_j % y`. However, it does not correctly account for the possibility that `a_i - a_j` could be divisible by `y` even if `a_i % y != a_j % y`.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 4, x = 3, y = 2, a = [1, 3, 5, 7]
```
Here, the pairs are:
- \langle 1, 3 \rangle: \(a_1 + a_3 = 1 + 5 = 6\) (6 is divisible by 3) and \(a_1 - a_3 = 1 - 5 = -4\) (-4 is divisible by 2).
- \langle 2, 4 \rangle: \(a_2 + a_4 = 3 + 7 = 10\) (10 is not divisible by 3) and \(a_2 - a_4 = 3 - 7 = -4\) (-4 is divisible by 2).

The program will not count the pair \langle 1, 3 \rangle as beautiful because it only checks if `a_i % y == a_j % y`, which is not true for this pair. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
