Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9, `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`, `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from 0 to n-1.**
