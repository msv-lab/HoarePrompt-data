### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and then iterates `t` times, reading the board dimensions `h`, `w` and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, `yb` for each test case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The function first checks if `xa > xb`. If this is true, it immediately prints "Draw". This is correct because if Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, neither can reach the other's position without going out of bounds, leading to a draw.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The function calculates the distance `x` between Alice's and Bob's chips as `abs(xa - xb) // 2`. This is the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet if they move optimally.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Alice's chip can potentially meet Bob's chip.
   - It then checks if Alice's chip can move to a position within this range in `x + 1` moves. If so, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - This is correct because if the distance is odd, Alice will always have the last move, and she can win if she can move to a position where Bob's chip will be.

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If the distance `abs(xa - xb)` is even, the function calculates the range of columns `l` and `r` where Bob's chip can potentially meet Alice's chip.
   - It then checks if Bob's chip can move to a position within this range in `x` moves. If so, it prints "Bob"; otherwise, it prints "Draw".
   - This is correct because if the distance is even, Bob will have the last move, and he can win if he can move to a position where Alice's chip will be.

6. **Boundary Conditions**: The function correctly handles the boundary conditions by using `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)` to ensure that the calculated positions do not go out of bounds.

7. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is either "Draw", "Alice", or "Bob". This matches the expected output format.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly handles the problem description and the given constraints. It evaluates the game state for each test case and prints the appropriate result based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
