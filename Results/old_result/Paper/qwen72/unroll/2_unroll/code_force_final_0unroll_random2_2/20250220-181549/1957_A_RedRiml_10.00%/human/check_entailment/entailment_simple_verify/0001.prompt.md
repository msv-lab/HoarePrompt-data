You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        print(shapes)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        pl = []
        
        d = {}
        
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        
        shapes = 0
        
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += 1
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. The value of `w` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed. The loop prints the number of unique integers in each list `palka` that appear at least 3 times, for each of the `w` iterations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`w`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`ln`) and the lengths of the sticks (`palka`).

2. **Frequency Counting:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Shape Counting:**
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length, it checks if there are at least 3 sticks of that length (`if d[j] >= 3`).
   - If there are, it increments the `shapes` counter by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of shapes for each test case.

### Issues:

1. **Incorrect Shape Counting:**
   - The program assumes that any stick length that appears at least 3 times can form a regular polygon. This is incorrect because a regular polygon can have more than 3 sides.
   - For example, a square requires 4 sticks of the same length, a pentagon requires 5 sticks, and so on.
   - The program should check for the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed, not just if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length.

2. **Optimal Shape Counting:**
   - The program should consider the number of sides required for each polygon and try to form as many polygons as possible with the available sticks.
   - For example, if there are 8 sticks of length 3, it should form 2 squares (each requiring 4 sticks) instead of just 1 shape.

### Corrected Approach:

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Stick Length:**
   - Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each stick length.

2. **Determine the Maximum Number of Regular Polygons:**
   - For each unique stick length, determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed with that length.
   - A regular polygon with `k` sides requires `k` sticks of the same length.
   - The maximum number of polygons that can be formed with `d[j]` sticks of length `j` is `d[j] // k` for each `k` from 3 to `d[j]`.

3. **Sum the Maximum Number of Polygons:**
   - Sum the maximum number of polygons for each unique stick length to get the total number of polygons.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not consider the number of sides required for each polygon and only checks if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length. This can lead to incorrect results, especially when there are enough sticks to form multiple polygons of the same type.
