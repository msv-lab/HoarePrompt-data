Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than \(d\). The function `func_1` incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost for each cell can be calculated by only considering the previous \(d+1\) cells, which does not account for the correct distance constraint between supports.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 1 2
0 1 0 1 0
0 2 2 2 0
0 3 3 3 0
```
The correct output should be 4, as the minimum cost of building a bridge in the first row is 4 (installing supports at columns 1, 3, and 5). However, the program will output 6, because it incorrectly calculates the minimum cost for the middle cells without considering the correct distance constraint.

To correctly solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach or a more sophisticated algorithm is needed to ensure that the distance constraint is met.
