The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a binary string. The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts a binary string `s` (2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5) consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of the lengths of all binary strings across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the result for each test case, which is not specified in the provided information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and multiple binary strings `s` for each test case. It returns a result for each binary string, but the specific output for each case is not provided.**
