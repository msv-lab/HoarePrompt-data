Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function `I` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The function `R` is now defined as a lambda function that reads an integer from the input. The initial state conditions remain unchanged: the input is a sequence of test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and the function can make at most 3n queries to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for kp in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    g = 0
    v1 = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        v2 = i
        print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input('')
        if r == '<':
            v1 = v2
    prev = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
        sys.stdout.flush()
        r = input()
        if r == '>':
            prev = i
    print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
    sys.stdout.flush()


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
