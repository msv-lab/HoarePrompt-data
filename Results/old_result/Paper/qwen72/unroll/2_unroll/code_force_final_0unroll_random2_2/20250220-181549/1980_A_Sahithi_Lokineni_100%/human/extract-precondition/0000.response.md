Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: a list of integers representing the number of problems of each difficulty level (A to G) and an integer m representing the number of rounds. The list should have exactly 7 elements, each non-negative, and m should be a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def min_problems_needed(n, m, a):
```

With the correct function definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n containing characters from 'A' to 'G'.**
