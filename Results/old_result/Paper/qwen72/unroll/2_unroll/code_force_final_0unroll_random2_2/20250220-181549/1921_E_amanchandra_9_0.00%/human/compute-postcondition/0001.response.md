Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the conditions provided in the loop. The values of `h`, `w`, `xa`, `ya`, `xb`, and `yb` will be read from input for each iteration, and the loop will continue to the next test case until all `t` test cases have been processed. The final state of the loop will be that all `t` test cases have been evaluated and the corresponding results printed.**
