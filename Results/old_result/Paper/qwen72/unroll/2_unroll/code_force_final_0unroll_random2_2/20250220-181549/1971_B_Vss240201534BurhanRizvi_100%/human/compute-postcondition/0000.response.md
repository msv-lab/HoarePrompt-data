To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` returns a positive integer. Given the task description, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer within this range.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must return a positive integer `t` such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
