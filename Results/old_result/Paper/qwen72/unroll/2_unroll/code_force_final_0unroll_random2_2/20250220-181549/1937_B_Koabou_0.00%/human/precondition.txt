The function `solve` is part of a program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) and two binary strings of length `n` representing the rows of a 2×n grid. The function should handle the input and output for each test case, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
