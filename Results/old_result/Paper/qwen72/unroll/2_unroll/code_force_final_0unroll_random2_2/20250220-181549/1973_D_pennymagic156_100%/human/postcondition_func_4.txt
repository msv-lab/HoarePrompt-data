The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It interacts with external functions `func_3` and `func_2` to determine a specific value `v` and then performs a series of queries. If a suitable value `v` is found, it prints a final result of the form `! {i * v}` where `i` is a multiple of `v` that satisfies certain conditions. If no suitable value is found, it prints `! -1`. The function always ends by calling `func_2()`.
