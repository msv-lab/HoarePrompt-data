Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell, given the initial configuration of the grid. The grid is represented by a string `s1` of characters '<' and '>', and the pinball's movement is determined by these characters, with the grid being updated after each move.

### Function Analysis:

1. **`func_1(arr, times)`**:
   - This function calculates the difference between the last element of `arr` and the element at the index `max(-n, -1 - times)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
   - It is used to compute the cumulative sums of indices in `func_2`.

2. **`func_2(s1, n)`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.
   - It uses two lists, `preOne` and `suffZero`, to keep track of the cumulative sums of indices where the characters are '>' and '<' respectively.
   - The function iterates over the string from right to left, updating the cumulative sums and calculating the time for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - The logic inside the loop adjusts the time based on the number of '>' and '<' characters encountered and their positions.

### Verification of the Solution:

- **Initialization**:
  - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
  - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
  - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of indices of '>' characters.
  - `suffZero` is initialized to `[0]` and will be used to store the cumulative sum of indices of '<' characters.

- **Loop**:
  - The loop iterates from the last cell to the first cell.
  - If the current cell contains '>', the function calculates the time to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and the number of '>' and '<' characters.
  - If the current cell contains '<', the function updates the cumulative sum of '<' indices and calculates the time to leave the grid similarly.

- **Output**:
  - The function prints the list `ans`, which contains the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

### Correctness Check:

- **Handling of '<' and '>'**:
  - The function correctly handles the movement of the pinball based on the direction indicated by the character in the current cell.
  - The cumulative sums are used to efficiently calculate the time to leave the grid, considering the inversion of the characters after each move.

- **Boundary Conditions**:
  - The function ensures that the pinball leaves the grid within a finite number of steps, as required by the problem.
  - The use of `max(-n, -1 - times)` in `func_1` ensures that the index is within the bounds of the list.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of cumulative sums and the loop structure ensures that the function runs efficiently, meeting the constraints of the problem (1 ≤ n ≤ 5 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:

The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell, considering the inversion of the characters after each move. The logic and the use of cumulative sums are appropriate for the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
