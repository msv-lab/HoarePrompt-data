#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers representing the number of problems of each difficulty level (A to G) and an integer m representing the number of rounds. The list should have exactly 7 elements, each non-negative, and m should be a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and always returns 0. It does not modify any input variables or perform any actions other than returning the integer 0.
