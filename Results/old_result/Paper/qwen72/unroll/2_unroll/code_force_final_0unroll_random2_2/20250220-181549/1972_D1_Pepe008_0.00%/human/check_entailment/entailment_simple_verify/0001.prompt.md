You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Initial Code Analysis:**
   - The initial code snippet contains a commented-out block of code that seems to be a brute-force approach to solving the problem.
   - The actual implementation uses a more optimized approach.

3. **Optimized Approach:**
   - The code iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(b\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) using the formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
   - It then checks if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) and adds \(x\) to the sum if the condition is true.
   - Finally, it prints the sum minus 1.

4. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as:
     \[
     a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \quad \text{for some integer } k
     \]
   - This implies:
     \[
     a = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)
     \]
   - For \(a\) to be a valid integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be a non-negative integer, and \(a\) must be within the range \([1, n]\).

5. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values for a given \(i\).
   - The term \(i \cdot (i - 1)\) is subtracted from \(a\) to account for the offset.
   - The division by \(i^2\) and adding 1 is used to count the number of valid \(a\) values.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code subtracts 1 from the final sum before printing. This is necessary because the formula might count an extra pair that is not valid.
   - The condition \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) ensures that \(a\) is positive and within the range.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases.
   - The formula used is derived from the problem's mathematical condition and seems to be correct.
   - The edge case handling (subtracting 1 from the final sum) is also appropriate.

### Conclusion:
The given program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and the mathematical insights. The formula and the logic used in the code are aligned with the problem's requirements.
