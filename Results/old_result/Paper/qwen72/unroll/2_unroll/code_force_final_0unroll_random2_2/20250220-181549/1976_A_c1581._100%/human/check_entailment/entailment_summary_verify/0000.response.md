Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct. The function `func_1` does not properly enforce the condition that no digit should come after a letter. Let's break down the function and the problem requirements to understand why:

1. **Separation of Digits and Letters**:
   - The function correctly separates the digits and letters into two lists, `digits` and `letters`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The function sorts both `digits` and `letters` lists. This ensures that the digits and letters within their respective lists are in non-decreasing order.

3. **Validation of Sorted Digits and Letters**:
   - The function checks if the sorted `digits` list is in non-decreasing order.
   - The function also checks if the largest digit is greater than any of the letters. This is intended to ensure that no digit comes after a letter, but it is not sufficient.

4. **Concatenation and Final Check**:
   - The function concatenates the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists into `sortedPassword`.
   - It then checks if `sortedPassword` is equal to the original `password`.

The issue lies in the validation step. The function only checks if the largest digit is greater than any of the letters, which is not enough to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. It should instead check the order of characters in the original `password` to ensure that no digit follows a letter.

**Example of a Case Where the Program Fails**:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  123ac
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

In this example, the password "123ac" has digits followed by letters, which violates the condition that no digit should come after a letter. However, the function `func_1` does not detect this and incorrectly returns "YES".

**Corrected Function**:
To correctly handle the condition, the function should check the order of characters in the original `password` to ensure that no digit follows a letter. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    has_letter = False
    has_digit = False
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            has_digit = True
            if has_letter:
                return False
        else:
            has_letter = True
        if has_digit and char.isalpha():
            return False
    digits = [char for char in password if char.isdigit()]
    letters = [char for char in password if char.isalpha()]
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    return True
```

This corrected function:
- Uses flags `has_letter` and `has_digit` to track the presence of letters and digits.
- Ensures that no digit follows a letter by checking the flags.
- Sorts and compares the `digits` and `letters` lists to ensure they are in non-decreasing order.

**Final Evaluation**:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program is incorrect because it does not properly enforce the condition that no digit should come after a letter.

Final: **False**
