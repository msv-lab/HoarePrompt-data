Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to understand what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `n` is equal to `r[0]`.
- `m` is equal to `r[1]`.
- `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`.
- `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number.
- `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
- If `y2` <= `y1`, then:
  - `y1` is `r[3] - 1`.
  - `y2` is 1.
  - `a` is 0.
  - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
  - `c` is `y1 - 1`.
- Otherwise, if `y2` > `y1`, then:
  - `y1` is `r[3] + 1 + a`.
  - `y2` is equal to `m`.
  - `a` is `r[1] - y2`.
  - `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
  - `c` is `m - y1`.
- The current value of `b // 2` is greater than `a`.
- The absolute difference between `x2` and `c` is greater than or equal to `x1 + c`.
- `y1` is between 1 and `m` (inclusive).
- `x1` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive).

### Analysis:
1. **Variables and Conditions:**
   - `n` and `m` are derived from the list `r`.
   - `x1` and `x2` are derived from `r` and `a`.
   - `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
   - The conditions ensure that `x2` is greater than `x1` and the difference is even.
   - The conditions also ensure that `b // 2` is greater than `a`.
   - The conditions involving `y1` and `y2` determine their values based on the comparison of `y2` and `y1`.
   - `t` and `c` are derived from the values of `y1` and `y2`.

2. **Print Statement:**
   - The `print` statement is simply `print('Alice')`.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement does not depend on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string 'Alice'.

### Final Output:
Output: **Alice**
