- The algorithm correctly identifies the number of 0s and 1s and calculates the cost of moving 0s past 1s.
  - The logic of adding 1 to `ans` when a 0 is encountered and there are 1s before it, and adding the difference between total 0s and encountered 0s when a 1 is encountered, is correct for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts on substrings. The algorithm is efficient and handles the constraints specified in the problem.

Correctness:
