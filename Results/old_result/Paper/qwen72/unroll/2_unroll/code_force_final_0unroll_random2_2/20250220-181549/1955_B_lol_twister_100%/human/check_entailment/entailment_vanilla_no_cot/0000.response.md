Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Matrix Construction**: The function `func_1` constructs the progressive square based on the given rules:
   - It finds the minimum value `a` in the array `l`, which corresponds to `a_{1,1}`.
   - It then generates the elements of the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for each element in the matrix, where `k` and `h` are the row and column indices, respectively.
3. **Comparison**: The program sorts both the constructed list `li` and the input list `l` and compares them to check if they are identical.
4. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" if the lists match, indicating that the elements can form the progressive square, and "NO" otherwise.

The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements, ensuring that the program correctly determines whether the given array elements can form the specified progressive square.
