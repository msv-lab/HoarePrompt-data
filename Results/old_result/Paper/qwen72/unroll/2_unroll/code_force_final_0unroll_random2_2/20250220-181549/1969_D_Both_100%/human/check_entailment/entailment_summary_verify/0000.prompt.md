You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It performs a series of operations to determine and print the maximum profit that can be achieved for each of `test_cases` test cases. Each test case involves selecting `k` items from a list of `n` items, where each item has a price and a bonus. The function initializes and manipulates internal variables such as `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` within each test case. After processing each test case, the final `max_profit` is printed, and the internal variables are reset for the next test case. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from working correctly in all potential cases:

1. **Input Reading Function (`read_input`)**: The program uses a function `read_input()` to read input, but this function is not defined in the provided code. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.

2. **Handling of `heap` and `remaining_items`**: The program uses a heap to manage the items that Bob will take for free. However, the logic for pushing and popping items from the heap is flawed. Specifically, the line `current_profit -= item[1]` is incorrect because it subtracts the bonus (which should be added to the profit if the item is not taken by Bob).

3. **Incorrect Calculation of `current_profit`**: The program calculates `current_profit` in a way that does not correctly account for the profit when Bob takes items for free. The logic for updating `current_profit` when items are pushed and popped from the heap is not consistent with the problem description.

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is 0 or `n` is 1 correctly. For example, if `k` is 0, Bob should take all items for free, and Alice's profit should be 0. If `n` is 1, the program should handle the single item case correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
1 0
1
1
```
Expected Output:
```
0
```
Actual Output:
The program will raise a `NameError` because `read_input` is not defined.

Even if `read_input` were defined, the logic for updating `current_profit` would still be incorrect, leading to potential incorrect outputs for other test cases.
