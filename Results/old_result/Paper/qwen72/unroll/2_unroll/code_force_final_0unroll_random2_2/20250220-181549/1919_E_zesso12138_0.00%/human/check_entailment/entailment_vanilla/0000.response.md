### Reasoning

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a sorted prefix sum array `p` of a hidden array `a` consisting only of 1 and -1.
   - We need to count the number of possible arrays `a` that could result in the given `p` after sorting.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `j - offset` using the first `i` elements of the array `a`.
   - `offset` is used to handle negative indices by shifting the range of possible prefix sums to be non-negative.
   - The initial state `dp[offset] = 1` represents that there is one way to have a prefix sum of 0 (using no elements).

3. **Transition**:
   - For each element in the array `a`, we update the `dp` array to account for the new possible prefix sums.
   - If the current prefix sum is `j`, then the next prefix sum can be `j + 1` (if the next element is 1) or `j - 1` (if the next element is -1).
   - We update the `new_dp` array accordingly and take modulo `MOD` to handle large numbers.

4. **Final State**:
   - After processing all elements, the final prefix sum should be `p[-1]`.
   - We return `dp[final_sum]` where `final_sum = p[-1] + offset`.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_2` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into a list of integers and iterates through the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the size `n` and the prefix sum array `p`, then calls `func_1` to get the result.
   - The results are collected in a list and printed one by one.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n = 1` and `p = [0]` by returning 0.
   - It also handles the case where `n = 1` and `p = [1]` or `p = [-1]` by returning 1.
   - The program ensures that the prefix sums are within the valid range by using the `offset`.

7. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the result does not exceed `998244353`.

The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and handles the input and output as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
