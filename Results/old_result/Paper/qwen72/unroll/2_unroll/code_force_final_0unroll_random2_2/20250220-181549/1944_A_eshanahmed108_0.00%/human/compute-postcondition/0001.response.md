Output State: The loop will execute for the number of test cases specified by the input. For each test case, given the values of `n` and `k`, the output will be `n` if `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, otherwise, the output will be `1`. The variables `n` and `k` will be updated with new values for each iteration, but their final values after the loop will be the last values read from the input. The function `func` remains incomplete and does not affect the loop execution.
