### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and the signs must occur sequentially.
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a list of periodicities for the signs.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function `func_1` is designed to handle a path string, which is not relevant to the problem of calculating the year of the n-th sign of the apocalypse.
     - The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum number of '@' characters that can be collected while avoiding '*' characters. This is completely unrelated to the problem statement.
     - The function does not use the periodicities of the signs and does not calculate the year of the n-th sign.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
     - It calls `func_1` with a string `path`, which is supposed to be the list of periodicities but is treated as a string.
     - The function does not correctly interpret the input as periodicities and instead treats it as a string, which is incorrect for the problem.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The input is expected to be a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - The program incorrectly treats this list as a string and passes it to `func_1`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program is supposed to output the year in which the n-th sign will occur.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` does not produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - The annotations describe the state of the program as if `path` is a list of strings where each string is either '@' or '*'. This is not aligned with the problem description, which expects a list of integers.
  - The function `func_1` is designed to solve a different problem (maximizing the number of '@' characters in a path while avoiding '*') and does not address the periodicity of signs.
  - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is not relevant to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign.

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
  - It incorrectly interprets the input as a string and passes it to `func_1`.
  - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program, but the state is not relevant to the problem of calculating the year of the n-th sign.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. It uses a completely different approach (dynamic programming for a path string) and does not handle the periodicities of the signs correctly. The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
