Output State: The `info` list remains unchanged, containing `cases` sublists, each of which is a sorted list of three integers. The `cases` variable also remains unchanged. The loop prints a string for each sublist in `info`, where each string consists of three lowercase Latin letters corresponding to the positions in the sublist. The sum of the positions in each sublist equals the original `lex` value.
