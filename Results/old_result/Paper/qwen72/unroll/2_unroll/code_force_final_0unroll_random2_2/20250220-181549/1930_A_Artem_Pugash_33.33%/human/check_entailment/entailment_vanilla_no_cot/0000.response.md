Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Type Conversion for `numbers`**:
   - The `numbers` list is obtained from `input().split()`, which results in a list of strings. However, the program attempts to sort this list and then use the `pop` method to remove elements. The `min` function is applied to these elements, but since they are still strings, the `min` function will not work as intended. It will compare the strings lexicographically, not numerically.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the `numbers` list in ascending order, which is correct for the logic of the problem. However, since the elements are strings, the sorting will be based on lexicographic order, not numerical order.

3. **Correct Logic**:
   - The logic of the program is to sort the numbers and then repeatedly take the two smallest numbers, add the smaller one to the score, and remove both. This approach is correct in theory, but it fails due to the type conversion issue.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issues, you need to convert the elements of the `numbers` list to integers before sorting and processing them. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Convert to integers
        numbers.sort()  # Sort in ascending order
        suma = 0
        while numbers:
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Type Conversion**: `list(map(int, input().split()))` converts the input string into a list of integers.
- **Sorting**: `numbers.sort()` sorts the list of integers in ascending order.
- **Processing**: The `while numbers` loop continues until the list is empty. In each iteration, it pops the two smallest elements, adds the smaller one to the score, and continues.

This corrected program will now correctly compute the maximum final score for each test case.
