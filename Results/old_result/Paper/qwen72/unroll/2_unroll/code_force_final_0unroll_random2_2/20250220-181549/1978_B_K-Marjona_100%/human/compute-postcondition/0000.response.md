The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` do not directly affect the loop head, but they are part of the initial state and should be mentioned.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
