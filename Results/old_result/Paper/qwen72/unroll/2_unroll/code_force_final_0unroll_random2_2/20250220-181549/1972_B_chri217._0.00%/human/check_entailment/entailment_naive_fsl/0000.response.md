Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are only two coins left, and one of them is facing up. According to the problem description, if there are only two coins left, one will be removed and the other won't be flipped. However, the function `func_1` only checks the parity of the number of facing-up coins and does not account for the specific rules when there are only two coins left. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
2
UD
```
The program will output "NO" because there is an even number of 'U' coins. However, Alice can win by removing the 'U' coin, leaving the 'D' coin, and Bob will have no move, thus Alice wins. The correct output should be "YES".
