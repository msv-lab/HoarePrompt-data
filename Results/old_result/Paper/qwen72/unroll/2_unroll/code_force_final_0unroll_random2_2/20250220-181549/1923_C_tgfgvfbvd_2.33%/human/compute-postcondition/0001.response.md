Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations. The variables `n`, `m`, `l`, `p`, `a`, `b`, and `c` have been updated and used during the execution of the loop, but their final values are not retained for the next test case. The loop processes each test case independently, and the output for each query is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
