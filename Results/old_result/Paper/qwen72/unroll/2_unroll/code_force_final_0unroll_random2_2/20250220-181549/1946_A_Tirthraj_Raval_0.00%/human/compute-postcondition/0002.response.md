The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used within the loop, but it will be assigned values from 0 to `t-1` as the loop iterates.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `_` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be set by the loop itself.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
