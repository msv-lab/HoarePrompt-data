Output State: **`results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs for each test case in `test_cases`. The length of `results` is equal to `t`. The `freq` dictionary and `beautiful_count` variable are reset for each test case, so they do not retain values between different test cases.**
