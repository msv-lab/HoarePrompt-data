Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of n characters where each character is from 'A' to 'G'. The loop has printed the value of `ans` for each iteration, where `ans` is the number of characters in the string `p` ('ABCDEF') that are either not present in `s` or have a frequency less than `m` in `s`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `s` are reinitialized in each iteration, and `a` remains unchanged.**
