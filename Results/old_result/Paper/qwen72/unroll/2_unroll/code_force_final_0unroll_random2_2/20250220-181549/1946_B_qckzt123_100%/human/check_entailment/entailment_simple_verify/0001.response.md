### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and the inputs for each test case, including the length of the array `n`, the number of operations `k`, and the array `a` itself.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `s` of the array `a` is correctly calculated using `sum(a)`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The program uses a sliding window approach to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray. This is a correct implementation of Kadane's algorithm, which is efficient and appropriate for this problem. The variable `tmp` keeps track of the current subarray sum, and `t` keeps track of the maximum subarray sum found so far. Resetting `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative ensures that only positive contributions are considered, which is essential for maximizing the sum.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. This ensures that the result is non-negative and within the modulo range. The addition of `MOD` and the subsequent modulo operation is a standard technique to handle negative results and ensure the final answer is within the valid range.

5. **Operations Loop:**
   - The loop correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for `k - 1` operations and adds it to the answer `ans`, taking modulo `MOD` at each step to prevent overflow. This is the correct approach to simulate the operations as described in the problem.

6. **Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where the array contains only negative numbers by resetting `tmp` to 0 when it becomes negative. This ensures that the maximum subarray sum `t` is 0, which is the correct behavior.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where `k` is 1, as it only adds the maximum subarray sum once.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State Before Function Call:**
  - `T` is an integer where \(1 \le T \le 10^4\).
  - `n` and `k` are integers where \(1 \le n, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9\).
  - The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

- **State After Sum Calculation:**
  - `s` is the sum of the array `a`.

- **State After Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
  - `t` is the maximum subarray sum found in `a`.
  - `tmp` is the running sum used to calculate `t`.

- **State After Initial Answer Calculation:**
  - `ans` is the initial answer, which is the sum of `s` and `t` modulo `MOD`.

- **State After Operations Loop:**
  - `t` is doubled and added to `ans` for `k - 1` operations, with modulo `MOD` applied at each step.

- **Final State:**
  - The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It follows the steps of summing the array, finding the maximum subarray sum, and performing the operations to maximize the sum of the array, all while taking the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The annotations confirm that the program maintains the correct state at each key point, and the operations are performed as intended.
