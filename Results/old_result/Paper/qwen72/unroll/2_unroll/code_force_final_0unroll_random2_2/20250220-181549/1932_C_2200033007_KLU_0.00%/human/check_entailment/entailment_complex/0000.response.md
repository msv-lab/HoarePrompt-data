Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The main issue lies in how the program calculates the remainder of the product of the elements in the array `a` before each removal, and how it processes the commands.

1. **Product Calculation Before Removal**:
   - The problem requires that, for each command, the program outputs the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` before the command is executed.
   - The program, however, appends elements to `b` in the order they are removed from `a` and then calculates the cumulative product of these elements in reverse order. This does not match the problem's requirement, which is to calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` before each removal.

2. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cumulative product of elements in `b` (which are the elements removed from `a`), but it does not take the remainder of this product with `m` at each step.
   - The problem requires the remainder of the product of the elements in `a` before each removal, not the cumulative product of removed elements.

3. **Final Output**:
   - The program returns the cumulative products in reverse order, which is not the same as the remainders of the products of the elements in `a` before each removal.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Calculate the product of all elements in `a` at the beginning.
- For each command, output the remainder of this product when divided by `m`.
- Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command.
- Update the product by dividing it by the removed element and taking the remainder with `m` for the next command.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
