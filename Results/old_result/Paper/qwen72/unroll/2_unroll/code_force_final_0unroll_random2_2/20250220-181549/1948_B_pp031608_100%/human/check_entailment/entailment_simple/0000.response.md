### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `m` which represents the length of the array `arr`.
   - It then reads `m` integers and stores them in the list `arr`.

2. **Algorithm**:
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `ans` to `True`, assuming the array can be made non-decreasing.
   - It iterates through the array from the last element to the second element (i.e., from index `m-1` to `1`).
   - For each element, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is less than the previous element `arr[i-1]`.
   - If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i-1]`, it splits `arr[i-1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
   - It then checks if the resulting list of digits (plus `arr[i]`) is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If the resulting list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the resulting list is sorted, it updates `arr[i-1]` to the first digit of the split number.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array for a given test case, it prints 'YES' if `ans` is `True` and 'NO' if `ans` is `False`.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Incorrect Splitting and Checking**:
  - The current implementation splits `arr[i-1]` into its digits and appends `arr[i]` to the list of digits. This is incorrect because the operation should replace `arr[i-1]` with its digits, not append `arr[i]` to the list of digits.
  - The correct approach should be to replace `arr[i-1]` with its digits and then check if the array can be made non-decreasing.

- **Correct Implementation**:
  - Instead of appending `arr[i]` to the list of digits, the function should replace `arr[i-1]` with its digits and then check if the array can be made non-decreasing.
  - The function should also handle the case where `arr[i-1]` is less than 10, in which case it cannot be split.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                if arr[i - 1] >= 10:
                    nums = [int(digit) for digit in str(arr[i - 1])]
                    arr[i - 1:i] = nums  # Replace arr[i-1] with its digits
                else:
                    ans = False
                    break
                
                if not all(arr[j] <= arr[j + 1] for j in range(len(arr) - 1)):
                    ans = False
                    break
        
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Splitting and Replacing**:
  - If `arr[i-1]` is greater than or equal to 10, it is split into its digits and the array is updated to replace `arr[i-1]` with these digits.
  - If `arr[i-1]` is less than 10, it cannot be split, and the function sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

- **Checking Non-decreasing Order**:
  - After splitting, the function checks if the array is still in non-decreasing order. If not, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly implement the splitting and checking logic.
- The corrected program is **correct** and should work as expected for the given problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
