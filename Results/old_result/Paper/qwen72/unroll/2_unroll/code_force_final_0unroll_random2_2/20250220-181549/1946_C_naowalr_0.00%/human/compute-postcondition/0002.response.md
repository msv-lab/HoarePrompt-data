Output State: **The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, the variables `n`, `k`, and `adj` have been updated according to the input for that test case, and the final value of `L` for each test case has been printed. The variables `L`, `R`, and `numCuts` have been reset for each test case, and `leftover` is a temporary variable used within the `dfs` function. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged.**
