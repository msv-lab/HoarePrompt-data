The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It then generates a permutation list of length `n` such that for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, the elements at indices `i, i+k, i+2k, ...` (up to the length of the list) are filled with consecutive integers starting from 1. The function prints the elements of this permutation list separated by spaces. After the function concludes, the variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the permutation list is fully populated and printed.
