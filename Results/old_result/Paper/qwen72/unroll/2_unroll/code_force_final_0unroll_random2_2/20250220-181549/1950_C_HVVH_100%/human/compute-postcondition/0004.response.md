The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `s`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and `s` is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59, representing a valid time in 24-hour format. The function returns a new time string in the same "hh:mm" format, which is the result of adding `t` minutes to the time represented by `s`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a string `s` representing a valid time in 24-hour format "hh:mm". It returns a new time string in the same format, which is the result of adding `t` minutes to the time represented by `s`.**
