The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `1`. The initial state describes the context in which this statement is executed, but it does not affect the output of the `print` statement itself.

Initial State:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer.
- `n` is equal to `k`.

Given the initial state, the `print(1)` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, or `k`.

Output: **1**
