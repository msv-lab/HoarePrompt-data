Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1.**

The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of the variable `idx_v`, which is now set to 1. The values of `n` and `k` are still provided by user input, and `permutation` is still a list of `n` zeros. The variable `idx` remains 0.
