Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, and an integer `k`. `a` has length `n`, `b` has length `m`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each element in `a` and `b` is an integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^6. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**
