The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) and converts it to a binary string representation. It then modifies this binary string according to specific rules: it changes certain '1's to '-1's and '0's to '1's, and potentially extends the length of the binary string by one. After processing, it prints the length of the modified binary string and the modified binary digits. The function does not return any value, and the final state of `x` is not preserved. The list `s` contains the modified binary representation of the last input `x` after the function concludes.
