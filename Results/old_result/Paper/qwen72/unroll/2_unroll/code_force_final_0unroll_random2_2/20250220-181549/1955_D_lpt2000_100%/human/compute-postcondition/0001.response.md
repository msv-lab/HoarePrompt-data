The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the integer `nabors`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `nabors`. If `nabors` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted, but it will take on values from 0 to `nabors - 1` during the loop's execution.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nabors` must be greater than 0.

State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0**
