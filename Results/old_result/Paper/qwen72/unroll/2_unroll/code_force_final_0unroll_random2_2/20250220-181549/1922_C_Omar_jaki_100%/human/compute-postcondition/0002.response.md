The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer read from the input. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **`t` is a non-zero integer, `n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `a` is a list of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and each query is a pair of integers (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i. The lambda function `r` is defined and can be used to read multiple integers from a single input line.**
