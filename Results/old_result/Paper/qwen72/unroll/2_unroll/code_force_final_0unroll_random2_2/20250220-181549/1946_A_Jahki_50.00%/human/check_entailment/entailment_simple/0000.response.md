### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(t, test_cases):` where `t` is the number of test cases and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and the list `a`.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases, but the current implementation reads inputs directly from `input()`, which is not ideal for a function that should be reusable and testable.

2. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `num2` (the length of the array) and `case` (the space-separated list of integers).
   - If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify any special handling for large `num2` values, and the break statement will terminate the program prematurely, leaving some test cases unprocessed.

3. **Array Parsing and Sorting**:
   - The array `a` is parsed correctly from the input string `case`.
   - The array `b` is sorted, which is necessary to find the median.

4. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index `ma` is calculated correctly based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - The median value is correctly identified as `b[ma]`.

5. **Operations to Increase Median**:
   - The loop to increase the median value is incorrect. The current implementation increments the value at the median index `b[ma]` and sorts the array again, which is inefficient and unnecessary.
   - The correct approach would be to find the smallest number greater than the current median and increment the necessary elements to reach that value.

6. **Output**:
   - The number of operations is printed correctly for each test case, but the program may break prematurely due to the incorrect handling of large `num2` values.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has several issues that make it incorrect:
- The function definition and input handling do not match the problem description.
- The special handling for `num2 > 10000` is incorrect and unnecessary.
- The loop to increase the median is inefficient and does not correctly handle the minimum number of operations required.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def min_operations_to_increase_median(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n, a = test_cases[i]
        b = sorted(a)
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            ma = n // 2 - 1
        else:
            ma = n // 2
        
        median = b[ma]
        
        # Find the smallest number greater than the current median
        new_median = median + 1
        while new_median not in b:
            new_median += 1
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of operations to increase the median
        op = 0
        for j in range(ma, n):
            if b[j] < new_median:
                op += new_median - b[j]
        
        results.append(op)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
t = 8
test_cases = [
    (3, [2, 2, 8]),
    (4, [7, 3, 3, 1]),
    (1, [1000000000]),
    (5, [5, 5, 5, 4, 5]),
    (6, [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4]),
    (2, [1, 2]),
    (2, [1, 1]),
    (4, [5, 5, 5, 5])
]

min_operations_to_increase_median(t, test_cases)
```

This corrected version properly handles multiple test cases, calculates the median correctly, and efficiently determines the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
