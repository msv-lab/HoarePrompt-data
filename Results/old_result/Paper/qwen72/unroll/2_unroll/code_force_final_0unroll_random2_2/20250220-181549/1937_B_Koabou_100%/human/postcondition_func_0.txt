The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings `a1` and `a2` of length `n` from the input. It then processes these strings to find a specific pattern and prints a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The string `s` is either a concatenation of a prefix of `a1` and a suffix of `a1` and `a2` if a certain condition is met, or it remains as `a1` concatenated with the last character of `a2`. The integer `t` is either the length of the matched substring if a match is found, or 1 if no match is found. The function does not return any values but prints the results directly.
