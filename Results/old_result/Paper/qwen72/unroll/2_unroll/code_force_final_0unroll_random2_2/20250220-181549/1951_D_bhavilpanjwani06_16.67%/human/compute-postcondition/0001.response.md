Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, and the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`.**
