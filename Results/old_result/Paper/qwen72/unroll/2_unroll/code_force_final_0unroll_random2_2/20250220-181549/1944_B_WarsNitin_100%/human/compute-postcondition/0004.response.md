Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves reading two integers `n` and `k` from input, followed by a list `a` of integers of length `2n` where each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice. The function then splits `a` into two halves, sorts each half, and constructs two new lists `ans1` and `ans2` based on the sorted halves and the value of `k`. Specifically, it tries to fill `ans1` and `ans2` with pairs of identical elements from the sorted halves, and if necessary, with unique elements from a temporary list `l`. The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are re-initialized in each iteration, so their values are not retained between iterations. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is the only variable that persists across all iterations. **
