The loop head contains the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be a positive integer. The variable `t` is mentioned as a positive integer, but it is not directly used in the loop head. The variable `n` and list `a` are also mentioned, but they are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer. Since `t` is already a positive integer, it can be inferred that the input should be `t` for the loop to run `t` times.

State: **`_` is not relevant, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
