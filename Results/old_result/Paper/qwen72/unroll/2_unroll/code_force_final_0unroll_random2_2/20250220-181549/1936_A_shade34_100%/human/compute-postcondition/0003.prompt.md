You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and p is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', mak, mak, i, i)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '<':
                mak = i
        
        mak2 = mak
        
        pans = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            print('?', mak, mak2, i, mak2)
            sys.stdout.flush()
            s = str(input())
            if s == '<':
                mak = i
                pans = [i]
            elif s == '=':
                pans.append(i)
        
        mak = 0
        
        for i in range(1, len(pans)):
            print('?', pans[mak], pans[mak], pans[i], pans[i])
            sys.stdout.flush()
            if str(input()) == '>':
                mak = i
        
        print('!', mak2, pans[mak])
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is the last input integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^4, and `p` remains a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The variables `mak`, `mak2`, and `pans` will have been updated based on the inputs and comparisons made during the loop execution, but their exact values depend on the specific inputs and the permutation `p`. Specifically, `mak2` will be the maximum value found in the first part of the loop, and `pans[mak]` will be the maximum value found in the second part of the loop among the elements that are equal to `mak2` in the permutation `p`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, and `p` is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
