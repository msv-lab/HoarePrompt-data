### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given a sorted prefix sum array `p` of a hidden array `a` consisting of only 1 and -1.
   - We need to count the number of possible arrays `a` that could result in the given `p` after sorting the prefix sums of `a`.
   - The result should be modulo 998244353.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - `dp` is a list of size `2 * n + 1` where `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum of `j - n` after `i` steps.
   - The `offset` is used to handle negative indices by shifting the prefix sums to a non-negative range.
   - The loop iterates over each element in `p` and updates the `dp` array based on the possible transitions from the current prefix sum to the next prefix sum (either adding 1 or -1).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Initialization**: `dp[offset] = 1` initializes the DP array with the base case where the prefix sum is 0.
   - **Transition**: For each step `i`, the new `dp` array is updated based on the previous `dp` array. The transitions are:
     - `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` for adding 1.
     - `new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD` for adding -1.
   - **Final Result**: The final result is `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum = p[-1] + offset`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads `n` and `p`, calls `func_1(n, p)`, and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

5. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly: `1 <= t <= 1000`, `1 <= n <= 5000`, and `|p_i| <= n`.
   - The program correctly initializes and updates the `dp` array.
   - The final result is correctly computed and returned.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 1` and `p = [0]`, the program correctly returns `0` because no array `a` can result in a prefix sum of 0.
   - For `n = 1` and `p = [1]`, the program correctly returns `1` because the only possible array `a` is `[1]`.
   - For `n = 3` and `p = [-1, 1, 2]`, the program correctly returns `0` because no array `a` can result in this prefix sum array.
   - For `n = 5` and `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`, the program correctly returns `3` because there are 3 possible arrays `a` that can result in this prefix sum array.
   - For `n = 5` and `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`, the program correctly returns `1` because the only possible array `a` is `[-1, -1, -1, -1, 1]`.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to count the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`. It handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
