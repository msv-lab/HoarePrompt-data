Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and calculates the number of integers that appear more than once. This count is printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, but the standard output will contain the results for each test case, and the variables `input`, `n`, `a`, `cnt`, and `ans` will retain the values from the last test case processed. **
