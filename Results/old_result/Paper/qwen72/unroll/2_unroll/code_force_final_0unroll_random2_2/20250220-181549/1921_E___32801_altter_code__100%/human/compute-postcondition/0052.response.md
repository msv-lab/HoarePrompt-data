The provided Python code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'bob'`. The initial state describes several variables (`n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`) and their relationships, but these variables are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is not influenced by the values of these variables.

Output: **bob**
