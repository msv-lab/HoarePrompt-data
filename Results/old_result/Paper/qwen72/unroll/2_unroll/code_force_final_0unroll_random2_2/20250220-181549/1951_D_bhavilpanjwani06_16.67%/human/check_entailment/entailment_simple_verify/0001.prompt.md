You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

Additionally, `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then the current value of `k - 1` is less than the current value of `n - k + 1`.

If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` and `k` are the same. Otherwise, `n` is greater than `k`, and if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`.

If `n` is less than `k`, the current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `n` and `k` are the same. If `n` is greater than `k`, then `n` is greater than `k`, and the relationship between `k - 1` and `n - k + 1` is preserved: if `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`; if `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`, then `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input and determine the output. This is a standard approach for handling multiple test cases.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

3. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if `n` is less than `k`. If `n < k`, it is impossible for Alice to buy `k` jewels because she doesn't have enough coins. In this case, the program correctly prints "NO".

4. **Exact Match Check**: If `n` is exactly equal to `k`, Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up a single stall with the price `n` per jewel. This ensures that Alice buys exactly one jewel from this stall, using all her coins. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by `1` (the number of stalls) and `n` (the price of the single stall).

5. **Greedy Buying Strategy**: If `n` is greater than `k`, the program needs to determine if it is possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The program uses the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` to decide the output. This condition can be rewritten as `2 * k - 1 < n`, which simplifies to `2 * k <= n`.

   - **Case 1**: If `2 * k <= n`, the program can set up two stalls: one with the price `n - k + 1` and another with the price `1`. Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and `1` jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. The program correctly prints "YES", followed by `2` (the number of stalls) and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.

   - **Case 2**: If `2 * k > n`, the program prints "NO" because it is not possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This is because if `2 * k > n`, Alice would not have enough coins to buy `k` jewels even if she buys one jewel at a time from the cheapest stalls.

6. **Output Format**: The program adheres to the required output format for both "YES" and "NO" cases. For "YES" cases, it prints the number of stalls and the prices of the stalls.

7. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - When `n == k`, it sets up a single stall with the price `n`.
   - When `n < k`, it correctly identifies that it is impossible.
   - When `2 * k <= n`, it sets up two stalls with appropriate prices.

8. **Constraints**: The program ensures that the number of stalls is at most 60, which is within the allowed limit.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct and handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
