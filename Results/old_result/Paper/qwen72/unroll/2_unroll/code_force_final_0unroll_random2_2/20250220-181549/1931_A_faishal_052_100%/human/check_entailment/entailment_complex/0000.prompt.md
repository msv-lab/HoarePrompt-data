Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept an integer n as input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex < 28:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            elif lex <= 78:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        info.append(arr)
        
    #State: The `info` list will contain `cases` sublists, each of which is a sorted list of three integers. Each sublist represents the positions of three lowercase Latin letters derived from the input `lex` value, with the positions adjusted according to the conditions in the loop. The `lex` value is used to determine the positions, and the loop ensures that the sum of the positions in each sublist equals the original `lex` value. The `cases` variable remains unchanged.
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        
        print(temp)
        
    #State: Output State: The `info` list remains unchanged, containing `cases` sublists, each of which is a sorted list of three integers. The `cases` variable also remains unchanged. The loop prints a string for each sublist in `info`, where each string consists of three lowercase Latin letters corresponding to the positions in the sublist. The sum of the positions in each sublist equals the original `lex` value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `cases` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) and calculates a sorted list of three integers that represent the positions of three lowercase Latin letters. The sum of these positions equals the original `lex` value. It then converts these positions into the corresponding lowercase letters and prints them. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `info` list contains `cases` sublists, each a sorted list of three integers, and the `cases` variable remains unchanged.
