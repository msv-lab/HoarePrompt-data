The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer input by the user. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer input by the user and `t` must be greater than 0, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 × 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and each of the k moves is represented by two integers r_i and c_i, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the moves are valid. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.**
