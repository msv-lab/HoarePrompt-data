You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        l1 = input().split()
        (n, k) = list(map(int, l1))
        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)

            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))
            print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop will read multiple test cases, each with two integers n and k. For each test case, if n == 1, it will print k. Otherwise, it will print a list of n integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than k, the second integer is the remainder of k after subtracting the first integer, and the remaining n-2 integers are 0. The loop will continue until all test cases have been processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `n` is 1, the program directly prints `k`. This is correct because the only way to satisfy the condition with a single integer is to use `k` itself.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the sequence of integers.
   - It then finds the largest power of 2 that is less than `k` and appends the value `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`. This value is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `i`-th bit, which maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation.
   - The program then appends the remaining value `k - sum(ans)` to `ans` to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.
   - Finally, it appends `0` to `ans` until the length of `ans` is `n`, ensuring the sequence has exactly `n` elements.

4. **Bitwise OR Operation**:
   - The bitwise OR operation `|` will combine the binary representations of the numbers in `ans`. The value `(1 << i) - 1` ensures that the maximum number of 1s is used in the binary representation.
   - The remaining value `k - sum(ans)` is added to ensure the sum condition is met. Since the remaining value is added to the sequence, it will not affect the maximization of 1s in the OR operation.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - For `n > 1`, the program ensures that the sequence has exactly `n` elements by appending zeros.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sequence `ans` for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the base case and the general case.
- It ensures the sum of the sequence equals `k` and maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.
- The program also ensures the sequence has exactly `n` elements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
