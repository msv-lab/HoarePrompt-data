Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

# Annotated Program:
from collections import Counter

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t test cases consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n, consisting only of "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func` has read `t` test cases from stdin, and for each test case, it has read an integer `n` and a string `arr`. The list `results` now contains `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated in the loop. Specifically, if `n` is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` remains the same as the initial input.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The function `func` has read `t` test cases from stdin, and for each test case, it has read an integer `n` and a string `arr`. The list `results` now contains `t` elements, where each element is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated in the loop. Specifically, if `n` is even, 'no' is appended to `results`. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in `arr` is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. The variable `t` remains the same as the initial input. The loop has printed each element of the `results` list, one per line. The `results` list is unchanged after the loop execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of coins and their initial states represented by a string of "U" and "D". For each test case, the function determines if it is possible to achieve a specific condition and appends 'yes' or 'no' to a list `results` based on the following rules: If the number of coins `n` is even, 'no' is appended. If `n` is odd and the count of 'U' in the string is greater than the count of 'D', 'yes' is appended. Otherwise, 'no' is appended. After processing all test cases, the function prints each element of `results`, one per line. The function does not return any value.
