To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `_` and `n`.

1. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop to iterate `n` times. It does not need to be adjusted as it is automatically managed by the `range(n)` function.
2. The variable `n` is the number of times the loop should run. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

Given the state before the loop starts, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. The other details about the function's input and constraints do not affect the loop's execution directly and are therefore not part of the loop head state.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
