Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Loop Range for `j`:**
   - The inner loop for `j` starts from 4 instead of 1. This means that the program will miss many valid pairs where `b` is less than 4.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `x`:**
   - The calculation of `x` is incorrect. The formula `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Incorrect Final Sum Calculation:**
   - The final sum `suma` is adjusted by subtracting 1, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.

4. **Commented Out Code:**
   - The commented-out code is not used, and it seems to be a different approach that was not fully implemented.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        
        suma = 0
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Iterate Over All Pairs:**
   - For each test case, the program iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.

3. **Check the Condition:**
   - For each pair, it checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the condition `(a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0`.

4. **Count Valid Pairs:**
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count `suma`.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, it prints the count of valid pairs.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
