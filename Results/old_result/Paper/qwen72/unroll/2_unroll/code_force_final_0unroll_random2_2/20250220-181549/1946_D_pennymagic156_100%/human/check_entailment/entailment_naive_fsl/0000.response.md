Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the input array `a` is empty. According to the problem description, the length of the array `a` is guaranteed to be at least 1 (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), but the program does not explicitly check this condition. If an empty array were to be passed (which should not happen according to the constraints but is a potential edge case to consider), the program would fail because it would attempt to iterate over an empty list, leading to incorrect behavior or an exception.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the input format for multiple test cases. The problem description specifies that the input consists of multiple test cases, and the first line contains the number of test cases `t`. However, the program does not read this value and does not loop over the test cases. This means that the program will only process the first test case and ignore the rest, leading to incorrect output for the given example and any other input with multiple test cases.

Here is a specific example where the program fails:
```
Input:
2
3 1
1 2 3
2 2
1 1

Expected Output:
2
2

Actual Output:
2
```

The program only outputs the result for the first test case and does not process the second test case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
