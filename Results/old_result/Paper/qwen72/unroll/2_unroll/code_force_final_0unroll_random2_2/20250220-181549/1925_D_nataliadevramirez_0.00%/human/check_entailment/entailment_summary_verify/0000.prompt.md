You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
    return result % MOD

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by calling another function `func_1` with the test case data, and prints the result of `func_1` for each test case. The function does not modify any external variables or state outside of its scope, and the value of `t` (the number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. The issue lies in the way the expected value is computed in `func_1`.

The program calculates the result as:
```python
result += f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD
```
This formula assumes that the friendship value of each pair is incremented by 1 for each excursion, which is incorrect. The problem description states that the friendship value of a pair is incremented by 1 only if the pair is chosen in an excursion. Therefore, the expected value of the friendship value increase for each pair should take into account the probability of the pair being chosen.

The correct approach involves calculating the expected number of times each pair is chosen over k excursions, which is given by:
\[ \text{Expected number of times chosen} = k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \]
where \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children from n children, which is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).

The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen is then:
\[ \text{Expected value} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \]

The provided program does not account for this probability and thus will produce incorrect results for many cases.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
1
3 1 2
1 2 1
```
Here, there are 3 children, 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1, and 2 excursions. The correct expected value should be:
\[ \text{Expected value} = 1 + 2 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \]
However, the program will output:
\[ 1 \times \left( \frac{2 \times 3}{2} \right) = 1 \times 3 = 3 \]
which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
