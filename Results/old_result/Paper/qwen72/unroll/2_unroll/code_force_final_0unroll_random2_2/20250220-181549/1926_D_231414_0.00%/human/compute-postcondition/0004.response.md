The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and a list of integers `a`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list of integers `a` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided.**
