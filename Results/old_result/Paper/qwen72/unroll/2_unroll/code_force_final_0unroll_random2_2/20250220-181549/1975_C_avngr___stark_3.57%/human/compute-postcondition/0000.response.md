Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. `t` is now an input integer.**
