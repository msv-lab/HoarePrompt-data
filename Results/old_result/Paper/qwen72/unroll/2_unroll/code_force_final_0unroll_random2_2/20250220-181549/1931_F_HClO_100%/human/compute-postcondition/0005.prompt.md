You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input through standard input or a predefined method, as the function definition does not include parameters. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the following k lines contains n integers representing the order of participants as seen by the participant who posted the screenshot. Each integer in the screenshot is unique and within the range [1, n]. The total number of test cases, t, is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n · k across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    t = int(input())

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the input for each case, and prints 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions specified in the loop. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `l1`, `a2`, `l2`, `l11`, `l22`, `idx1`, `idx2`, `p1`, `p2`, `val`, `a3`, and `l3` will be in their final states corresponding to the last test case processed. The variable `t` will be 0 if the loop has completed all iterations, and the other variables will hold the values from the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads multiple test cases from standard input or a predefined method. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines of `n` unique integers each. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.
