The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a temporary variable used in the loop and does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts. The `input` variable is read from standard input and should be a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0.

State: **`input` is a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0**
