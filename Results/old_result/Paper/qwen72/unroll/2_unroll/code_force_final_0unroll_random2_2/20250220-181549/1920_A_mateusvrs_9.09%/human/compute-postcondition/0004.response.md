Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `r` is a list of integers.
   - Each integer in `r` represents the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx` for each test case.
   - The length of `r` is equal to `t`, where `t` is the number of test cases.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*r, sep='\n')
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` function is used to print all elements of the list `r`.
   - The `*r` syntax unpacks the list `r`, so each element is passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
   - The `sep='\n'` argument specifies that each element should be separated by a newline character, meaning each element will be printed on a new line.

4. **Output**:
   - Since `r` is a list of integers, each integer in `r` will be printed on a new line.
   - The exact values of the integers in `r` depend on the specific test cases and the values of `bx`, `ax`, and `cx` for each test case.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be each integer in the list `r` printed on a new line. The values of these integers are determined by the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx` for each test case.

Output: **Each integer in the list `r` printed on a new line (where each integer represents the number of valid integers between `bx` and `ax` (inclusive) that are not in the set `cx` for each test case)**
