### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and converts them to integers.

2. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The program initializes the answer `ans` to `n`. This is because for `b = 1`, every `a` from 1 to `n` will satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1).

3. **Loop for Different Values of `b`:**
   - The program iterates over `b` from 2 to the minimum of `n` and `m` (inclusive).
   - For each `b`, it calculates the number of valid `a` values using the formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\).

4. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is used to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b`.
   - However, this formula is incorrect. The correct condition to check is whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Correct Condition:**
   - For a given `b`, the number of valid `a` values should be determined by checking if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct way to count valid `a` values for a given `b` is to iterate over all possible `a` values from 1 to `n` and check the condition.

6. **Efficiency:**
   - The current program's approach is not efficient and does not correctly implement the required condition.
   - A more efficient approach would involve using properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and modular arithmetic to count valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it uses an incorrect formula to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Correctness: False**
