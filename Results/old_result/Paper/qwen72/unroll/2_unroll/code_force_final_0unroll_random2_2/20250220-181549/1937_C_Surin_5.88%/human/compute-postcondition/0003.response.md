Output State: **For each test case, the loop outputs two indices `prev` and `v1` such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized. The loop iterates through all test cases, and for each test case, it queries the input to find these indices and then prints them in the format `! {prev} {v1}`. After all iterations, the variables `kp`, `n`, `g`, `v1`, and `prev` will have their final values corresponding to the last test case processed. The total number of queries made for all test cases will not exceed the allowed limit of 3n.**
