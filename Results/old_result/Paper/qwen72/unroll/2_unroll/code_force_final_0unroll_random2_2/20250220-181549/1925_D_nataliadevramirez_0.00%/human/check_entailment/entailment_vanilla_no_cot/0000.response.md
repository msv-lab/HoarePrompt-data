Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the chosen pairs of children. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The program simply multiplies the initial friendship value \( f_i \) by the sum of the first \( k \) natural numbers \( \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) and then takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - This approach does not account for the probability of choosing each pair and the fact that the friendship value increases only if the same pair is chosen again.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each pair of friends, the expected increase in their friendship value over \( k \) excursions is the sum of the probabilities of choosing that pair in each excursion.
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair of friends in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) is the total number of possible pairs.
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair over \( k \) excursions is \( k \times \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The total expected value for all pairs is the sum of the expected values for each pair.

3. **Modular Inverse:**
   - The problem requires calculating \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers.
   - The program does not handle the modular inverse calculation, which is necessary to compute the final result correctly.

### Corrected Program:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

# Function to compute modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem
def mod_inverse(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    inv_total_pairs = mod_inverse(total_pairs, MOD)
    result = 0
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        expected_increase = (f * k * inv_total_pairs) % MOD
        result = (result + expected_increase) % MOD
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

# Example usage
# func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **mod_inverse(x, mod):** Computes the modular inverse of \( x \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) using Fermat's Little Theorem.
- **func_1(n, m, k, friendships):** Calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs.
  - **total_pairs:** Total number of possible pairs of children.
  - **inv_total_pairs:** Modular inverse of the total number of pairs.
  - **expected_increase:** Expected increase in the friendship value for each pair over \( k \) excursions.
  - **result:** Sum of the expected increases for all pairs, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

This corrected program should now correctly solve the problem as described.
