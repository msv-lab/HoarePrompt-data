Functionality: ** The function `func_5` accepts no parameters directly but internally uses the values of `n` and `x` returned by `func_3`, and a list `a` of `n` integers returned by `func_1`. It processes the list `a` based on the bitwise conditions of `x` and the elements in `a`. The function returns the maximum value between the length of the transformed list `a` and the count of elements in `a` that have a 0 in the \( i \)-th bit, where \( u == 1 \) and \( v \% 2 == 0 \). The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged throughout the function execution. **
