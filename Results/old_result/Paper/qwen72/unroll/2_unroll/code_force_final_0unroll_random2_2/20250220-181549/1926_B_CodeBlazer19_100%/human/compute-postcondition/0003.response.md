The function `func` accepts a parameter `grid`. `grid` is a list of strings, where each string represents a row of the grid and consists of characters '0' or '1'. The grid is of size n x n, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape cannot consist of exactly one '1'. The function returns the type of the shape found in the grid, which can be either "triangle" or "square".

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `grid`, a list of strings representing a grid of size n x n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) with characters '0' or '1'. It returns "triangle" if a triangle is found in the grid, and "square" if a square is found in the grid.**
