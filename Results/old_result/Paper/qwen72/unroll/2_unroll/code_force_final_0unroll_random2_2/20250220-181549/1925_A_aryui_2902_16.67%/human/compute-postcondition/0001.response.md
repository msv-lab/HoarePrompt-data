Initial State: The function `func_1` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. These integers represent the length of the strings to be formed and the number of first lowercase English alphabets to be used, respectively. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values provided by the user input.

Code Snippet:
```
s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The variable `s` is assigned the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'`. This string contains the first 22 lowercase English alphabets. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment to `s`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers provided by the user input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26; `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'**.
