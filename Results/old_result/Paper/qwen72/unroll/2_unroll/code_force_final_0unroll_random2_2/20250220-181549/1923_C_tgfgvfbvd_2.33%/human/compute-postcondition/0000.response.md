To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. The loop head in this case is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

Here, the only object in the loop head is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. The loop will execute if and only if `int(input())` is greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases.
- Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `q` queries where each query is defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n).
- The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` and `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once. Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` is at least 1.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
