The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `info` being an empty list and the input constraints on `n` do not affect the loop's execution directly, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list, the function accepts an integer `n` where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78**
