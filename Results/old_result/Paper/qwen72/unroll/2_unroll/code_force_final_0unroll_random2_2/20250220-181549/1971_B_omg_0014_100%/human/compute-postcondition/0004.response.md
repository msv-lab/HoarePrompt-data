Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each with a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It reads the number of test cases `n` from the input, and for each test case, it reads a string `s`. If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest version of the string if `s` is not already sorted in ascending order, or the lexicographically largest version of the string if `s` is already sorted in ascending order. The function does not return any values, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are local to each iteration of the loop and do not persist outside of it. **
