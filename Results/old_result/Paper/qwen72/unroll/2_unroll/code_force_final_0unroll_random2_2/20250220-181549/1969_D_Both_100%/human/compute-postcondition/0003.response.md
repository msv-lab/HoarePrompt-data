The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It internally uses variables such as `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`. These variables are initialized and manipulated within the function, with `test_cases` being a positive integer, `n` and `k` being non-negative integers where 0 <= k <= n, `prices` and `bonuses` being lists of positive integers, and `combined` being a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative integer and a positive integer.

The function returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting `k` items from a list of `n` items, where each item has a price and a bonus. The profit is calculated based on the prices and bonuses of the selected items.
