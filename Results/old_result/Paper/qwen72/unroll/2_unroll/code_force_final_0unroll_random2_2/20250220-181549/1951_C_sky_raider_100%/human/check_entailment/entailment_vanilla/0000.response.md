### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the program always buys tickets at the lowest possible price first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes three variables: `t` (the total number of tickets bought so far), `s` (the number of tickets to buy on the current day), and `c` (the total cost).

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop**:
   - The program iterates over each day, from the cheapest to the most expensive.
   - For each day, it calculates the number of tickets to buy `s` as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets that can be bought on a single day) and `k` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - It updates the total cost `c` by adding the cost of buying `s` tickets on the current day, adjusted by the total number of tickets bought so far `t`.
   - It then updates `t` by adding `s` and decreases `k` by `s`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all the days, the program prints the total cost `c` for the current test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The program correctly sorts the ticket prices to ensure that tickets are bought at the lowest possible prices first.
  - The program correctly handles the constraint that a person can buy no more than `m` tickets per day.
  - The program correctly updates the total cost by considering the increase in ticket prices due to the tickets bought on previous days.
  - The program ensures that exactly `k` tickets are bought by decrementing `k` and stopping the loop when `k` reaches 0.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by buying all the remaining tickets on the first day.
  - The program handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by distributing the ticket purchases over multiple days.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The sorting step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
  - The loop runs in \(O(n)\) time, which is also efficient.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately and efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
