Precondition: **The function is part of an interactive problem where the input is a sequence of test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.**
