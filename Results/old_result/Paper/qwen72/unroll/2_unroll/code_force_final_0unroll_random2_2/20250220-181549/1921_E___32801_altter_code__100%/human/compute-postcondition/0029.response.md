Output State: **`n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4]`, `x2` is greater than `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, if `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1`, `y2` is less than or equal to `y1`, and `a` is `y2 - 1`. Otherwise, `y1` is `r[3] + 1`, `y2` is greater than `y1`, and `a` is equal to `r[1] - y2`. `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.** 

Explanation:
- `x1` is incremented by `a`.
- The value of `a` is determined based on the conditions given for `y1` and `y2`.
- All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
