### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1` to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - Based on the result, it appends "Yes" or "No" to the output list `OUT`.
   - If the result is "No", it constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s` and appends it to `OUT`.
   - Finally, it prints all elements in `OUT`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `s1` is initialized as an empty string.
     - `s2` is initialized as an empty string.
     - `alphabet` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - **Loop through `s`**:
     - For each character `i` in `s`:
       - If `i` is in `alphabet`, it is added to `s1`.
       - If `alphabet` contains more than one character, `i` is removed from `alphabet`.
       - If `alphabet` contains only one character, `i` is added to `s2` and `alphabet` is reset to the full set of the first `k` alphabets.
   - **Final Checks**:
     - `r` is calculated as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
     - The function returns a tuple containing:
       - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
       - A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
       - The string `s2`.

4. **Correctness of `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
     - The set `alphabet` is used to track the presence of characters in `s`, but it is reset to the full set when `alphabet` contains only one character.
     - This reset operation does not correctly track the subsequences of length `n` formed by the first `k` alphabets.
     - The condition `len(s1) >= n * k` is not sufficient to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

5. **Output Construction**:
   - If the function returns `False`, the program attempts to construct a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.
   - It does this by finding the first character that is not in `s1` and repeating it to form a string of length `n`.
   - This approach is not guaranteed to produce a valid string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. The logic for constructing the output string when the answer is "No" is also flawed.

### Correctness:
**False**
