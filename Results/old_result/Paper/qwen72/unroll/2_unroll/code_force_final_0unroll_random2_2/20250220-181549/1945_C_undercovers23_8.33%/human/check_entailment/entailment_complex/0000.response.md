### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function correctly calculates `pk` as the middle index of the village, which is used to determine the closest position to the middle.
   - It converts the string `s` into a list `sl` and counts the total number of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`).

3. **Iterating Through Possible Positions:**
   - The function iterates through all possible positions for the road (from 0 to `n-1`), and for each position, it updates the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It calculates the percentage of residents on the left side who want to live on the left side (`zero_perc`) and the percentage of residents on the right side who want to live on the right side (`one_perc`).

4. **Condition Check:**
   - The function checks if both `zero_perc` and `one_perc` are at least 50%. If they are, it adds the current position to the list `lst`.

5. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The function then finds the position in `lst` that is closest to the middle of the village (`pk`).
   - If no such position exists, it checks the overall majority of residents who want to live on the left or right side and prints either 0 or `n` accordingly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (0) or after the last house (`n`).

### Issues:
- **Percentage Calculation:**
  - The percentage calculation is incorrect. The function should not multiply by 100 and then use `math.ceil`. Instead, it should directly check if the count of '0's on the left side is at least half of the left side and the count of '1's on the right side is at least half of the right side.
  - The correct condition should be:
    ```python
    if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 and (o - one) >= (n - i - 1) // 2:
    ```

- **Final Output:**
  - The final output logic is correct, but the percentage calculation logic is flawed, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            pk = n // 2
        else:
            pk = n // 2
        
        sl = list(s)
        o = sl.count('1')
        z = sl.count('0')
        
        zero, one = 0, 0
        lst = []
        mini = pow(10, 8)
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            if s[i] == '0':
                zero += 1
            else:
                one += 1
            if zero >= (i + 1) // 2 and (o - one) >= (n - i - 1) // 2:
                lst.append(i + 1)
        
        for ele in lst:
            mini = min(mini, abs(pk - ele))
        
        final = []
        for elem in lst:
            if abs(pk - elem) == mini:
                final.append(elem)
        
        final.sort()
        
        if len(final) == 0:
            if z >= n // 2:
                final.append(0)
            else:
                final.append(n)
        
        print(final[0])
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the corrected code is used.
- **False** if the original code is used due to the incorrect percentage calculation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the incorrect percentage calculation in the original code).
