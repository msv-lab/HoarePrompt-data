Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` in its original order, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.** 

Explanation: The `reversed(ans)` function call returns an iterator that yields the elements of `ans` in reverse order. However, since the `ans` list was already constructed to contain the cumulative products in reverse order, reversing it again will give us the original order of cumulative products.
