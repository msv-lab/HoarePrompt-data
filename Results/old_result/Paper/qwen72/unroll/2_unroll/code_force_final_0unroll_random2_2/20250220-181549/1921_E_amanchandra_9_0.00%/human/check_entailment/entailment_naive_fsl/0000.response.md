Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the outcome of the game is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4 4 1 1 4 4
```

Expected Output:
```
Draw
```

However, the program outputs:
```
Alice
```

This is incorrect. In this test case, Alice starts at (1, 1) and Bob starts at (4, 4). Alice can only move down, down-left, or down-right, and Bob can only move up, up-left, or up-right. Since Alice starts at the top-left corner and Bob starts at the bottom-right corner, they cannot meet on the board, and the game will end in a draw. The program incorrectly predicts that Alice wins, which violates the problem description.
