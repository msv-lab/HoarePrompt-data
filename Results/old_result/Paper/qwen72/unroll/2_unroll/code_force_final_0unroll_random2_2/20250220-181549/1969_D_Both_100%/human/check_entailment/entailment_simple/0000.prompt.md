Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1

    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_1():
    return int(read_input())
    #The program returns an integer value that is input by the user.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters. The function reads input from a source (presumably standard input) and splits it into integers.
def func_2():

    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers obtained from splitting the input string.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: primary_items is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i) representing the price of an item for Alice and Bob respectively, and secondary_heap is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i) representing the price of an item for Alice and Bob respectively.

    return total
    #The program returns 59.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed in the function signature, but the function internally uses variables such as `test_cases`, `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined`. These variables are expected to be initialized and manipulated within the function, with `test_cases` being a positive integer, `n` and `k` being non-negative integers where 0 <= k <= n, `prices` and `bonuses` being lists of positive integers, and `combined` being a list of tuples where each tuple contains a negative integer and a positive integer.

    #State: The loop iterates `test_cases` times, and after each iteration, the variables `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` are reset to their initial values within the loop. Therefore, after all iterations, these variables will not retain any specific final state from the last iteration, but the `max_profit` for each test case will be printed. The variables `test_cases` and any other variables not mentioned in the loop head and body remain unchanged.
