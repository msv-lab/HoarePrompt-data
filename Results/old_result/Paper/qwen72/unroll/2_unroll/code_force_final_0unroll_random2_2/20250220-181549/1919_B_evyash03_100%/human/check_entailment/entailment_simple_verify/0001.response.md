Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to split a string `s` of length `n` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized. The penalty of a subarray is defined as the absolute value of the sum of its elements multiplied by its length. The elements of the array `a` are derived from the string `s` where `+` corresponds to `1` and `-` corresponds to `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `length` and the string `expression`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with the string `expression` and its length `length`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a counter `count` to zero.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `expression`.
   - If the character is `+`, it increments the counter `count`.
   - It calculates the number of `-` characters as `sub = length - count`.
   - Finally, it returns the absolute difference between `sub` and `count`.

4. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is attempting to calculate the minimum penalty by considering the entire array as a single subarray.
   - The penalty for the entire array `a` is given by \( p(a) = | \sum a_i | \cdot n \).
   - The sum of the array `a` is calculated as `count - sub`, where `count` is the number of `+` characters and `sub` is the number of `-` characters.
   - The penalty for the entire array is then \( p(a) = | \text{count} - \text{sub} | \cdot n \).

5. **Optimality Check**:
   - The program does not consider splitting the array into multiple subarrays.
   - The optimal way to minimize the penalty is to split the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is zero. If this is not possible, the next best approach is to split the array into the smallest possible subarrays to minimize the penalty.
   - The program's logic of calculating the absolute difference and multiplying by the length of the array does not necessarily yield the minimum penalty for all cases.

6. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case `expression = "+-+-+"` and `length = 5`.
   - The program will calculate `count = 3` (for `+`) and `sub = 2` (for `-`).
   - The penalty is \( |3 - 2| \cdot 5 = 1 \cdot 5 = 5 \).
   - However, the optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])`, which results in a penalty of \( p([1, -1]) + p([1, -1]) + p([1]) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).

Given the above reasoning and the counterexample, the program does not always produce the correct minimum penalty.

Final: **False**
