Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) from the input. It then calculates and prints the number of alternating character sequences in the string `s`, subtracting one if a '01' pattern is found. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The variable `s` is updated for each test case, and `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
