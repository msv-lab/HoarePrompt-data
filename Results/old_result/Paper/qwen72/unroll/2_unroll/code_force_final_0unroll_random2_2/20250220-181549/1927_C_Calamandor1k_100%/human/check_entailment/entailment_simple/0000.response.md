### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates `t` times to read the input for each test case. Each test case is stored as a tuple `(n, m, k, a, b)` in the list `cases`.

2. **Set Operations:**
   - The program creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from the arrays `a` and `b`, respectively. This ensures that each element is unique and allows for efficient set operations.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.

3. **Set Differences and Intersections:**
   - The program calculates the elements that are only in `relevant_a` (`only_a`), only in `relevant_b` (`only_b`), and present in both (`both`).

4. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case. This is because if there are more than `k // 2` elements in `only_a`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` that are unique to `a` and still have enough elements left to form the required set.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - The program then calculates the total number of distinct elements in `relevant_a` and `relevant_b` combined (`total_distinct`). If this total is less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results list, as there are not enough unique elements to form the required set.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that it is possible to choose the elements in the required way.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case, as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to choose `k // 2` elements from each array such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included. The set operations and conditions are logically sound and cover all necessary cases.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
