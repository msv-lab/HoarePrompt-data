### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Let's break down the issues and the reasoning behind the original assessment:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` constructs `s1` by removing characters from the `alphabet` set as they appear in `s`. If the `alphabet` set has only one character left, it resets the `alphabet` set and appends the character to `s2`.
   - The function then returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2`.

2. **Issues with `func_1`:**
   - The logic of `func_1` is flawed because it does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The function `func_1` only checks if the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, which is not sufficient to determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - The construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence is also incorrect. It simply appends the remaining characters from the `alphabet` set to `s2`, which does not guarantee that the resulting string is one that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

3. **Example Case:**
   - **Input:**
     ```
     1
     2 2 3
     aab
     ```
   - **Expected Output:**
     ```
     NO
     ba
     ```
   - **Actual Output:**
     ```
     No
     aa
     ```
   - **Explanation:**
     - The function `func_1` processes the string `aab` and constructs `s1` as `aab` and `s2` as `a` (since `a` is the last character after resetting the `alphabet` set).
     - The boolean `b` is `True` because `len(s1) >= 2 * 2` (4 >= 4).
     - However, the program incorrectly identifies "aa" as a string that does not occur as a subsequence in "aab". The correct string that does not occur as a subsequence in "aab" is "ba".

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, you need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, return "NO" and the string that is not a subsequence.
   - If all strings are subsequences, return "YES".

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle all potential cases and fails to identify the correct string that does not occur as a subsequence in `s`.

Final: **False**
