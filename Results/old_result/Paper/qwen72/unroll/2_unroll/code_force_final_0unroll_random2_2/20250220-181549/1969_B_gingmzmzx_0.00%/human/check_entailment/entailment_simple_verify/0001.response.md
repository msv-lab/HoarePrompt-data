### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to handle each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The variable `zeroes` is used to count the number of 0s in the string `s`, which is correctly computed using `s.count(0)`.

3. **Counting and Cost Calculation:**
   - The variable `cnt` is a list with two elements, where `cnt[0]` counts the number of 0s encountered so far and `cnt[1]` counts the number of 1s encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and will store the total cost of sorting the string.

4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, it increments `cnt[0]` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s encountered so far (`cnt[1] > 0`). This is because a 0 encountered after a 1 needs to be moved to the front of the substring to sort it.
     - If `c` is 1, it increments `cnt[1]` and adds the difference between the total number of 0s and the number of 0s encountered so far (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans`. This is because each 1 encountered after a 0 needs to move all the remaining 0s to the front of the substring to sort it.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing the string, the function prints the total cost `ans` for the current test case.

### Validation Using Annotations:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - The function should handle multiple test cases, and for each test case, it should read a binary string `s` and compute the minimum total cost to sort it.

- **State after reading the number of test cases:**
  - The variable `n` is correctly set to the number of test cases.

- **State after reading a binary string and converting it to a list of integers:**
  - The string `s` is correctly converted to a list of integers, and the number of 0s is counted and stored in `zeroes`.

- **State during the iteration through the string:**
  - The loop correctly updates `cnt` and `ans` based on the current character `c`.
  - When `c` is 0 and there are 1s before it, the cost is correctly incremented by 1.
  - When `c` is 1, the cost is correctly incremented by the number of 0s that need to be moved past the current 1.

- **State after the loop:**
  - The total cost `ans` is printed for the current test case.
  - The variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` are reset for the next iteration.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts on substrings. The algorithm efficiently counts the number of 0s and 1s and calculates the cost of moving 0s past 1s to achieve a sorted order. The code handles the constraints specified in the problem and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Final: **True**
