The only objects in the loop head are the variables `tc` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, and `t` is an input integer. For the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and `tc` is 0.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
