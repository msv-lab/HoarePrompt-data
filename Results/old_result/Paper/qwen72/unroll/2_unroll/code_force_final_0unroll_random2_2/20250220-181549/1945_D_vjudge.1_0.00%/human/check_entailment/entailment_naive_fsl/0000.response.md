Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill) is equal to `n` (the number of people in the queue). In such a case, Kirill is already in the desired position, and he should not need to spend any coins. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not account for this and will still attempt to calculate the cost, leading to an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 7
7 2 9 2 6 5 9
9 1 10 7 1 4 9
```
The expected output is `0` because Kirill is already in the last position, and he does not need to bribe anyone. However, the program will output `9`, which is incorrect.
