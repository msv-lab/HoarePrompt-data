### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating through each test case. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the list `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Splitting the Array**: The program splits the array `a` into two halves, `b` and `c`, where `b` contains the first `n` elements and `c` contains the last `n` elements. This is in line with the problem statement.

3. **Sorting**: Both `b` and `c` are sorted. Sorting is necessary to facilitate the selection of pairs of elements that are equal, which is a key part of the solution.

4. **Initial Selection for `l`**:
   - The program checks if the first two elements of `b` are different. If they are, it appends the first element to `l`.
   - It also checks if the last two elements of `b` are different. If they are not, it appends the last element to `ans1` twice and decreases `k` by 2. This is a bit confusing and may not be necessary, as it could lead to incorrect results if the last two elements are the same but not part of the required pairs.

5. **Filling `ans1`**:
   - The program iterates through the middle elements of `b` and appends pairs of equal elements to `ans1` until `k` reaches 0. This is correct because it ensures that `ans1` is filled with pairs of elements that are equal, which is a valid subset of the first half of `a`.

6. **Filling `ans2`**:
   - Similarly, the program iterates through the elements of `c` and appends pairs of equal elements to `ans2` until `k` reaches 0. This is also correct for the same reason as above.

7. **Balancing `ans1` and `ans2`**:
   - If there are any elements left in `l` (which contains elements that were not paired in `b`), the program appends these elements to both `ans1` and `ans2` to ensure that the lengths of `ans1` and `ans2` are both `2k` and that their bitwise XORs are equal. This is a valid approach because the XOR of an element with itself is 0, and adding the same elements to both arrays will not affect the equality of their XORs.

8. **Output**: The program prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem statement.

### Issues:
- **Initial Selection for `l`**: The initial selection of elements for `l` and the handling of the last two elements of `b` is not necessary and can be simplified. The program should focus on selecting pairs of equal elements directly from `b` and `c`.

- **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where `k` is 1 or `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2`). However, the problem guarantees that at least one pair of `l` and `r` always exists, so this might not be a critical issue.

### Conclusion:
Despite some unnecessary steps and potential edge case handling, the program's logic is fundamentally correct and should work for the given problem constraints. The program correctly identifies pairs of equal elements and ensures that the lengths of `ans1` and `ans2` are both `2k` and that their bitwise XORs are equal.

### Correctness:
**True**
