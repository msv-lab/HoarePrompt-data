You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Output

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        s = input()
        m = s.count('map')
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        p = s.count('pie')
        print(m + p)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called with parameters in a context where the first parameter is a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, the first line contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6) representing the length of the string `s`, and the next line contains the string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        m = s.count('map')
        
        s = s.replace('map', '')
        
        p = s.count('pie')
        
        print(m + p)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has printed the sum of the counts of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' for each of the `t` test cases. The variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` are no longer in scope after the loop finishes executing.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`, removes all occurrences of 'map' from `s`, and then prints the sum of the counts of 'map' and 'pie' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the variables `n`, `s`, `m`, and `p` are no longer in scope. The variable `t` remains unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program only counts and removes the exact substrings "map" and "pie" without considering the possibility of overlapping occurrences or the need to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "pie" and "map".

For example, consider the input:
```
1
11
pppiepieeee
```
The correct output should be 2, as removing the 4th and 7th characters ('p' and 'i') would make the string "pppiepieeee" beautiful by removing the "pie" and "map" substrings. However, the program will output 1 because it only counts and removes the exact substring "pie" once, without considering the overlapping "map" that can be formed after removing "pie".

Another example:
```
1
8
mappppie
```
The correct output should be 2, as removing the 1st and 4th characters ('m' and 'p') would make the string "apppie" beautiful. However, the program will output 2, but it does so by removing "map" and "pie" separately, which is not the minimum number of deletions required.

These cases demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle the problem requirements.
