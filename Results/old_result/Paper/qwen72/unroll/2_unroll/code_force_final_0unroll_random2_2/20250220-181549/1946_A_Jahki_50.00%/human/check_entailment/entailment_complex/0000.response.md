### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(t):` where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases, each defined by the input `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array itself `case`.
   - If `num2` is greater than 10000, it prints `1` and `16668` and breaks out of the loop. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify any special handling for large `num2` values, and the output `16668` is not explained or justified.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The function correctly sorts the array `a` and calculates the index of the median.
   - However, the logic to increase the median is flawed. The function repeatedly increments the element at the median index and sorts the array, which is inefficient and incorrect. The correct approach should be to find the smallest number greater than the current median and calculate the number of operations needed to make the median equal to this number.

4. **Efficiency and Logic**:
   - The current implementation is inefficient because it sorts the array multiple times within the loop.
   - The correct approach should involve a single sort and then a linear scan to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The function `func` has several issues:
- It does not handle multiple test cases correctly.
- It has an incorrect and inefficient method for increasing the median.
- The special case for `num2 > 10000` is not justified and does not align with the problem description.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def min_operations_to_increase_median(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a_sorted = sorted(a)
        if n % 2 == 0:
            median_index = n // 2 - 1
        else:
            median_index = n // 2
        
        median = a_sorted[median_index]
        
        # Find the smallest number greater than the median
        new_median = median + 1
        while new_median not in a_sorted:
            new_median += 1
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if a_sorted[i] < new_median:
                operations += new_median - a_sorted[i]
            else:
                break
        
        print(operations)

# Example usage:
# t = int(input())
# min_operations_to_increase_median(t)
```

This corrected function:
- Handles multiple test cases.
- Correctly calculates the median.
- Efficiently finds the smallest number greater than the current median.
- Calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
