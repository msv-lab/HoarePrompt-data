### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `casos` and then iterates over each test case, reading the integer `n` for each one.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - For `n == 1`, the function prints a 2x2 checkerboard with all cells being `#`.
   - For `n == 2`, the function prints a 4x4 checkerboard with the correct alternating pattern of `#` and `.`.
   - For `n == 3`, the function prints a 6x6 checkerboard with the correct alternating pattern of `#` and `.`.
   - For `n == 4`, the function prints an 8x8 checkerboard with the correct alternating pattern of `#` and `.`.
   - For any other value of `n` (i.e., `n > 4` or `n < 1`), the function prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "It is not in the range" in Spanish).

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the checkerboard patterns without spaces and without any empty lines between test cases, which is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Range Check**:
   - The function correctly handles the range of `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) by printing the checkerboard for valid values and a message for invalid values. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen for `n > 4`, so the function's behavior for `n > 4` is not aligned with the expected output.

5. **Generalization**:
   - The function does not generalize the checkerboard generation for any `n` within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. It only handles specific cases (1, 2, 3, 4) and fails to generate the correct pattern for other values of `n`.

### Correctness:
Given that the function only handles specific cases and does not generalize for all valid `n` values (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), it is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
