The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list of integers and an integer `m`. The list represents the number of problems of each difficulty level (A to G) and should have exactly 7 elements, each of which is non-negative. The integer `m` represents the number of rounds and should be a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 5. The function always returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of 7 non-negative integers representing the number of problems of each difficulty level (A to G) and an integer `m` (1 <= m <= 5) representing the number of rounds. It always returns 0.**
