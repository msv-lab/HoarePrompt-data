Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine the winner of the game between Anna and Sasha.
2. **Game Rules**:
   - Anna reverses the digits of one element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when Sasha can't make a move (i.e., there is exactly one number left in the list).
   - Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\).
   - Anna wins otherwise.
3. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

### Program Analysis
#### Function 1: `func_1(n, m, nums)`
1. **Total Digits Calculation**:
   - `tot = sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`: This line calculates the total number of digits in all the numbers in the list.
2. **Count of Trailing Zeros**:
   - `cntvals = sorted((zerocnts(val) for val in nums), reverse=True)`: This line calculates the number of trailing zeros for each number and sorts these counts in descending order.
3. **Subtracting Trailing Zeros**:
   - `for i in range(0, len(cntvals), 2): tot -= cntvals[i]`: This loop subtracts the number of trailing zeros for every second element in the sorted list of trailing zeros. This is done to simulate the effect of Anna's optimal moves, where she would reverse the digits of the numbers with the most trailing zeros first.
4. **Determine Winner**:
   - `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'`: This line checks if the total number of digits after Anna's optimal moves is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

#### Function 2: `zerocnts(num)`
1. **Convert to String**:
   - `num = str(num)`: Convert the number to a string to easily count trailing zeros.
2. **Count Trailing Zeros**:
   - `tot = 0`: Initialize a counter for trailing zeros.
   - `for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1): if num[i] != '0': break; tot += 1`: This loop counts the number of trailing zeros by iterating from the end of the string until a non-zero digit is encountered.

### Correctness Verification
1. **Total Digits Calculation**:
   - The total number of digits in the list is correctly calculated using `sum((len(val) for val in map(str, nums)))`.
2. **Trailing Zeros Calculation**:
   - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in each number.
3. **Optimal Moves**:
   - Anna's optimal strategy is to reverse the digits of the numbers with the most trailing zeros first. This is correctly simulated by sorting the trailing zeros in descending order and subtracting every second value.
4. **Winning Condition**:
   - The final condition `return 'Sasha' if tot >= m + 1 else 'Anna'` correctly checks if the total number of digits after Anna's optimal moves is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\), which determines the winner.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the problem description. It accurately calculates the total number of digits, simulates Anna's optimal moves, and checks the winning condition.

Correctness: **True**
