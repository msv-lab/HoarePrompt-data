Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**: The program assumes that the input is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence of length not exceeding 500,000, as specified in the problem description. This is a valid assumption based on the problem constraints.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix for each character in the input string `s`. It increments the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrements it for a closing parenthesis `)`.

3. **Details List Construction**: The program constructs a list `details` where each element is a tuple containing the balance of the prefix, the negative index of the character, and the character itself. Using the negative index ensures that when sorting by balance, ties are broken in decreasing order of position, as required.

4. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `details` list based on the prefix balance in increasing order and the negative index in decreasing order. This step is crucial for the balanced shuffle operation.

5. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list. This step correctly forms the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

Given the above steps, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
