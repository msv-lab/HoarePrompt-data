Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `index` is 0.**

Explanation: The value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which is `data[0]`. The other variables (`n`, `p`, `data`, and `index`) remain unchanged.
