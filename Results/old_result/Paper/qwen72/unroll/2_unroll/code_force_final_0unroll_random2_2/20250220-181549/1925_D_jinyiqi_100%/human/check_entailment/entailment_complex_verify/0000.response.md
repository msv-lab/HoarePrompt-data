Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the formula used in the program to calculate the expected value is incorrect. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Initial Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The initial sum of friendship values is correctly calculated as `sum_f` by summing up the friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Total Number of Possible Pairs**:
   - The total number of possible pairs of children is correctly calculated as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

3. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{p} = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{p} = k \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = \text{cn2}
     \]

4. **Explanation of the Correct Formula**:
   - **Initial Contribution**: The initial sum of friendship values `sum_f` contributes `k * sum_f` to the expected value because each of the `k` excursions will have the initial friendship values.
   - **Expected Increase**: For each pair of friends, the expected increase in the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is `k * (k - 1) / 2` because each pair has a `1 / cn2` chance of being chosen in each excursion, and if chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion. Since there are `m` pairs of friends, the total expected increase is `m * (k * (k - 1) / 2)`.

5. **Example Test Case**:
   - For the test case:
     \[
     n = 3, m = 1, k = 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{friends} = (1, 2, 1)
     \]
   - The correct expected value should be:
     \[
     \text{sum_f} = 1
     \]
     \[
     \text{cn2} = 3
     \]
     \[
     \text{p} = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 1}{2} = 2 + 1 = 3
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = 3
     \]
   - The expected value is \(\frac{3}{3} = 1\), but the program would calculate it incorrectly as:
     \[
     \text{p} = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 12 + 2 = 14
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18
     \]
     \[
     \text{gcd} = \text{math.gcd}(14, 18) = 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{p} = 14 // 2 = 7
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = 18 // 2 = 9
     \]
     \[
     \text{result} = 7 \cdot \text{pow}(9, -1, M) \bmod M
     \]
     - The modular inverse of 9 modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is 111111112, so:
     \[
     \text{result} = 7 \cdot 111111112 \bmod (10^9 + 7) = 777777784
     \]
   - This result is clearly incorrect, as the expected value should be 1.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is accurate in identifying the incorrect formula used in the program. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
