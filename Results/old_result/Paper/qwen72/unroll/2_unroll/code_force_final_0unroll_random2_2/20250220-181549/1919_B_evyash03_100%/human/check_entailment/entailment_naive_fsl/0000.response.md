Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and returns the absolute difference between these counts. However, this does not follow the process described in the problem statement, which involves splitting the array into subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray.

### Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
1
6
+-+---
```
The array `a` derived from the string `s` would be `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1]`.

The optimal way to split this array to minimize the penalty is:
- `[1, -1]` (sum = 0, penalty = 0 * 2 = 0)
- `[1, -1]` (sum = 0, penalty = 0 * 2 = 0)
- `[-1, -1]` (sum = -2, penalty = 2 * 2 = 4)

The total penalty is 0 + 0 + 4 = 4.

However, the provided program would output:
```
3
```
This is because it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `3` (3 '-' characters and 3 '+' characters).

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
