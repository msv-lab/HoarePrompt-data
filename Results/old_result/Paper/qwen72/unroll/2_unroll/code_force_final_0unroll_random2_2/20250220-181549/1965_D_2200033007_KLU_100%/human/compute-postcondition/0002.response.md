Output State: **`odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of `a`, `n` is a positive integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, the length of `odds` is (n + 1) // 2, `a` is a list of `n` zeros, `prev` is 0, `idx` is (n - 1) // 2.**

The value of `idx` is calculated as (n - 1) // 2, which is the integer division of (n - 1) by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
