Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a range of 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are in the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
- For each tuple in `test_cases`, `n` is equal to `k`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('YES')
```

The `print` statement does not depend on any variables or conditions from the initial state. It simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
