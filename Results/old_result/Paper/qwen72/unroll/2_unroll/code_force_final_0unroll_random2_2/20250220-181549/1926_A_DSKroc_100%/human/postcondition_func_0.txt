The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the most frequent character to standard output. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
