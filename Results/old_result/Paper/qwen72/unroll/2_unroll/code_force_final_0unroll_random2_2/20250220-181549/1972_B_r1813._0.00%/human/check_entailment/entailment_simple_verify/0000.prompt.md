You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the initial state of the coins.

    #State: The `index` is `t * 2 + 1`. The `results` list contains `t` elements, each either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The `data` list remains unchanged. The `t` variable remains the same as its initial value.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The `index` is `t * 2 + 1`. The `results` list remains unchanged, containing `t` elements, each either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether the count of 'U' in each string `s` is odd or even, respectively. The `data` list remains unchanged. The `t` variable remains the same as its initial value.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, it only checks the parity of the number of facing-up coins (`num_up_coins % 2 == 1`) to determine the winner, which is insufficient to capture the game's rules and optimal play strategy.

**Counterexample:**

Consider the following input:
```
1
3
UUD
```

According to the program:
- The number of facing-up coins is 2, which is even.
- The program will output "NO", indicating that Bob wins.

However, if we simulate the game:
1. Alice chooses the first coin (U), removes it, and flips the adjacent coins (U to D and D to U). The string becomes "DUD".
2. Bob chooses the middle coin (U), removes it, and flips the adjacent coins (D to U and D to U). The string becomes "UU".
3. Alice chooses the first coin (U), removes it, and the second coin is not flipped (as it would be flipped twice). The string becomes "U".
4. Alice chooses the last coin (U), removes it, and the game ends with no coins left.
5. Bob has no coins to choose, so Alice wins.

The correct output for this case should be "YES", but the program outputs "NO". Therefore, the program is incorrect.
