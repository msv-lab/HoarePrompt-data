Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. The function should be called in a loop or similar structure to process each test case.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop will have processed `n` test cases, where for each test case: if the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest or largest version of the string `s` depending on whether `s` is already sorted in ascending order or not. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated for each iteration based on the current string `s`, but their values will not persist outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each with a string `s` of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. It reads the number of test cases `n` from the input, and for each test case, it reads a string `s`. If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest version of the string if `s` is not already sorted in ascending order, or the lexicographically largest version of the string if `s` is already sorted in ascending order. The function does not return any values, and the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are local to each iteration of the loop and do not persist outside of it.
