### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and the array `a`.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum subarray sum `t` using a running sum `tmp`. This is done to find the maximum possible sum that can be added to the array in one operation.
   - If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to 0, ensuring that only positive contributions to the subarray sum are considered.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `((s + t) % MOD + MOD) % MOD`. This ensures that the sum is positive and within the modulo range.

5. **Multiple Operations:**
   - For each of the remaining `k-1` operations, the maximum subarray sum `t` is doubled and added to `ans`. This is because the maximum subarray sum can be added to the array multiple times, and each time it is added, it can be added again to the new sum.
   - The result is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it stays within the required range.

6. **Output:**
   - The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Sum Calculation:**
  - The sum `s` of the array `a` is correctly calculated using `sum(a)`.

- **Correctness of Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
  - The maximum subarray sum `t` is correctly calculated using a running sum `tmp` and resetting `tmp` to 0 if it becomes negative. This ensures that only the maximum possible contiguous subarray sum is considered.

- **Correctness of Initial Answer Calculation:**
  - The initial answer `ans` is correctly calculated by adding the sum `s` and the maximum subarray sum `t`, and then taking the result modulo `MOD`.

- **Correctness of Multiple Operations:**
  - The program correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for each of the remaining `k-1` operations and adds it to `ans`. This is because the maximum subarray sum can be added to the array multiple times, and each time it is added, it can be added again to the new sum.
  - The result is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it stays within the required range.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after `k` operations, and it handles the modulo operation correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
