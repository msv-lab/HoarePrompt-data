Functionality: ** The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of digits from the user, `a` and `b`, and modifies them such that for the first position where the digits differ, if the digit in `a` is less than the digit in `b`, they are swapped. After the first swap or if the digit in `a` is greater than the digit in `b` at any point, no further swaps occur. The function then prints the modified `a` and `b` strings, each on a new line, followed by a blank line. **
