It appears there's a mismatch between the provided function definition and the problem description. The problem description outlines a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end)` that takes two parameters, `start` and `end`, while the function definition provided is `def func_1():` which does not take any parameters. To correctly address the problem, I'll assume the function definition should match the problem description. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```
def generate_files_for_html_in_range(start, end):
```

Precondition: **start and end are integers such that 0 <= start <= end.**
