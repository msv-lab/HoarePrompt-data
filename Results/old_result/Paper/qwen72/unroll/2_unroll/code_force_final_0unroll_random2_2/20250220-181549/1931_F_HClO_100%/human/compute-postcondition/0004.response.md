The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. Instead, it is designed to read input from a predefined method or standard input. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with two integers `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5` and `n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5`. Each of the following `k` lines contains `n` integers representing the order of participants as seen by the participant who posted the screenshot. Each integer in the screenshot is unique and within the range `[1, n]`. The total number of test cases, `t`, is such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, and the sum of `n · k` across all test cases does not exceed `2 · 10^5`.

The function processes each test case and returns the result for each test case. The exact return value for each test case is not specified in the constraints, but it is implied that the function will return a result based on the input data.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input or a predefined method. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` lines of `n` unique integers each. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each test case.**
