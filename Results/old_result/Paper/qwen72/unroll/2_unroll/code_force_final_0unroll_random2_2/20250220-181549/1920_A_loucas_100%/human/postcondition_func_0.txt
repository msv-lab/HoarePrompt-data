The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by a number of constraints. For each test case, it reads the constraints and categorizes them into three lists: `big` for constraints where `x == 1`, `less` for constraints where `x == 2`, and `no` for constraints where `x == 3`. It then calculates the number of integers that are greater than or equal to the maximum value in `big` and less than or equal to the minimum value in `less`. If this number is less than 1, it prints 0. Otherwise, it subtracts the count of values in `no` that fall within this range and prints the final result. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. The state of the input variables `t`, `n`, and the constraints for each test case remains unchanged.
