The values of `n` and `x` are updated by the function `func_3()`. The function `func_3()` returns two values, which are assigned to `n` and `x` respectively. The list `a` remains unchanged. The new values of `n` and `x` are specific to the return values of `func_3()`, and the precondition that `n` and `x` are integers and `a` is a list of `n` integers still holds.

Output State: **`n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by `func_3()`, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 â‰¤ a_i < 2^30.**
