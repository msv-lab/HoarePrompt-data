Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided by the user input, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 1.**

The initial state remains unchanged except that the variable `curr_v` is now assigned the value 1.
