You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` from standard input, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints the most frequent character to standard output. If the counts of 'A' and 'B' are equal, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value, and the value of `t` remains unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string, and then prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic handles all edge cases, such as when the string contains an equal number of 'A' and 'B' (it will print 'B' in such cases, which is acceptable as 'B' is not less frequent than 'A'). The program also correctly handles the constraints, including the length of the string and the number of test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
