Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

# Program:
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer from the user, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads a string `s` from the user, shuffles the characters of `s` to create a new string `s2`, and prints 'Yes' followed by `s2` if `s2` is different from `s`. If `s2` is the same as `s`, it prints 'No'. After the loop completes, the final state of the program includes the values of `s` and `s2` from the last iteration, but these are not returned or used outside the function. The function does not return any value.


# Your response:
Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
