Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting only of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. It computes a list `ans` of length `n` where each element represents the difference between the cumulative sum of the indices of '<' characters and the cumulative sum of the indices of '>' characters, adjusted based on the conditions inside the loop. After the function concludes, `ans` is printed as a list of integers, and the internal state of the function is such that `preOne` is an empty list, `totalOne` is 0, and `suffZero` is a list with a single element 0. **
