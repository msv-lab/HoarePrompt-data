### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Value of `ans`:**
   - The initial value of `ans` is set to `n`. This is correct because for \(b = 1\), the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is always true (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1). Therefore, there are exactly `n` valid pairs \((a, 1)\) for \(1 \le a \le n\).

2. **Loop for \(b\):**
   - The loop iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m) + 1\). This is incorrect because \(b\) should only go up to \(m\), not \(\min(n, m) + 1\). The correct range should be from 2 to \(m\).

3. **Formula Used in the Loop:**
   - The formula used in the loop is `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`. This formula is incorrect for the given problem. The correct approach should involve checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for each \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The current formula \((n + b) // (b * b)\) does not correctly count the valid pairs. It seems to be an attempt to count the number of \(a\) values for each \(b\), but it does not account for the \(\gcd\) condition.

4. **Correct Formula:**
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current implementation does not perform this check. Instead, it uses a formula that does not align with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program is incorrect because:
- The loop for \(b\) goes beyond the valid range.
- The formula used to update `ans` does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Final: **False**
