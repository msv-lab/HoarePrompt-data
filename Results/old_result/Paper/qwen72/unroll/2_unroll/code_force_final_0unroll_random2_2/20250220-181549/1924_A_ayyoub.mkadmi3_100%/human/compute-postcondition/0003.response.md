To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`, so the loop will execute if `s` is not empty. Given the state before the loop, `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. This means `s` is already non-empty, so the loop will execute as long as `s` is not an empty string.

However, the state provided does not explicitly state that `s` is non-empty. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that `s` has at least one character. The variable `i` will take the value of the first character in `s` at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets and must have at least one character, `i` is the first character in `s`, `s1` is an empty string, `s2` is an empty string, `alphabet` is a set containing the first k lowercase English alphabets**
