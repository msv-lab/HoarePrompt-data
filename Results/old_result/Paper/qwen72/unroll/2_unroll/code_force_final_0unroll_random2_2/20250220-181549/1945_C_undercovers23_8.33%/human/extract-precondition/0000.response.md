Precondition: **The function should be called with no arguments, and it should internally handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident who wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident who wants to live on the right side. The function should read the input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), and each subsequent test case is described by two lines: the first line contains n, and the second line contains the string a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
