Output State: **The variable `x` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ x < 2^30, `t` is an input integer. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, the binary representation of `x` has been modified according to the rules specified in the loop. The length of the modified binary representation is printed, followed by the modified binary digits. The final state of `x` is not preserved, and the list `s` contains the modified binary representation of the last input `x`.**
