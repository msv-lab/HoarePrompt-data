### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` (the number of participants and the number of screenshots).
   - It then reads the `k` lines of input, each containing `n` integers representing the order of participants as seen by the participant who posted the screenshot.

2. **Single Screenshot Case**:
   - If `k` is 1, the function immediately prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because a single screenshot always corresponds to a valid order.

3. **Two Screenshot Case**:
   - The function reads the first two screenshots and extracts the author and the list of other participants.
   - It then compares the lists `l1` and `l2` after removing the author from each list.
   - If `l11` (list `l1` without `a2`) and `l22` (list `l2` without `a1`) are not equal, it prints 'no' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the lists are not equal, there is no consistent order.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are equal, it checks the positions of `a1` and `a2` in the lists to determine if they can be inserted to make the lists consistent.
   - If `m` is 2, it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if only two screenshots are provided and they are consistent, the order is valid.

4. **Multiple Screenshot Case**:
   - If `m` is greater than 2, the function reads the remaining screenshots and stores them in a list `val`.
   - It then iterates through the stored screenshots to check if they are consistent with the modified list `l`.
   - If any screenshot is not consistent, it prints 'no' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If all screenshots are consistent, it prints 'yes'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as `k` being 1 or 2 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the lists are already consistent or can be made consistent by inserting a single participant.

### Correctness:
The function appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if the order of participants in the screenshots can be made consistent. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and correctly processes each test case.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
