### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The program checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the Split Point:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program attempts to find a split point `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.
   - This split point is where the array can be divided into a prefix and a suffix.

4. **Checking the New Array:**
   - The program then creates a new array by swapping the prefix and suffix.
   - It checks if the new array is sorted in non-decreasing order by ensuring:
     - All elements in the new suffix (which was the original prefix) are greater than or equal to the first element of the original array.
     - The new array (after the swap) is sorted in non-decreasing order.

5. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.
   - If not, it prints 'NO'.

### Issues:
- The program has a logical flaw in the way it checks the new array after the split.
- Specifically, the condition `all([(a[0] >= new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])` is incorrect. It should check if the last element of the new prefix (which was the original suffix) is less than or equal to the first element of the new suffix (which was the original prefix).
- Additionally, the program breaks out of the loop after the first split point is found, which means it does not check all possible split points.

### Corrected Logic:
- Instead of breaking after the first split point, the program should continue to check all possible split points.
- The correct condition to check is whether the new array formed by swapping the prefix and suffix is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Correctness:
- The program as written is **incorrect** because it does not correctly handle all possible split points and has a flawed condition for checking the new array.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        check_all = all([(a[i - 1] <= a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
        
        if check_all:
            print('YES')
        else:
            found = False
            for i in range(1, n):
                if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                    new = a[i:] + a[:i]
                    check_all_new = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
                    if check_all_new:
                        print('YES')
                        found = True
                        break
            if not found:
                print('NO')
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
