Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The expected value for each friendship pair should be the initial value `f` plus the expected number of times the pair is chosen over `k` excursions.
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\), where \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) is the total number of possible pairs of children.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function correctly initializes `result` to 0.
     - It iterates over each friendship pair and adds the product of the initial friendship value `f` and the sum of the first `k` natural numbers \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\) to `result`.
     - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
     - The function returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.
     - It reads the `m` friendship pairs and stores them in a list `friendships`.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.

3. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - **Function 1**:
     - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers \(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\) is correctly calculated.
     - However, the program incorrectly assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion. This is not true. The correct expected value for each friendship pair should be \(f + \frac{k \cdot f}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
     - The current implementation multiplies the initial friendship value `f` by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of each pair being chosen.
     - The correct approach should be to calculate the expected value for each friendship pair and sum these expected values.

   - **Function 2**:
     - The input reading and test case handling are correct.
     - The call to `func_1` is correct, but the function itself is incorrect.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It assumes each pair is chosen in every excursion, which is not the case. The correct calculation involves the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.

Final: **False**
