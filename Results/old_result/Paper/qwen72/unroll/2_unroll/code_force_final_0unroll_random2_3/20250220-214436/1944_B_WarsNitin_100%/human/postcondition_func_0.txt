The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list `a` of integers of length 2n (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). For each test case, it finds two subsets `ans1` and `ans2` of length 2k from the first and second halves of `a`, respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans2`. The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been updated and reset for each new test case.
