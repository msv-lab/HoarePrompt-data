You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` with elements greater than 0, and `q` queries. The input is provided in a specific format: the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` test cases. Each test case starts with two integers `n` and `q` (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), followed by `n` integers `c_1, c_2, ..., c_n` (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and then `q` lines each containing two integers `l_i` and `r_i` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n) representing the borders of the subarray for the i-th query. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        p = []
        
        c = 0
        
        for x in l:
            c += x
            p.append(c)
        
        for _ in range(m):
            a, b = map(int, input().split())
            s = p[b - 1]
            if a - 2 >= 0:
                s -= p[a - 2]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s >= 2 * (b - a + 1):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has processed all test cases. For each query, it has determined whether the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` is at least twice the length of the subarray, and printed 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `l` are no longer in scope, and the final state of the program is that all input has been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray has only one element. According to the problem description, a subarray is considered good if there exists an array `b` such that the sum of elements in `b` equals the sum of elements in the subarray, and each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in the subarray and is greater than 0. For a subarray with a single element, it is impossible to construct such an array `b` because the only way to have a different positive integer is to either increase or decrease the value, which would change the sum. Therefore, any subarray with a single element should always return "NO". However, the program does not account for this and may incorrectly return "YES" in some cases.

Example Input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 1
4 4
3 3
5 5
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
NO
NO
NO
```

Actual Output (from the program):
```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

This shows that the program fails to handle subarrays with a single element correctly.
