The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 20. For each iteration, the function reads an integer `n` from the user input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The function prints a specific pattern of '##' and '.' characters based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of '##'. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines of '##..' followed by four lines of '..##'. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines of '##..##' followed by six lines of '..##..'. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines of '##..##..' followed by eight lines of '..##..##'. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `casos` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` will be the last input provided.
