You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = input()
        l = 0
        h = 0
        for j in a:
            if j == 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is a distinct string of length 5 consisting of the letters 'A' and 'B'. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer between 1 and 32. For each test case, the function counts the number of 'A's and 'B's in the string. If the number of 'A's is greater than the number of 'B's, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed a result ('A' or 'B') for each one, and the variables `l` and `h` are reset to 0 for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the first line of input contains the number of test cases.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `t` times, which is correct as it needs to process each test case.

3. **Reading Each String**: Inside the loop, the program reads a string `a` of length 5, which is also consistent with the problem description.

4. **Counting Characters**: The program initializes two counters, `l` for counting 'A's and `h` for counting 'B's. It then iterates through each character in the string `a`:
   - If the character is 'A', it increments `l`.
   - If the character is 'B', it increments `h`.

5. **Determining the Most Frequent Character**: After counting the characters, the program checks which counter is greater:
   - If `l` (the count of 'A's) is greater than `h` (the count of 'B's), it prints 'A'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'B'.

6. **Output**: The program prints the most frequent character for each test case, which is the expected output according to the problem description.

The program correctly follows the logic and steps required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the character counting and comparison logic is correct.
