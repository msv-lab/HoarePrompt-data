#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.
def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
        
    #State: s1 is a string containing all characters from s that are in the initial alphabet set, with each character appearing only once. s2 is a string containing the last character of s that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated n times. The alphabet set is reset to its initial state containing the first k lowercase English alphabets.
    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2` which contains the last character of `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and two integers `k` and `n`. It processes `s` to create a string `s1` that contains each of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets from `s` at most once, and a string `s2` that consists of the last character from `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the quotient of the length of `s1` divided by `k`), and the string `s2`.
