### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic for Calculating Valid Pairs**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - However, the logic used in the program is incorrect. The nested loop that was commented out:
     ```python
     'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
     ```
     This loop was intended to check each pair `(i, j)` but was commented out and not used.

3. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The actual logic used in the program is:
     ```python
     suma = 0
     for i in range(1, b + 1):
         x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
         if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
             suma += x
     print(suma - 1)
     ```
   - This logic does not correctly implement the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The expression `(a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correspond to the problem's requirements and is likely a mistake.

4. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all pairs `(a, b)` and checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The commented-out loop was on the right track but was not properly implemented and was not used.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints `suma - 1` for each test case, which is not the correct number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
