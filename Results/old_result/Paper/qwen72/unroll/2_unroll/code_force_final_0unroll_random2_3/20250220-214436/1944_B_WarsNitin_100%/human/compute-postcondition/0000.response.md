Output State: **The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `k`, where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, containing each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. `t` is now an input integer.**
