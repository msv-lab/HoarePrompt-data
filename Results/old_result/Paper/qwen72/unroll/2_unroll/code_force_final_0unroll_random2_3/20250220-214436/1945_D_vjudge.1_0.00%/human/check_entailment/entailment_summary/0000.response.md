### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. It then reads two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` from input, representing the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.
   - **Reversing Lists**: The function reverses both `lista_A` and `lista_B`. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to process the queue from the end to the beginning, which is necessary for calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - **Cost Calculation**:
     - The function initializes `soma_b` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the costs `b_i` for positions that Kirill moves through.
     - It also initializes `pref` to 0, which will be used to accumulate the costs `a_i` for positions where Kirill can move to.
     - The function iterates over the range `0` to `n - k - 1` (i.e., the positions from the end of the queue that are beyond the first `m` positions). For each position `i`:
       - If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, it means Kirill can move to position `i` with a lower cost `a_i` than the cumulative cost `soma_b`. In this case, `pref` is updated by adding `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]`, and `soma_b` is reset to 0.
       - Otherwise, `soma_b` is updated by adding `lista_B[i]`.
     - After processing the positions beyond the first `m` positions, the function calculates the minimum cost `resultado` for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions by iterating over the range `n - k` to `n - 1` and updating `resultado` with the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
     - Finally, the function prints `resultado`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `numero_testes` from input, representing the number of test cases.
   - **Test Case Execution**: The function then iterates `numero_testes` times, calling `func_1` for each test case. This ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Analysis:
- **Reversing the Lists**: Reversing the lists is a key step because it allows the function to process the queue from the end to the beginning, which is necessary for calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
- **Cost Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each position and updating the cumulative costs accordingly.
- **Test Case Handling**: The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes the input data, reverses the lists, calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions, and handles multiple test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
