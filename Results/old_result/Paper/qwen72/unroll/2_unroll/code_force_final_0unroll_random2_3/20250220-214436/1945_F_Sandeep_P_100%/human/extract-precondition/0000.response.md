The provided function `decorating_function` is not directly related to the problem of helping Kirill gather mushrooms to brew an elixir. It appears to be a decorator function, which is used to wrap another function to extend its behavior. However, since the task is to extract a precondition based on the variables in the function signature, I will provide a precondition for the `decorating_function` as requested.

Precondition: **user_function is a callable function.**
