Reasoning:

The problem statement and the example provided are about finding the year when the n-th sign of the apocalypse will occur, given the periodicity of each sign. The signs must occur sequentially, and the year for each subsequent sign must be strictly after the year of the previous sign.

However, the provided Python program does not solve this problem. Instead, it seems to be a solution for a different problem, possibly a pathfinding or sequence optimization problem, where the path is a list of strings that can be either '@', '*', or some other character. The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum number of '@' characters that can be collected while avoiding '*' characters, which is not related to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign of the apocalypse.

### Key Issues:
1. **Functionality Mismatch**: The function `func_1` is not designed to solve the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign. It is instead solving a problem related to path optimization.
2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1`, but it does not handle the input as described in the problem. It should be reading the periodicities of the signs and not a path of characters.
3. **Output Mismatch**: The output of `func_1` is the maximum number of '@' characters collected, which is not the year of the n-th sign.

### Expected Solution:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases.
- For each test case, read the number of signs and their periodicities.
- Calculate the year when the n-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- Output the year for each test case.

### Correctness:
Given the mismatch between the problem description and the provided program, the program is incorrect for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
