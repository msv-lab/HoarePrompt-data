The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it interacts with a sequence of queries and responses. It must determine a pair of indices (i, j) from a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1} such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" where 0 â‰¤ a, b, c, d < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4. The function returns a pair of indices (i, j) that maximize the XOR value of p_i and p_j.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find a pair of indices (i, j) from a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1} such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. It returns the pair of indices (i, j) that achieve this maximum XOR value.**
