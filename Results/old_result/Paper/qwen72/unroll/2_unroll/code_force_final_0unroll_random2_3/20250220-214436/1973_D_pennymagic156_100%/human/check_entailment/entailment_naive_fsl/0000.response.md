Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `k = 1`. According to the problem description, when `k = 1`, the value of `m` should always be `f(1, n)`, which is the maximum value in the array `a` multiplied by the length of the array `n`. However, the program does not directly handle this case and instead tries to find a valid split for `k` subarrays, which may not always work as expected for `k = 1`.

For example, consider the following test case:
- `n = 5`, `k = 1`, and the hidden array `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

The correct answer should be `m = 5 * 5 = 25` because `f(1, 5) = 5 * 5 = 25`. However, the program will not necessarily find this value because it tries to split the array into `k` subarrays, which is unnecessary and may lead to incorrect results when `k = 1`.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where no valid `m` exists. The logic for determining when to output `-1` is not robust and may miss cases where no valid split is possible.
