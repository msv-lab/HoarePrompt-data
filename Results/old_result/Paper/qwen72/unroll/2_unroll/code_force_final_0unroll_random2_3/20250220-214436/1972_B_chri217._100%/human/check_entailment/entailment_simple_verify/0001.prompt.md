You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

    #State: t is an integer read from the standard input and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace, and for each case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D". `cases` is a list containing t tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer n and a string s.
    return cases
    #The program returns the list `cases` which contains `t` tuples. Each tuple in the list consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D".

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list where case[0] is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and case[1] is a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin.
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string `s` is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (the number of coins) and a string `s` (the initial state of the coins).
   - The function appends each test case as a tuple `(n, s)` to the list `cases` and returns this list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Winning Condition**:
   - `func_2` takes a single test case `(n, s)` as input.
   - It counts the number of coins facing up (`'U'`) using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - The function then checks if the number of facing-up coins is odd (`ups % 2` is `1`). If it is, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins.
   - The logic here is based on the observation that the game is essentially a parity game. Each move removes one facing-up coin and flips two adjacent coins, which means the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins changes with each move. Therefore, if the initial number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will always have the last move and win. If it is even, Bob will have the last move and win.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The problem states that the game will end in a finite number of operations and one of them will win. This is consistent with the parity logic.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins initially, which would result in an immediate loss for the player whose turn it is.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns "YES" if Alice wins and "NO" if Bob wins, which matches the required output format.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
