### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program contains a commented-out section that attempts to use a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(i\) and \(j\), but this section is not executed.
   - The actual algorithm used is:
     - It iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
     - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x\) as \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\).
     - If \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\), it adds \(x\) to the sum \(suma\).
     - Finally, it prints \(suma - 1\).

4. **Correctness of the Optimization**:
   - The optimization step is based on a mathematical insight, but it needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure it correctly counts the valid pairs.
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is derived from the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - For \(a + b\) to be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), \(a + b\) must be divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This implies that \(a\) must be of the form \(k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b) - b\) for some integer \(k\).
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) is an attempt to count the number of valid \(a\) values for each \(b = i\). However, it is not clear if this formula is mathematically sound and correctly counts all valid pairs.

5. **Flaws in the Optimization**:
   - The formula \((a - i \cdot (i - 1)) // i^2 + 1\) does not directly correspond to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The subtraction of 1 at the end (\(suma - 1\)) is not justified in the context of the problem.
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition for all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's logic for counting valid pairs is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The optimization step is flawed and does not align with the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required condition and the optimization step is flawed, leading to incorrect results.
