Output State: **`r` is a list of integers, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + (r[5] - 1)`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - (r[5] - 1)`, `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1`, `y2` is equal to 1, `a` is equal to `r[5] - 1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number. `t` is equal to `abs(1 - (r[3] - 1))`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.**
