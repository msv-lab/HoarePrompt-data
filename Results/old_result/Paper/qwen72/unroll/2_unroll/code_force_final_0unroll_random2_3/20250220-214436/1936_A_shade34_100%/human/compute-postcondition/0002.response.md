The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. It is designed to work with a sequence `p` which is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1}, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function aims to find the indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j`. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find and return the indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) that maximize the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j`, where `p` is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries to find these indices.**
