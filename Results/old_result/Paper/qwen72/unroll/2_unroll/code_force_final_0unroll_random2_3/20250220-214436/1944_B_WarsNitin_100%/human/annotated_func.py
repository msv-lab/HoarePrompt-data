#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `k`, where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, containing each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, the function needs to find two subsets `l` and `r` of length 2k from the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been updated for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, `ans1` and `ans2` will contain the elements from the sorted halves of the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, and these lists will be printed. The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the final values of `t` and `q` will be the same as the initial values, while `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list `a` of integers of length 2n (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). For each test case, it finds two subsets `ans1` and `ans2` of length 2k from the first and second halves of `a`, respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans2`. The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been updated and reset for each new test case.
