Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem requires calculating the year when the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the program `func_1` and `func_2` are solving a different problem involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is unrelated to the periodic occurrences of signs. The annotations confirm that the program is constructing a dynamic programming array `dp` based on the characters in `path`, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
