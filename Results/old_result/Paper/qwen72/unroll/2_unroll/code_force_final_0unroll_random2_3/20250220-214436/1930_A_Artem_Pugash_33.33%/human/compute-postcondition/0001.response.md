The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `numCases`. The loop will execute if `numCases` is greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `numCases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be set to 0 by the loop on the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `numCases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
