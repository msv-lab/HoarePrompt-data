Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, which is not the same as finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.

The correct approach to minimize the penalty involves splitting the array such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible. The program should consider all possible splits and calculate the penalty for each split to find the minimum penalty.

Here is a corrected version of the program that correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    expression = input().strip()
    print(min_penalty(expression))

def min_penalty(expression):
    n = len(expression)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    prefix_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_sum += 1 if expression[i - 1] == '+' else -1
        dp[i] = abs(prefix_sum) * i
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + abs(prefix_sum - (dp[i] - dp[j - 1])) * (i - j + 1))
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage:
# t = 5
# test_cases = ["+", "-----", "+-+-+-", "--+++++++-", "+---++++-+++++---++-"]
# for case in test_cases:
#     print(min_penalty(case))
```

This dynamic programming approach ensures that the minimum penalty is calculated by considering all possible splits of the array. The `dp` array keeps track of the minimum penalty up to each index, and the inner loop iterates through all possible previous split points to update the current minimum penalty.
