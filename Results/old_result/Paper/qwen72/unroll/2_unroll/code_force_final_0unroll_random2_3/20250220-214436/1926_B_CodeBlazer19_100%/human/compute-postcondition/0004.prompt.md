You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and a list of `n` strings, each string containing `n` characters of '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square, and the shape's size is greater than 1.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = 0
        
        b = ''
        
        for j in range(n):
            s = input()
            if s.count('1') == 1:
                a = 'TRIANGLE'
            elif s.count('1') > 1:
                b = 'SQUARE'
        
        if a != 0:
            print(a)
        else:
            print(b)
        
    #State: The loop will print 'TRIANGLE' or 'SQUARE' for each test case based on the shape found in the grid. The variable `a` will be set to 'TRIANGLE' if a triangle is found, and `b` will be set to 'SQUARE' if a square is found. After all iterations, the values of `t` and `n` will remain unchanged, and `a` and `b` will be reset for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). It returns "triangle" if the grid contains a triangle, and "square" if the grid contains a square.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
