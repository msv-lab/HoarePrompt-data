The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` which contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case, while `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains three integers (n, x, y) and a list of n integers. The function returns a list `results` where each element is the count of beautiful pairs for the corresponding test case, and `test_cases` remains unchanged.**
