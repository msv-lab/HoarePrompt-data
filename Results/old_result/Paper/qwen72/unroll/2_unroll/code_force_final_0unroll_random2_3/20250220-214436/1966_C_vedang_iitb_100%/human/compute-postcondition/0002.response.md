Output State: **The variable `t` is unchanged, and the list `test_cases` is also unchanged. The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case and printing either 'Alice' or 'Bob' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The internal variables `n`, `a`, `maxsize`, and `mexsize` are updated and used within each iteration but do not persist outside the loop.**
