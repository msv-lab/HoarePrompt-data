The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n` and `info` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is still an integer in the range 3 to 78 for each test case, `info` is an empty list**
