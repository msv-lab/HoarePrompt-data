Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. The logic of the program is to:

1. Sort the array of card counts.
2. Iterate through the sorted array to find the point where the difference in counts between consecutive card types exceeds the available coins to equalize them.
3. Calculate the maximum score based on the number of cards that can be bought to equalize the counts up to that point, and the remainder of coins that can be used to increase the count of the last card type in the sequence.

The program correctly handles the case where the available coins are not enough to equalize all card counts, and also the case where there are sufficient coins to equalize all card counts and still have some coins left over. The output matches the expected results for the given examples, and the approach is logically sound for the problem constraints.
