To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and its effects on the variables `x` and `y` for each iteration. The loop runs `ap` times, and during each iteration, it reads new values for `x` and `y` from the input, processes them, and prints a result. The values of `x` and `y` are reset at the beginning of each iteration, so the state of these variables after the loop is not affected by the loop's internal operations.

Given the initial state:
- The function takes two non-negative integers `x` and `y` as input, where \(0 \leq x, y \leq 99\), representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.
- `ap` is an input integer.

The loop body does not modify `ap`, and the values of `x` and `y` are re-assigned at the start of each iteration. Therefore, after the loop has finished executing, the values of `x` and `y` will be the same as they were before the loop started, and `ap` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **The values of `x` and `y` are unchanged, and `ap` remains the same.**
