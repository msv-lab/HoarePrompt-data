Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies a potential issue with the program: it does not handle the case where the input array `l` contains duplicate elements. However, the problem description does not explicitly state that the elements in the progressive square must be unique. Instead, it only specifies the construction rules for the progressive square and the need to verify if the elements in `l` can form such a square.

Let's break down the function `func_1` and the program's behavior:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.

2. **Finding the Minimum Element:**
   - The function `func_1` finds the minimum element `a` in the list `l`.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square:**
   - It generates a new list `li` by calculating `a + k * c + d * h` for all `0 <= k, h < n`.
   - This ensures that the elements in `li` follow the progressive square rules based on the minimum element `a`, the constants `c` and `d`, and the size `n`.

4. **Sorting and Comparison:**
   - Both `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The function compares the sorted lists `l` and `li`.

5. **Return Value:**
   - If the sorted lists are equal, the function returns 'yes'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Given the problem description, the key points are:
- The progressive square is constructed using the formula `a + k * c + d * h`.
- The input array `l` should be able to form such a square.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the construction of the progressive square and the comparison with the input array. The issue of duplicate elements is not explicitly mentioned in the problem constraints, and the program's behavior is consistent with the rules provided.

However, if we consider the example test case provided in the original assessment:
```
1
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 6 4 8
```
- The minimum element `a` is 1.
- The generated list `li` would be: `[1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11]`.
- The input list `l` after sorting is: `[1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9]`.

Since `li` does not contain duplicate elements, and `l` does, the comparison will fail, and the function will correctly return 'no'. Therefore, the program does handle the case of duplicate elements by ensuring that the generated list `li` is unique and comparing it with the sorted input list `l`.

Given this reasoning, the original assessment is incorrect because the program does handle the case of duplicate elements and will return 'no' for such inputs.

Final: **True**
