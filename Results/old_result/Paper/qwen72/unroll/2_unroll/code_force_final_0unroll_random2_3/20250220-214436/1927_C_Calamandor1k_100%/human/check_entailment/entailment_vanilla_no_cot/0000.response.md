Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the lengths of arrays `a` and `b` along with the even number `k`. It stores these in a list of tuples `cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - **Unique Elements**: It converts the arrays `a` and `b` into sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` to get the unique elements.
   - **Relevant Elements**: It filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, resulting in sets `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - **Exclusive Elements**: It calculates the elements that are unique to `a` (`only_a`), unique to `b` (`only_b`), and common to both (`both`).
   - **Checking Conditions**:
     - If the number of elements unique to `a` is greater than `k // 2`, it is impossible to choose the required elements, so it appends 'NO' to the results.
     - Similarly, if the number of elements unique to `b` is greater than `k // 2`, it appends 'NO' to the results.
     - If the total number of distinct elements (including those common to both arrays) is less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results.

3. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case.

This logic ensures that the program correctly checks whether it is possible to choose exactly `k // 2` elements from each array such that all integers from 1 to `k` are included among the chosen elements. The conditions are well-handled, and the program should work correctly for the given constraints and examples.
