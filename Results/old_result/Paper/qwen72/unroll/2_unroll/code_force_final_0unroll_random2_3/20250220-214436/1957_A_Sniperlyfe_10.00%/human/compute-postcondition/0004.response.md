The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list in `arr` represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer in each inner list is the number of sticks `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). The function returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4. The `freq` dictionary is assumed to store the frequency of stick lengths across all test cases.
