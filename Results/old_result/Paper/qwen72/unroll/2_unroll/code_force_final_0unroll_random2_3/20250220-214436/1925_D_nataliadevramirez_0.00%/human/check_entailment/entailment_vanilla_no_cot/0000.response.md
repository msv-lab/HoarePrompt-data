Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program provided is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of selecting a pair of friends and the subsequent increase in their friendship value. The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values over all excursions, which involves understanding the probability of selecting each pair and how their friendship values evolve over time.

### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Expected Value:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends and multiplies it by the sum of the first `k` natural numbers. This is incorrect because it assumes that each pair will be chosen in every excursion, which is not the case.
   - The correct approach involves calculating the expected number of times each pair of friends is chosen and then using this to compute the expected increase in their friendship value.

2. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The program uses modular arithmetic correctly, but the logic for calculating the expected value is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
- For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
- The expected number of times a pair of friends is chosen in `k` excursions is \(k \times \frac{2}{n(n-1)}\).
- The expected increase in the friendship value of a pair of friends after being chosen is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\).
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in `k` excursions is the sum of the expected values for each pair of friends.

### Corrected Program:
```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def modinv(x, mod):
    return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)

def func_1(n, m, k, friendships):
    result = 0
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    prob = (2 * k) % MOD * modinv(total_pairs, MOD) % MOD
    for i in range(m):
        (a, b, f) = friendships[i]
        expected_increase = (f * prob * (k + 1)) % MOD
        result = (result + expected_increase) % MOD
    return result

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        print(result)

func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **modinv(x, mod):** This function calculates the modular inverse of `x` under modulo `mod` using Fermat's Little Theorem.
- **total_pairs:** This is the total number of possible pairs of children, which is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
- **prob:** This is the probability of selecting a pair of friends in any given excursion, which is \(\frac{2k}{n(n-1)}\).
- **expected_increase:** This is the expected increase in the friendship value of a pair of friends after `k` excursions, which is \(f \times \frac{2k(k+1)}{n(n-1)}\).
- **result:** This accumulates the expected sum of friendship values for all pairs of friends.

This corrected program should correctly compute the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in `k` excursions.
