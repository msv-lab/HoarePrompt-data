Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It then finds and prints the maximum value among the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the array `a`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state of the program includes the printed results for each test case. The internal variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `max` will hold the values from the last test case processed. **
