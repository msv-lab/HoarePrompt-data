Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons as `t = b // 2 + 1` if `b` is odd. This is incorrect because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the screen has 15 cells. Therefore, the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons should be calculated based on the total number of cells they occupy, not just the number of icons.

2. **Incorrect Calculation for Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the remaining cells available after placing 2x2 icons as `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`. This is correct, but the subsequent logic to determine the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is flawed. Specifically, the program uses `t2 = a - t1` to find the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed, and then it calculates the additional screens needed as `t = t + t2 // 15 + 1` if `t2 % 15 != 0`. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that 1x1 icons can be placed on the same screen as 2x2 icons, and it does not correctly handle the case where the remaining 1x1 icons fit exactly into the remaining cells.

3. **Optimal Placement**:
   - The program does not consider the optimal placement of 1x1 icons on the same screen as 2x2 icons. For example, if there are 1 1x1 icon and 1 2x2 icon, the program should output 1 screen, but it might output more due to the flawed logic.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        # Each screen has 15 cells
        screen_capacity = 15
        
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screens_for_2x2 = (b * 4 + screen_capacity - 1) // screen_capacity
        
        # Calculate the remaining cells after placing 2x2 icons
        remaining_cells = screens_for_2x2 * screen_capacity - b * 4
        
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        additional_screens_for_1x1 = (a - remaining_cells + screen_capacity - 1) // screen_capacity
        
        # Total number of screens needed
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens_for_1x1
        
        print(total_screens)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the number of screens needed for both 2x2 and 1x1 icons, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.
