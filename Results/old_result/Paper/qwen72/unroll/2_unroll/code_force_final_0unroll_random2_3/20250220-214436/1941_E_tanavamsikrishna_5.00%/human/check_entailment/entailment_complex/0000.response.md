Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of minimizing the total cost of installing supports for bridges over a river represented as a grid. The key aspects to evaluate are the correctness of the individual functions and how they work together to solve the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: A list `row` representing the depths of the river cells in a single row, and an integer `d` representing the maximum distance between adjacent supports.
   - **Processing**:
     - The function increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1 to account for the cost of installing supports in these cells.
     - For each subsequent cell in the row, it updates the cell's value to be the minimum of the previous `d` cells (including the incremented first `d-1` cells) plus the current value plus 1. This ensures that the cost of installing a support in each cell is minimized while maintaining the distance constraint.
   - **Output**: The last element of the updated row, which represents the total cost of installing supports in that row.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly computes the minimum cost for a single row according to the problem's constraints. The logic for incrementing the first `d-1` elements and then updating the rest of the row to ensure the distance constraint is met is sound.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: Reads input from the standard input, including the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - **Processing**:
     - It reads the grid `rows` and computes the cost for each row using `func_1`.
     - It then calculates the total cost for each possible sequence of `k` consecutive rows and stores these costs in `total_costs`.
     - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which represents the minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges.
   - **Output**: The minimum total cost of installing supports for `k` consecutive bridges.
   - **Correctness**: The function correctly processes the input, computes the costs for each row, and finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive bridges. The logic for summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows and finding the minimum is correct.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program handles multiple test cases by iterating over the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it uses `func_2` to compute and print the minimum total cost.
   - The input and output formats match the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
