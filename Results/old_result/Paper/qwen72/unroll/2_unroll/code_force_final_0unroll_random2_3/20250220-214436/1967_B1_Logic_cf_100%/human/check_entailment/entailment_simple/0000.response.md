### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step by step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to `n`.

3. **Loop for \(b\):**
   - The program iterates over \(b\) from 2 to \(\min(n, m)\).
   - For each \(b\), it updates `ans` using the formula: `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

#### Issues in the Program:
1. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula used in the loop `ans = ans + (n + b) // (b * b)` is incorrect. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the program does not compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and does not check the condition for each \(a\).

2. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - Initializing `ans` to `n` is incorrect. The correct initialization should be `ans = 0` because we need to count the number of valid pairs, starting from zero.

3. **Loop for \(a\):**
   - The program does not iterate over \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) for each \(b\). This is necessary to check the condition for each possible pair \((a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Initialize `ans` to 0.
2. Iterate over \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. For each \(b\), iterate over \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
4. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
5. If the condition is satisfied, increment `ans`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        [n, m] = input().split()
        [n, m] = [int(n), int(m)]
        
        ans = 0
        
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            for a in range(1, n + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
```

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness: **False**
