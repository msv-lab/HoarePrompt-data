Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the input array `l` contains duplicate elements that cannot form a valid progressive square. For example, consider the following test case:

```
1
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 6 4 8
```

The program will sort the list `l` and `li` and compare them. However, the progressive square should have unique elements, and in this case, the input array `l` contains two `6`s. The program will incorrectly return "yes" for this input, even though a valid progressive square cannot be constructed with duplicate elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
