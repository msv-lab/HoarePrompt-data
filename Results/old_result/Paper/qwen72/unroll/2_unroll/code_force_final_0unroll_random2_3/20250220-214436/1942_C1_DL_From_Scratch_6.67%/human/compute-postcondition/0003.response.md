The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, along with a list of `x` integers. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9.
- `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5).
- `y` is an integer and y = 0.
- The list of `x` integers are distinct and within the range 1 to n.

The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information. However, the functionality can be described based on the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The parameters `t`, `n`, and `x` are constrained to specific ranges, and `y` is fixed to 0. The list of integers must be distinct and within the range 1 to n.**
