### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of friendship pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` for the given pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose a pair of children from `n` children using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is correctly computed as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The formula used in the program to calculate the expected value is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions, considering the increase in friendship value for each chosen pair. However, let's verify the correctness of this formula.

5. **Expected Value Formula Derivation:**
   - For each excursion, the probability of choosing a specific pair of friends is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of a specific pair over `k` excursions is \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The total expected increase in the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions for all pairs of friends is:
     \[
     m \cdot \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \cdot k = \frac{m \cdot k^2}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - The initial sum of friendship values is `sum_f`.
   - Therefore, the total expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \text{sum\_f} + \frac{m \cdot k^2}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - Simplifying the formula, we get:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{\binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k^2}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - This can be further simplified to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + 2 \cdot m \cdot k^2}{n \cdot (n - 1)}
     \]

6. **Comparison with Program Formula:**
   - The program's formula is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + 2 \cdot m \cdot k^2}{n \cdot (n - 1)}
     \]
   - The program's formula includes an extra factor of `2 * k` in the numerator and an extra factor of `2 * cn2` in the denominator, which is not correct.

7. **Simplification and Modulo Inverse:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

8. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no friends (`m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value will be 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the friendship value will increase linearly.

### Conclusion:
The program's formula for calculating the expected value is incorrect. The correct formula should be:
\[
\text{Expected Value} = \frac{n \cdot (n - 1) \cdot \text{sum\_f} + 2 \cdot m \cdot k^2}{n \cdot (n - 1)}
\]
Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
