### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `n`, `m`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` which represent the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Initial Position Check**:
   - The program checks if `x2 <= x1`. If this is true, it means Bob is already in or above Alice's row, and since Bob moves up, he cannot move down to Alice's row. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.

3. **Odd and Even Distance Check**:
   - The program then checks if the distance between Alice's and Bob's rows `(x2 - x1)` is odd or even.
   - If the distance is odd, Alice has the first move and can potentially win if she can align her chip with Bob's chip in the same column. The program correctly handles this by checking if `y1 == y2` and if Alice can move to the same column as Bob in the next move.
   - If the distance is even, Bob has the first move and can potentially win if he can align his chip with Alice's chip in the same column. The program correctly handles this by checking if `y1 == y2` and if Bob can move to the same column as Alice in the next move.

4. **Move Simulation**:
   - The program simulates the moves by adjusting the positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
   - It calculates the number of moves `a` that Alice or Bob can make to align their chips in the same column.
   - It then checks if the alignment is possible and if the new positions are within the board boundaries.

5. **Winning Conditions**:
   - If Alice or Bob can align their chips in the same column and the new positions are within the board boundaries, the program correctly outputs "Alice" or "Bob" respectively.
   - If the alignment is not possible or the new positions are out of bounds, the program correctly outputs "Draw".

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row, Bob in the first row) by outputting "Draw".

### Correctness:
After reviewing the program and the problem description, the program appears to correctly handle the game logic and all the edge cases. However, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Function Call Order**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will cause a runtime error. The function should be defined before it is called.
- **Logic for Even Distance**: The logic for the even distance case seems to have some issues. Specifically, the conditions for determining the winner are not clearly correct and may need to be reviewed.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands.

### Correctness: **False**
