Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**: The program initializes `nums` as a list of the first 21 powers of 2, which are `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20]`. This list is used to ensure that all numbers from 1 to \(2^{21} - 1\) can be formed as a sum of some subset of these numbers.

2. **Finding the index `idx`**: The program iterates through the `nums` list to find the largest index `idx` such that `nums[idx]` is less than or equal to `k`. This is done to identify the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying `nums`**:
   - The element `2^idx` is removed from the list.
   - Three new elements are appended to the list: `(k - 2^idx)`, `(k + 1)`, and `(k + 2^idx + 1)`.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the modified `nums` list is printed.
   - The elements of the modified `nums` list are printed.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Condition 1: No subsequence of `a` should sum to `k`**:
  - By removing `2^idx` and adding `(k - 2^idx)`, the program ensures that the sum of any subset of the modified `nums` list will not be exactly `k`. This is because the sum of the remaining elements in `nums` up to `2^idx` can form any number up to `2^idx - 1`, and the addition of `(k - 2^idx)` ensures that the sum of any subset will either be less than `k` or greater than `k`.

- **Condition 2: For all \(1 \le v \le n\) where \(v \ne k\), there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`**:
  - The elements `(k + 1)` and `(k + 2^idx + 1)` are added to ensure that all numbers greater than `k` can be formed. The remaining elements in `nums` (which are powers of 2 up to `2^20` excluding `2^idx`) can form any number up to \(2^{21} - 1\) except `k`.
  - The addition of `(k - 2^idx)` ensures that all numbers less than `k` can be formed by combining this element with the remaining powers of 2.

- **Size of the sequence**:
  - The modified `nums` list will have 23 elements, which is within the allowed size of 25.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1: \(n = 2, k = 2\)**:
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20]`
  - `idx` is 1 (since `2^1 = 2` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 2).
  - Modified `nums`: `[1, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20, 0, 3, 4]`
  - Output: `23` and the elements of the modified `nums` list.
  - This satisfies the conditions because no subsequence sums to 2, and all numbers from 1 to 2 (excluding 2) can be formed.

- **Test Case 2: \(n = 6, k = 1\)**:
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20]`
  - `idx` is 0 (since `2^0 = 1` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 1).
  - Modified `nums`: `[2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20, 0, 2, 3]`
  - Output: `23` and the elements of the modified `nums` list.
  - This satisfies the conditions because no subsequence sums to 1, and all numbers from 1 to 6 (excluding 1) can be formed.

- **Test Case 3: \(n = 8, k = 8\)**:
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20]`
  - `idx` is 3 (since `2^3 = 8` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 8).
  - Modified `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, 16, ..., 2^20, 0, 9, 17]`
  - Output: `23` and the elements of the modified `nums` list.
  - This satisfies the conditions because no subsequence sums to 8, and all numbers from 1 to 8 (excluding 8) can be formed.

- **Test Case 4: \(n = 9, k = 3\)**:
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20]`
  - `idx` is 1 (since `2^1 = 2` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 3).
  - Modified `nums`: `[1, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20, 1, 4, 6]`
  - Output: `23` and the elements of the modified `nums` list.
  - This satisfies the conditions because no subsequence sums to 3, and all numbers from 1 to 9 (excluding 3) can be formed.

- **Test Case 5: \(n = 10, k = 7\)**:
  - Initial `nums`: `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^20]`
  - `idx` is 2 (since `2^2 = 4` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 7).
  - Modified `nums`: `[1, 2, 8, 16, ..., 2^20, 3, 8, 12]`
  - Output: `23` and the elements of the modified `nums` list.
  - This satisfies the conditions because no subsequence sums to 7, and all numbers from 1 to 10 (excluding 7) can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements for all test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
