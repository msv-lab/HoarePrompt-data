The only variables in the loop head are `k` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Given the state before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, which means the loop will definitely execute at least once. 

However, the initial state of `k` is not specified, and for the loop to start, `k` must be 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `k` is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `k` is 0**
