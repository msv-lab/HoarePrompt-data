You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    og = str(input())
    og_list = og.split()
    k = int(og_list[0])
    q = int(og_list[1])
    k_wali = str(input())
    k_wali_list = k_wali.split()
    q_wali = str(input())
    q_wali_list = q_wali.split()
    for j in range(len(q_wali_list)):
        print(func_1(int(k_wali_list[0]), int(q_wali_list[j])), end=' ')
    print('\n')

def func_1(a, b):
    if a <= b:
        return a - 1
    else:
        return b



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` integers where `1 ≤ k ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100`, and `b` is a list of `q` integers where `1 ≤ q ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100`. The function returns the list `b` if `a` is not less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the function attempts to return `a - 1`, which will result in a runtime error because the operation is not valid for a list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `k` and `q` from the input.
   - It then reads the sequence `a` of length `k` and the list of `q` values `n_i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(a, b)` is supposed to determine the number of winners when `b` players start the game and the sequence `a` is used to kick out players.
   - The function checks if `a` (the first element of the sequence) is less than or equal to `b` (the number of players).
   - If `a <= b`, it returns `a - 1`.
   - If `a > b`, it returns `b`.

3. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly implementing the game rules described in the problem.
   - According to the problem, in each round, players at positions `a_1, a_2, ..., a_k` are kicked out, and this process continues until no more players can be kicked out.
   - The function `func_1` only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and does not account for the entire sequence `a` or the rounds of the game.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the example given in the problem with `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`:
     - The correct output should be `2` (players A and B win).
     - However, `func_1(3, 5)` returns `2`, which is coincidentally correct for this specific case but does not generalize to other cases.
   - For `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 6`:
     - The correct output should be `1` (players A, B, and D win).
     - However, `func_1(3, 6)` returns `2`, which is incorrect.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the game rules.
   - It only considers the first element of the sequence `a` and does not handle the rounds or the entire sequence `a`.
