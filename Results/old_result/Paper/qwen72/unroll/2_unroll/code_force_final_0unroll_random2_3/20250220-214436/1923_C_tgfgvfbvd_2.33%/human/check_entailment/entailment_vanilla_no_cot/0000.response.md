Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem based on the given problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix sum of the array `l` and stores it in the list `p`. This allows for efficient calculation of the sum of any subarray `c[l_i, r_i]` using the formula `p[r_i - 1] - p[l_i - 2]` (if `l_i > 1`).

2. **Query Handling**: For each query, the program:
   - Extracts the subarray sum `s` using the prefix sum list `p`.
   - Checks if the subarray length `b - a + 1` is greater than 1 (i.e., the subarray has more than one element).
   - Ensures that the sum `s` of the subarray is at least twice the length of the subarray, which is necessary to construct a valid array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `a`.

3. **Conditions for a Good Subarray**:
   - The subarray must have more than one element (`b - a + 1 > 1`).
   - The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray (`s >= 2 * (b - a + 1)`). This ensures that there is enough "slack" to create a different array `b` where each element is positive and different from the corresponding element in `a`.

4. **Output**: The program prints 'YES' if the subarray meets the conditions, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program efficiently handles the constraints and correctly determines whether each subarray is good or not. Therefore, the program is correct.
