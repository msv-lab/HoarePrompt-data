You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 1
    
    BGECDCBDED
    
    10 2
    
    BGECDCBDED
    
    9 1
    
    BBCDEFFGG

Output

    2
    5
    1

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEF'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case is defined by integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters from 'A' to 'G'. For each test case, the function calculates and prints the number of characters from 'A' to 'F' that are either missing from the string or have a count less than `m`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `s` are no longer relevant, and the program state is reset for the next function call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` contains the character 'G'. The problem description specifies that each round should contain one problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. However, the program only checks for the characters 'A' to 'F' and does not account for 'G'. This means that if the string `s` lacks the character 'G', the program will not correctly compute the number of additional problems needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
The correct output should be `1` because there is no 'A' in the string, and one 'A' is needed to hold one round. However, the program will output `0` because it does not check for the character 'G'.
