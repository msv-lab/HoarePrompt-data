Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers provided by the user, `func_1` is not correctly defined for the problem, and the function should accept parameters `n` and `u_1` where `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree (2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5) and `u_1` is an integer representing the starting node (1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n). Additionally, the function should accept a list of edges, each represented as a tuple of two integers (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, indicating the connections between nodes in the tree.**
