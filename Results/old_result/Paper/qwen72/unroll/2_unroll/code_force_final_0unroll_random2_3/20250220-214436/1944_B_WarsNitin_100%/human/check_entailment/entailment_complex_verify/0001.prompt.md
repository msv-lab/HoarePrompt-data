You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length 2n , consisting of each integer from 1 to n
exactly twice.

You are also given an integer k (1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

You need to find two arrays l and r each of length \mathbf{2k} such that:

  * l is a subset^\dagger of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] 
  * r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] 
  * [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r ; in other words, l_1 \oplus l_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus l_{2k} = r_1 \oplus r_2 \oplus \ldots \oplus r_{2k} 

It can be proved that at least one pair of l and r always exists. If there are
multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

^\dagger A sequence x is a subset of a sequence y if x can be obtained by
deleting several (possibly none or all) elements of y and rearranging the
elements in any order. For example, [3,1,2,1] , [1, 2, 3] , [1, 1] and [3, 2]
are subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3] but [4] and [2, 2] are not subsets of [1, 1, 2, 3]
.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 \le n \le 5
\cdot 10^4 , 1 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor ).

The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} (1 \le a_i \le n
). It is guaranteed that every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^4 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line of output, output 2k integers l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_{2k} .

On the second line of output, output 2k integers r_1, r_2, \ldots r_{2k} .

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

Note

In the first test case, we choose l=[2,1] and r=[2,1] . [2, 1] is a subset of
[a_1, a_2] and [2, 1] is a subset of [a_3, a_4] , and 2 \oplus 1 = 2 \oplus 1
= 3 .

In the second test case, 6 \oplus 4 = 1 \oplus 3 = 2 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `a` and `k`, where `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, containing each integer from 1 to n exactly twice, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.

    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been updated for each test case. Specifically, for each test case, `ans1` and `ans2` will contain the elements from the sorted halves of the list `a` that meet the specified conditions, and these lists will be printed. The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and the final values of `t` and `q` will be the same as the initial values, while `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been reset for each new test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by a list `a` of integers of length 2n (where each integer from 1 to n appears exactly twice) and an integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋). For each test case, it finds two subsets `ans1` and `ans2` of length 2k from the first and second halves of `a`, respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `ans2`. The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `req`, and `l` will have been updated and reset for each new test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and the array `a`.

2. **Array Splitting:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves: `b` (first half) and `c` (second half).

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both halves `b` and `c` are sorted. This ensures that any duplicates are adjacent.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Two lists `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized to store the subsets `l` and `r` respectively.
   - A variable `k` is set to `2 * k` to handle the length of the subsets.
   - A list `l` is initialized to store unique elements from `b` that are not included in `ans1`.

5. **Processing `b`:**
   - The program checks if the first element of `b` is different from the second element. If so, it adds the first element to `l`.
   - It then checks the last element of `b` (if it is not the same as the second last element). If they are the same, it adds the last element twice to `ans1` and decreases `k` by 2.
   - For the remaining elements in `b`, it checks if the current element is the same as the previous one. If so, it adds the element twice to `ans1` and decreases `k` by 2.
   - If the current element is different from the next one, it adds the element to `l`.

6. **Processing `c`:**
   - The program processes `c` similarly to `b` but only checks for duplicates and adds them to `ans2`.

7. **Balancing `ans1` and `ans2`:**
   - If there are any elements left in `l`, it adds them to both `ans1` and `ans2` to ensure the lengths of `ans1` and `ans2` are equal to `2k`.

8. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
  - The program ensures that `ans1` and `ans2` are subsets of the first and second halves of `a`, respectively.
  - It attempts to balance the subsets by adding elements in pairs when possible.
  - The XOR condition is not explicitly checked, but the program's logic ensures that the subsets are balanced in terms of their lengths and elements.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `b` and `c` have duplicates correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `b` and `c` have unique elements by adding them to `l` and then to both `ans1` and `ans2`.

- **Potential Issues:**
  - The program does not explicitly check if the XOR of elements in `ans1` is equal to the XOR of elements in `ans2`. However, the problem guarantees that at least one valid pair of subsets always exists, and the program's logic ensures that the subsets are balanced in terms of their lengths and elements.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to follow the problem's requirements and constraints. It correctly handles the input and output, and the logic for generating the subsets `l` and `r` is sound. Given the problem's guarantee that a valid solution always exists, the program should produce a valid solution for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
