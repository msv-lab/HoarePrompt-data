You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:
def func():
    s = input()
    balance = 0
    details = []
    for (i, char) in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        details.append((balance, -i, char))
    details.sort()
    result = ''.join((char for (_, _, char) in details))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function takes no parameters and operates on a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", where `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It reads the string `s` from user input, processes it to maintain a balance of parentheses, and then prints the reverse of the original string `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the original string `s` remains unchanged, and the printed output is the reversed string of `s`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance of the prefix of the sequence before each character. This is done by iterating through the string `s` and updating the `balance` variable based on whether the character is an opening parenthesis `(` or a closing parenthesis `)`.

2. **Details Collection**: The program collects the balance, position (negated to ensure decreasing order), and character in a list called `details`. This list is structured as tuples `(balance, -i, char)`.

3. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance in increasing order and, in case of ties, by the position in decreasing order. This sorting step is crucial to achieving the balanced shuffle as specified.

4. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input sequence.

The program handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for the balanced shuffle operation is implemented correctly. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
