Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program only explicitly handles the cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any \( n \) outside of these values, it prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. According to the problem description, the program should handle any \( n \) in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \). Therefore, the program is incorrect for any \( n \) greater than 4. For example, if \( n = 5 \), the program will not produce the correct checkerboard pattern. The annotations confirm that the function does not handle cases for \( n > 4 \), and the behavior for such cases is to print "No esta en el rango".

Final: **False**
