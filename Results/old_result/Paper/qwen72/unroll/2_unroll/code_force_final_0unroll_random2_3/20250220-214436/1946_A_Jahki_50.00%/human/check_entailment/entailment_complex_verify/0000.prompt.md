You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is intended to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: The loop will process each test case and print the number of operations required to increment the median value of the array until it is no longer equal to the original median. If `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000, the loop will print 1 and 16668 and then break, stopping further processing of test cases. The variables `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, and `new_median` will be updated within the loop for each test case, but their final values will depend on the specific input for the last test case processed. The variable `num` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. If `n` is greater than 10000, the function prints 1 and 16668 and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it calculates the number of operations required to increment the median value of the array `a` until it is no longer equal to the original median, and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The variables used within the function are updated for each test case, but their final values depend on the specific input of the last test case processed. The variable `num` (the total number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Input Size**: The program checks if `num2 > 10000` and prints a fixed value of 1 and 16668, which is not a valid solution for the problem. The problem description specifies that the length of the array `n` can be up to \(10^5\), and the program should handle all valid input sizes correctly.

2. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The program uses a while loop to increment the median value until it is greater than the current median. However, this approach is inefficient and incorrect. The median should be increased by the smallest number of operations, and the program does not consider the optimal way to do this.

3. **Incorrect Break Statement**: The break statement inside the if condition for `num2 > 10000` will terminate the loop prematurely, causing the program to skip the remaining test cases.

4. **Handling Even-Length Arrays**: The program does not correctly handle even-length arrays. For even-length arrays, the median is the middle element, but the program does not account for the need to increase both middle elements to ensure the median increases.

5. **Efficiency Issues**: The program sorts the array inside the while loop, which is inefficient and unnecessary. The median can be found and updated more efficiently.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  1 2 3 4
  ```
- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  1
  16668
  ```
  The program prints an additional value of 16668, which is not part of the expected output. This is due to the incorrect handling of the input size and the break statement.
