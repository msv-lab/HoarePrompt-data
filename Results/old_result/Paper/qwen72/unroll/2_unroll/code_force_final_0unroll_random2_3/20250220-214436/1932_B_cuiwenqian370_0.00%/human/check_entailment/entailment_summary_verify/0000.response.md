Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem described. The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs, and ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. However, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to solve a different problem involving a path with '@' and '*' characters, which is not related to the periodic occurrence of signs.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to process a string `path` and calculate a dynamic programming array `dp` based on the characters in the string.
   - It initializes `dp` with zeros and sets the first element to 1 if the first character of `path` is '@', or to negative infinity if it is '*'.
   - It then iterates through the string, updating the `dp` array based on the characters and the values of the previous two elements.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array that is not negative infinity.
   - This function is not related to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign based on periodicities.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `path`.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the `path` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results.
   - The function is correctly structured to handle multiple test cases, but it is solving the wrong problem.

### Correct Solution:
To solve the given problem, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, starting from the first sign and ensuring that each subsequent sign occurs strictly after the previous one. Here is a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)

def find_apocalypse_year(periods):
    year = periods[0]
    for i in range(1, len(periods)):
        year = lcm(year, periods[i])
    return year

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        periods = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        results.append(find_apocalypse_year(periods))
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
- **LCM Calculation**: The `lcm` function calculates the least common multiple of two numbers.
- **Finding the Year**: The `find_apocalypse_year` function iterates through the list of periodicities, updating the `year` to be the LCM of the current `year` and the next periodicity. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous one.
- **Main Function**: The `main` function reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**. The provided program is incorrect and does not solve the given problem.
