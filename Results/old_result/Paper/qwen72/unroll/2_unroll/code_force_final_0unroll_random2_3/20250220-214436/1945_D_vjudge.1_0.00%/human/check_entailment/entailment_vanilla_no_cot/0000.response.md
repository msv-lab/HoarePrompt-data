Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. Each test case reads the values of `n` and `m`, followed by the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Reversing Lists**: The lists `a` and `b` are reversed. This is a clever approach because it allows the program to consider the positions from the end of the queue to the front, which simplifies the logic for calculating the minimum cost.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `soma_b` to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative cost of bribing people in the positions between `j` and `i`.
   - The program also initializes `pref` to 0, which keeps track of the total cost incurred so far.
   - The first loop iterates over the positions from `n` to `n - k + 1` (inclusive). For each position, it checks if the cost of bribing the person at position `i` (i.e., `a[i]`) is less than the cost of bribing the person at position `j` (i.e., `b[i]`). If so, it adds the cost `a[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b` to 0. Otherwise, it adds `b[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - The second loop iterates over the positions from `n - k` to 1 (inclusive). For each position, it calculates the total cost of moving to this position and updates the minimum cost (`resultado`).

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

The logic of the program is sound and follows the problem's constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
