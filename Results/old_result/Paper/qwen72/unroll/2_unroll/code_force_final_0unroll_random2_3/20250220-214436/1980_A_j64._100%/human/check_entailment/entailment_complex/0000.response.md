### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `a` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Frequencies**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of length 7 to store the frequency of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the character's position in the alphabet. This is done using `ord(char) - ord('A')`, which correctly maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, and so on.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The function then iterates over the `count` list to determine how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` problems per round. If the count of a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it calculates the difference and adds it to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**: The function returns the total number of additional problems needed. This is the correct output for the problem, as it ensures that each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') appears at least `m` times in the string `a`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `m` is 1 and all difficulty levels are present in the string `a`, it correctly returns 0. If `m` is greater than the number of problems available for any difficulty level, it correctly calculates the additional problems needed.

6. **Constraints**: The program adheres to the constraints provided in the problem description. It can handle up to 1000 test cases, with `n` up to 50 and `m` up to 5.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
