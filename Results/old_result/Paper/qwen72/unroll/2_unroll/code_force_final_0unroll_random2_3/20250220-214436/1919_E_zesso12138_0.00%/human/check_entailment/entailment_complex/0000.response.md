Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function is intended to compute the number of possible arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - The `dp` array is used to keep track of the number of ways to achieve a certain prefix sum at each step.
   - The `offset` is used to handle negative indices in the `dp` array.
   - The loop iterates over each element of `p` and updates the `dp` array based on the possible transitions (adding 1 or -1).
   - However, there is a critical issue in the function: the variable `final_sum` is not correctly defined. The correct definition should be `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` instead of `final_sum = p[-1] + offset` (which is correct but not used correctly in the return statement).
   - The return statement should be `return dp[p[-1] + offset]` to return the correct value from the `dp` array.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and the size `n` and prefix sums `p` for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the issue in `func_1` where `final_sum` is not used correctly, the program will raise a `NameError` when it tries to return `dp[final_sum]` because `final_sum` is not defined. This means the program will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
