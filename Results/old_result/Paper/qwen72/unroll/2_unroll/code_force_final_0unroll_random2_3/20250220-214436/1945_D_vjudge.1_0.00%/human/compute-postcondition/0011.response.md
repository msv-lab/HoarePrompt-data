Output State: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `lista_A` and `lista_B` remain unchanged, `soma_b` is the sum of elements in `lista_B` from index `k` to `n-1`, `pref` is the sum of `soma_b` and the elements in `lista_A` from index `0` to `n-k-1` that are less than the corresponding elements in `lista_B`, `resultado` is the minimum value of `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]` for `i` in the range from `n-k` to `n-1`.**
