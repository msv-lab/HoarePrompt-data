Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` reads input values for `n` and `t`, where `n` is the number of nodes in a tree and `t` is an integer. It then reads `n-1` edges of the tree and constructs a deque `tree` based on these edges. The function reads an additional input `start`, which is the starting node. It determines the index of `start` in the `tree` and calculates two potential moves based on the index and the value of `t`. If either of these moves is an odd number, the function prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `n` and `t` remain unchanged, `tree` contains the nodes appended based on the conditions in the loop, `empty` is False if any elements were appended to `tree`, otherwise it remains True, `start` is the input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree` if `start` is in `tree`, otherwise a `ValueError` is raised, and `moves` is a list containing two elements: `min(t, idx)` and `min(t, n - idx - 1)`.
