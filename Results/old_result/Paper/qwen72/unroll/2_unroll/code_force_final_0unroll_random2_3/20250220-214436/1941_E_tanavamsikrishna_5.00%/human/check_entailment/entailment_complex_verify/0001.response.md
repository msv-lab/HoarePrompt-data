### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves a grid representing a river with `n` rows and `m` columns.
   - Each cell `(i, j)` has a depth `a_{i, j}`.
   - Rudolf needs to build `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - The cost of installing a support in cell `(i, j)` is `a_{i, j} + 1`.
   - Supports must be installed in the first and last columns of the chosen row.
   - The distance between any pair of adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(row: List[int], d: int)`**
   - This function calculates the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It initializes the cost for the first `d-1` cells by adding 1 to each cell's depth.
   - For the remaining cells, it calculates the cost by adding 1 to the cell's depth and the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` cells.
   - Finally, it returns the cost of the last cell in the row.

   **Annotation Analysis:**
   - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements by 1, which is correct because the first `d-1` supports must be installed.
   - The second loop updates each element from `d-1` to the end of the row by adding 1 to the cell's depth and the minimum cost of the previous `d+1` elements. This ensures that the distance constraint `d` is respected.
   - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which is the total cost of installing supports for the entire row.

   **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum cost for a single row while respecting the constraints.

3. **Function 2: `func_2()`**
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, `m`, the number of bridges `k`, and the maximum distance `d`.
   - It reads the grid of depths for `n` rows.
   - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then calculates the total cost for each possible set of `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum of these total costs.

   **Annotation Analysis:**
   - The input is read correctly and converted to integers.
   - The grid is read row by row and stored in a list of lists.
   - The `costs` list is populated by calling `func_1` for each row, which is correct.
   - The `total_costs` list is populated by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows, which is correct.
   - The function prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which is the correct output for the test case.

   **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the input, processes each row using `func_1`, and finds the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, such as the number of rows and columns, the number of bridges, and the maximum distance.
   - The program ensures that supports are installed in the first and last columns of each row.
   - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for each row and the total cost for `k` consecutive rows.

5. **Algorithmic Correctness:**
   - The algorithm used in `func_1` is a dynamic programming approach that ensures the minimum cost for installing supports while respecting the distance constraint `d`.
   - The algorithm in `func_2` correctly iterates over all possible sets of `k` consecutive rows and finds the minimum total cost.

### Final Evaluation:
The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles the input and output correctly, respects the constraints, and uses an appropriate dynamic programming approach to minimize the total cost of installing supports.

**Final: True**
