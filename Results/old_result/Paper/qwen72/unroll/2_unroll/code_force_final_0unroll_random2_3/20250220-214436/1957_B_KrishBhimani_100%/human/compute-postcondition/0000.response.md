The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted. The parameters `n` and `k` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is not used and can be any value**
