### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.

2. **Counting Card Frequencies**:
   - The function initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each card value in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each card value.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points**:
   - The function initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It iterates through the `cnt` list and for each card value `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`.
   - The logic `max(0, x - 1)` ensures that if a card value appears more than once in your hand, you can get one point for the second occurrence (since the first occurrence will not score a point).

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the value of `ans` for each test case, which represents the maximum number of points you can get.

### Analysis:
- **Optimal Play**:
  - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. However, the problem's constraints and the nature of the game imply that the maximum points you can get are determined by the number of card values that appear more than once in your hand.
  - If a card value appears more than once in your hand, you can score a point for the second occurrence, regardless of Nene's optimal play.

- **Correctness**:
  - The function correctly counts the number of card values that appear more than once in your hand.
  - The function correctly calculates the maximum points you can get by summing `max(0, x - 1)` for each card value `x` in your hand.
  - The function handles multiple test cases and prints the correct output for each.
