Based on the initial state provided:

- The loop will print a series of queries in the format `? l i*v` for each valid `l` and `i*v` combination.
- If the conditions are met, it will print a final statement `! i*v` and return.
- The variables `n`, `k`, and `v` will remain unchanged.
- The variable `i` will be the last value in the range `1` to `n // k` that was processed.
- The variable `cnt` will be `0`.
- The variable `l` will be `n + 1`.

Given the `print` statement:
```
print('! -1', flush=True)
```

The `print` statement is not dependent on any of the variables or conditions described in the initial state. It simply prints the string `! -1` and flushes the output buffer.

Output: **! -1**
