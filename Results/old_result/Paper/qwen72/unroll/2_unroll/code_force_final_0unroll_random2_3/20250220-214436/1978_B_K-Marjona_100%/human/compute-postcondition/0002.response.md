The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. The function's output is not specified, but it is expected to return some result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with three integer parameters `n`, `a`, and `b` (where `1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9`), and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.**
