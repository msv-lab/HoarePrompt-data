You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length m (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets, k and n are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 26.

    r = len(s1) // k
    return len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2
    #The program returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the length of `s1` is greater than or equal to `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, and the string `s2` which contains the last character of `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and two integers `k` and `n`. It processes `s` to create a string `s1` that contains each of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets from `s` at most once, and a string `s2` that consists of the last character from `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end (where `r` is the quotient of the length of `s1` divided by `k`), and the string `s2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. 

### Issue 1: Incorrect Subsequence Check
The function `func_1` attempts to build a string `s1` by removing characters from the set `alphabet` as they are encountered in `s`. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked. For example, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the third test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `m = 10`
- `s = "aabbccabab"`

The program should check if all possible strings of length 3 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (i.e., "aaa", "aab", "aac", "aba", "abb", "abc", "aca", "acb", "acc", "baa", "bab", "bac", "bba", "bbb", "bbc", "bca", "bcb", "bcc", "caa", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbb", "cbc", "cca", "ccb", "ccc") occur as a subsequence in `s`.

However, the function `func_1` only builds a string `s1` by removing characters from the set `alphabet` and does not check all possible subsequences. This means it may incorrectly return `True` even if some subsequences are missing.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence
The program constructs a missing subsequence by appending the same character multiple times. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid subsequence that is missing from `s`. For example, if the string `s` is "aabbccabab" and the program is supposed to find a missing subsequence of length 3 using the first 3 alphabets, it might incorrectly construct "ccc" even if "ccc" is not a valid missing subsequence.

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

The program should output:
```
NO
ccc
```

However, the program might output:
```
NO
bbb
```

This is incorrect because "bbb" is a valid subsequence in "aabbccabab".

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case, and it fails to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
