You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.

    #State: For each test case, `t` is updated based on the input values `a` and `b` such that it is the minimum number of 15-minute intervals required to satisfy the condition `t * 15 >= a + b * 4`. The value of `t` for each test case is printed. The initial value of `t` and the input values `a` and `b` for each test case are not retained after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. The function calculates the minimum number of 15-minute intervals (`t`) required such that `t * 15 >= a + b * 4` and prints this value for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `t` for each test case are not retained.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program has a logical error in how it calculates the number of screens needed. Specifically, the calculation of `t1` and the subsequent logic for determining `t` is incorrect. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. The program first calculates `t` as the number of 2x2 icons, rounded up to the nearest whole number of screens. This is correct.
2. It then calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`, which is supposed to represent the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. However, this calculation is flawed because:
   - Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - Each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - The correct calculation for the remaining space on the screens should be `t * 15 - b * 4`.

3. The program then checks if `t1` (the remaining space) is greater than or equal to `a` (the number of 1x1 icons). If it is, it sets `t` to the same value. This is correct.
4. If `t1` is less than `a`, it calculates `t2` as `a - t1`, which is the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed. The program then adds the number of additional screens needed for these icons, but the logic here is also flawed:
   - The program uses `if t2 % 15 == 0: t = t + t2 // 15` to add the exact number of screens needed if `t2` is a multiple of 15.
   - However, if `t2` is not a multiple of 15, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens. This is incorrect because it may overestimate the number of screens needed.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
12 4
```
- `a = 12` (1x1 icons)
- `b = 4` (2x2 icons)

The program calculates:
- `t = 4 // 2 + 1 = 3` (since 4 2x2 icons need 3 screens)
- `t1 = 3 * 15 - 4 * 4 = 45 - 16 = 29` (remaining space after placing 2x2 icons)
- `t1 >= a` (29 >= 12) is true, so it sets `t = 3`.

However, the correct answer should be 2 screens:
- 4 2x2 icons can fit in 2 screens (8 cells used, 22 cells remaining).
- 12 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining 22 cells.

Thus, the program fails to correctly determine the minimum number of screens needed for this case.
