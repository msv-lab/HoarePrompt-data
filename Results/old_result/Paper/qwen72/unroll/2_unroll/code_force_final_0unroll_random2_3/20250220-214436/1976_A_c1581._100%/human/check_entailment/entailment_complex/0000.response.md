Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the length of the password and the password itself.

2. **Character Separation**: The function `func_1` separates the characters of the password into two lists: `digits` and `letters`. This is done correctly by checking if each character is a digit or a letter.

3. **Sorting**: Both `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted. This ensures that the digits and letters are in non-decreasing order, which is one of the conditions for a strong password.

4. **Digit After Letter Check**: The program checks if any digit comes after a letter. This is done by comparing the last digit (if any) with each letter in the `letters` list. If a digit is found to be greater than any letter, the function returns `False`.

5. **Final Check**: The program constructs a new string `sortedPassword` by concatenating the sorted `digits` and `letters` lists. It then compares this new string with the original password. If they are the same, the password is strong and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

However, there is a logical issue in the digit after letter check:
- The loop that checks if any digit is greater than any letter should not be inside the loop that checks the order of digits. It should be a separate check to ensure that no digit appears after a letter in the original password.

Additionally, the function can be simplified to avoid unnecessary checks and loops. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
    
    # Check if digits and letters are sorted
    if digits != sorted(digits) or letters != sorted(letters):
        return False
    
    # Check if any digit comes after a letter
    if letters and digits and letters[-1] < digits[0]:
        return False
    
    return True
```

Given the original function, the issue with the digit after letter check means that the function might return `False` prematurely, leading to incorrect results for some valid passwords.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
