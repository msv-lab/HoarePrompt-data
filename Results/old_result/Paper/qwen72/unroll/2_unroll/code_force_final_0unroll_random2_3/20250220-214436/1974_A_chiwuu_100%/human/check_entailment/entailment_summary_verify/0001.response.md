### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Screen Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `t` to `b`, which is the number of 2x2 icons. This is because each 2x2 icon requires a significant amount of space, and we need to account for them first.
   - The program then checks if `t` (the number of 2x2 icons) is even or odd. If `t` is even, it divides `t` by 2. If `t` is odd, it divides `t` by 2 and adds 1. This step is intended to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons, assuming each screen can hold up to 2 such icons.
   - However, the function summary incorrectly states that the calculation is for 15-minute intervals. The correct interpretation is that `t` is the number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons, with each screen holding up to 2 2x2 icons.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons as `b * 4`.
   - It then calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This assumes each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).
   - This calculation is correct, as it correctly accounts for the space used by 2x2 icons and the total available space on the screens.

4. **Placing 1x1 Icons**:
   - If the remaining space `t1` is greater than or equal to the number of 1x1 icons `a`, then the current number of screens `t` is sufficient.
   - If the remaining space `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed to place the remaining 1x1 icons. It does this by computing `t2 = a - t1` and then determining how many more screens are needed to fit `t2` 1x1 icons. If `t2` is exactly divisible by 15, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to account for the partial screen.
   - This logic is correct and ensures that any remaining 1x1 icons are placed on the minimum number of additional screens.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.
   - The output is correct for the given test cases and edge cases.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Handling 2x2 Icons**:
  - The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons. Each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, so `t` is calculated as `b // 2 + (b % 2)`.
  - This ensures that if `b` is odd, an extra screen is added to accommodate the last 2x2 icon.

- **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
  - The program correctly calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
  - It then determines if the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons. If not, it calculates the additional screens needed.
  - The logic for adding additional screens for 1x1 icons is also correct, ensuring that any remaining icons are placed on the minimum number of additional screens.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `a` and `b` are both zero. In this case, the number of screens required should be 0, which the program correctly outputs.
  - The program also correctly handles cases where `a` is large and `b` is zero, by calculating the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the provided problem description and the logic used. It handles all edge cases and general cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
