Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `c`, and `d`, and the list `l` of `n * n` integers.

2. **Finding the Minimum Value**:
   - The program finds the minimum value `a` in the list `l`. This is correct because the minimum value in the list should correspond to `a_{1,1}` in the progressive square, which is the smallest element in the matrix.

3. **Generating the Progressive Square**:
   - The program generates a new list `li` by calculating each element as `a + k * c + d * h` for `0 <= k, h < n`. This is the correct formula for constructing the progressive square based on the given rules.

4. **Sorting and Comparison**:
   - Both the original list `l` and the generated list `li` are sorted.
   - The program then compares the sorted lists. If they match, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.
   - This comparison is correct because the elements of the progressive square, when sorted, should match the sorted elements of the input list `l`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is either 'yes' or 'no'.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining if the elements in the list `l` can form a progressive square for the given `n`, `c`, and `d`.

Correctness: **True**
