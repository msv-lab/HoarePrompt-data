The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500. `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6. `l` is a list of `n^2` integers, where each integer `l[i]` satisfies 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n^2. The function returns 'yes' in Case_1 and 'no' in Case_2.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. It returns 'yes' in one case and 'no' in another case.**
