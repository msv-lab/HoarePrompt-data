### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input.

2. **Determine the Optimal `k`:**
   - The variable `k` is set to `min(n, b - a)`. This is correct because:
     - `k` should not exceed `n` (the number of buns).
     - `k` should not exceed `b - a` to ensure the modified price is always greater than or equal to the usual price `a`.

3. **Calculate the Profit:**
   - If `b <= a`, the function correctly prints `a * n` because the modified price is not beneficial, and Bob should sell all buns at the usual price.
   - If `b > a`, the function calculates the profit as follows:
     - **Modified Price Profit:** `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`
       - This formula is derived from the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the common difference is `-1`.
       - The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series is given by `k/2 * (2b - (k - 1))`, which simplifies to `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
     - **Usual Price Profit:** `(n - k) * a`
       - This is the profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a`.

4. **Output the Result:**
   - The function correctly prints the total profit for each test case.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 4 5`
  - `k = min(4, 5 - 4) = 1`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is:
    - Modified price profit: `5 * 1 - 1 * (1 - 1) // 2 = 5`
    - Usual price profit: `(4 - 1) * 4 = 12`
    - Total profit: `5 + 12 = 17`
  - Output: `17` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `5 5 9`
  - `k = min(5, 9 - 5) = 4`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is:
    - Modified price profit: `9 * 4 - 4 * (4 - 1) // 2 = 36 - 6 = 30`
    - Usual price profit: `(5 - 4) * 5 = 5`
    - Total profit: `30 + 5 = 35`
  - Output: `35` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `10 10 5`
  - `k = min(10, 5 - 10) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is:
    - Usual price profit: `10 * 10 = 100`
  - Output: `100` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `5 5 11`
  - `k = min(5, 11 - 5) = 5`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is:
    - Modified price profit: `11 * 5 - 5 * (5 - 1) // 2 = 55 - 10 = 45`
  - Output: `45` (Correct)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1000000000 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is:
    - Usual price profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
  - `k = min(1000000000, 1 - 1000000000) = 0`
  - Since `b <= a`, the profit is:
    - Usual price profit: `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`
  - Output: `1000000000000000000` (Correct)

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `1000 1 1000`
  - `k = min(1000, 1000 - 1) = 999`
  - Since `b > a`, the profit is:
    - Modified price profit: `1000 * 999 - 999 * (999 - 1) // 2 = 999000 - 498501 = 499499`
    - Usual price profit: `(1000 - 999) * 1 = 1`
    - Total profit: `499499 + 1 = 500500`
  - Output: `500500` (Correct)
