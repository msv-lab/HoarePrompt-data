The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively. It also reads `m` tuples, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The function calculates a value based on these inputs and prints the result of a specific formula for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` results have been printed, each corresponding to a test case.
