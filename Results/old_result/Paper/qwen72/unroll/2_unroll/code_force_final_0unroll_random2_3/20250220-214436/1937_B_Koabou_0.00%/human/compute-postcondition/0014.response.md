Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads a single integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the input. It then checks for the first position where the second string has a '0' and the first string has a '1' immediately after it. If such a position is found, it creates a new string `s` by concatenating the first part of the first string up to that position with the rest of the second string. If no such position is found, `s` is the concatenation of the first string and the last character of the second string. The function also calculates a value `t` based on the longest prefix of the first string that matches the prefix of `s`. Finally, it prints the string `s` and the value `t`. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `grid`. **
