You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: For each test case, the loop calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by using the available coins. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not directly modified by the loop, but the loop processes each test case and prints the result. After all iterations of the loop, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain as they were initially, but the loop has printed the results for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` representing the initial number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by using the available coins. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain as they were initially, but the results for each test case have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given `n` types of cards, and for each type `i`, we have `a_i` cards.
   - We can buy up to `k` additional cards of any type.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that are permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Approach:**
   - To form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`, each number from 1 to `n` must appear exactly once in the subarray.
   - The key is to ensure that the minimum number of any type of card is as close to `n` as possible, because this will allow us to form more permutations.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - **Sort the Array:** The array `a` is sorted to facilitate the process of balancing the counts of cards.
   - **Balance the Counts:** We iterate through the sorted array and try to balance the counts of the cards by using the available `k` coins.
   - **Calculate the Result:**
     - If the difference between the counts of the current card and the next card is greater than the available `k` coins, we stop and calculate the result.
     - Otherwise, we continue to balance the counts by using the coins.

4. **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `r` is initialized to the smallest count of cards (`a[0]`).
     - `rem` is the remainder of the coins after the last balancing step.
     - `y` is the number of cards that are already balanced and do not need further adjustment.
   - **Balancing Loop:**
     - For each card type from 1 to `n-1`, we check if the difference between the current count and the next count exceeds the available `k` coins.
     - If it does, we calculate the new count `r` and the remainder `rem`, and break out of the loop.
     - If it doesn't, we use the coins to balance the counts and update `k`.
   - **Final Calculation:**
     - If `k` is not zero after the loop, we use the remaining coins to increase the count of the last card type.
     - The final score is calculated as `(r - 1) * n + 1 + rem + y`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is zero after the loop.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is non-zero and can be used to further increase the count of the last card type.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
   - The balancing loop takes \(O(n)\) time.
   - The overall complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by balancing the counts of cards and using the available coins. The steps and calculations are logically sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
