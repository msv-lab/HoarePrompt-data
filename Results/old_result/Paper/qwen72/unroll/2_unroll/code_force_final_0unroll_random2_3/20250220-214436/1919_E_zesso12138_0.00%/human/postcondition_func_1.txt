The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of data, and applies a function `func_1` to each set. It then prints the results of `func_1` for each set. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` holds the number of test cases, `n` holds the size of the last processed list, `p` holds the last processed list of integers, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is the total number of elements processed from `data`, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.
