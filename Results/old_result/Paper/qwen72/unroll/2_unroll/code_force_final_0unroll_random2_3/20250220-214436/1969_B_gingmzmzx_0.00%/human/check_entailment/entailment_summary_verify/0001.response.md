### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases, `n`, and processes each test case by reading a binary string `s` and converting it to a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The variable `zeroes` is correctly initialized to count the number of zeros in the string `s`.

3. **Initialization of Counters**:
   - The list `cnt` is correctly initialized to keep track of the number of zeros and ones encountered so far.
   - The variable `ans` is correctly initialized to zero, which will store the minimum total cost to sort the string.

4. **Iterating Through the String**:
   - The function iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character, it updates the count of the current character in `cnt`.
   - If the character is `0`:
     - It increments `ans` by 1 if there are any ones (`cnt[1] > 0`), indicating that a zero is following a one, which requires a shift to move the zero to the left.
   - If the character is `1`:
     - It increments `ans` by the number of remaining zeros (`zeroes - cnt[0]`), indicating the cost to move all remaining zeros to the left of the current one.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing the string, the function prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
  - The algorithm correctly identifies the cost of making the string sorted by counting the number of zeros that need to be moved to the left of each one.
  - The cost is calculated by summing the lengths of the substrings that need to be cyclically shifted to move zeros to the left of ones.
  - The logic ensures that the minimum number of shifts is performed by only considering the necessary moves.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000" or "1111"), the algorithm correctly outputs `0` because no shifts are needed.
  - If the string has a mix of zeros and ones, the algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the string.

- **Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \(O(|s|)\) for each test case, where \(|s|\) is the length of the string.
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the counters and the answer variable.

### Verification with Function Summary:

- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.
- It confirms that the function reads the number of test cases, processes each binary string, and calculates the minimum total cost to sort the string.
- The summary also mentions that the function prints the results and does not return any value, which aligns with the original code.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum total cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. It handles all edge cases and efficiently calculates the cost. The function summary supports the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
