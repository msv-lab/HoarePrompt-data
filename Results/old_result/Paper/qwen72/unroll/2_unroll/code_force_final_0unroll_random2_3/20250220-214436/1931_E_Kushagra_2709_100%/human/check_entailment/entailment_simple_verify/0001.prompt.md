You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Anna and Sasha, who take turns manipulating a list of integers.
   - Anna reverses the digits of a single integer on her turn.
   - Sasha concatenates two integers and inserts the result back into the list on his turn.
   - The game ends when there is only one integer left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final integer is not less than \(10^m\), otherwise Anna wins.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The length of the final integer is crucial. If the final integer has at least \(m + 1\) digits, Sasha wins.
   - Anna's move (reversing digits) does not change the number of digits in the integer.
   - Sasha's move (concatenating two integers) increases the total number of digits in the list by the number of digits in the two integers combined, minus the number of digits in the resulting concatenated integer.

3. **Function `zerocnts`:**
   - This function counts the number of trailing zeros in a given integer.
   - It is used to determine how many digits can be removed from the total count when Sasha concatenates two integers.
   - The function is correct because it iterates from the end of the string representation of the number and counts zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of digits in the list of integers.
   - It then sorts the list of trailing zero counts in descending order.
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, subtracting the number of trailing zeros from the total digit count.
   - The idea is that Sasha can always choose the two integers with the most trailing zeros to concatenate, thus minimizing the increase in the total number of digits.
   - Finally, it checks if the total number of digits is greater than or equal to \(m + 1\). If so, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The function `zerocnts` correctly counts trailing zeros.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the total number of digits in the list.
   - The sorting and subtraction logic in `func_1` ensures that Sasha's optimal strategy is considered.
   - The final check `tot >= m + 1` correctly determines the winner based on the total number of digits.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct in determining the winner of the game based on the optimal play of both players.
