You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = input()
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
    for i in results:
        print(i)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then evaluates whether `n` is odd and if the count of "U" in `s` is greater than the count of "D". If both conditions are met, it appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in the results list. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `arr` representing the state of the coins.

2. **Even Number of Coins:**
   - The program checks if `n` is even. If `n` is even, it appends 'no' to the results list. This is correct because if the number of coins is even, Bob will always have a move after Alice, and Alice will eventually be the one who is forced to make the last move when no facing-up coins are left. Therefore, Alice will lose if `n` is even.

3. **Odd Number of Coins:**
   - If `n` is odd, the program counts the number of 'U' (facing-up) and 'D' (facing-down) coins.
   - If the number of 'U' coins is greater than the number of 'D' coins, it appends 'yes' to the results list. This is incorrect. The number of 'U' coins being greater than the number of 'D' coins does not necessarily mean Alice will win. The game's outcome depends on the positions of the 'U' coins and the optimal strategy of both players.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy for this game is more complex than just counting the number of 'U' and 'D' coins. The key is to understand that the game can be reduced to a simpler form where the parity (odd or even) of the number of 'U' coins and their positions play a crucial role.
   - For example, if there are an odd number of 'U' coins and they are positioned in such a way that Alice can always force Bob into a losing position, Alice will win. However, the program does not account for the positions of the 'U' coins.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not consider the positions of the 'U' coins and the optimal strategy for the game. The condition `arr.count('U') > arr.count('D')` is not sufficient to determine the winner when `n` is odd.

### Correctness:
**False**
