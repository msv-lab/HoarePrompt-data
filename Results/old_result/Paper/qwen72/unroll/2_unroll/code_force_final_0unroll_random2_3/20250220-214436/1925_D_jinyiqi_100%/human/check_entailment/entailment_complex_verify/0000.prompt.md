You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n (the number of children), m (the number of pairs of friends), and k (the number of excursions). Each of these parameters is an integer, with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5. Additionally, the function should take a list of m tuples, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value, with constraints 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, then reads `m` tuples of integers `a`, `b`, and `f` from the input. After processing these inputs, it calculates and prints the result of the formula `(2 * k * n * (n - 1) // 2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // (2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, representing the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively. It also reads `m` tuples, each containing three integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`, representing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The function calculates a value based on these inputs and prints the result of a specific formula for each test case. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` results have been printed, each corresponding to a test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the expected value calculation for the friendship values. Specifically, the formula used to calculate the expected value is incorrect. The program calculates:

\[ p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2 \]

However, the correct formula should be:

\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \cdot \sum f + \binom{k}{2} \cdot m}{\binom{n}{2}} \]

Where:
- \(\sum f\) is the sum of the initial friendship values.
- \(\binom{k}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 excursions out of \(k\), which is \(\frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2}\).
- \(\binom{n}{2}\) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of \(n\), which is \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).

The program's formula does not correctly account for the expected increase in friendship values due to the excursions. For example, consider the case where \(n = 3\), \(m = 1\), and \(k = 2\), with the initial friendship value of the only pair being 1. The correct expected value should be:

\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot 1 + \binom{2}{2} \cdot 1}{\binom{3}{2}} = \frac{2 + 1}{3} = 1 \]

But the program calculates:

\[ p = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 12 + 2 = 14 \]
\[ q = 2 \cdot 3^2 = 18 \]

\[ \text{Expected Value} = \frac{14}{18} = \frac{7}{9} \]

This is incorrect, and the program does not handle this case correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
