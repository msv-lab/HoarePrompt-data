Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of a grid, followed by `n` strings, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1'). The function prints 'TRIANGLE' if any row in the grid contains exactly one '1', and 'SQUARE' if any row contains more than one '1'. If no row contains a '1', it prints 'SQUARE'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the variables `a` and `b` are reset for each test case. **
