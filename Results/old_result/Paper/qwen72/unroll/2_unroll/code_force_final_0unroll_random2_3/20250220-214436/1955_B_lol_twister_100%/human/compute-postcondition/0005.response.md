Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, `l` is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= l[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < n^2, `a` is the minimum value in the list `l`, `li` is a sorted list of n^2 integers where each element is calculated as `a + k * c + d * h` for 0 <= k, h < n.**
