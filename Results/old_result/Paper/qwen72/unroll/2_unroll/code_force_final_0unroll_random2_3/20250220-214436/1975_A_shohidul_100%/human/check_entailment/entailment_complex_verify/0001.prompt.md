You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration based on the conditions described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads input values for `t`, `n`, and `a` from the user. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it checks if the list `a` of `n` integers is either non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element. If the list meets either of these conditions, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` are not retained as they are re-assigned within each iteration of the loop.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The program first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.

4. **Checking the Split and Swap Condition:**
   - Once it finds the first out-of-order element, it splits the array into two parts: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - All elements in the suffix `a[i:]` should be less than or equal to the first element of the prefix `a[0]`.
     - The suffix `a[i:]` should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Split and Swap:**
  - The program only checks the first out-of-order element and its immediate suffix. However, the problem requires checking if there is any valid split that can make the array sorted.
  - The program should continue checking all possible splits, not just the first one.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, the program should iterate through all possible splits and check if any of them can make the array sorted.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Check all possible splits
        found = False
        for i in range(1, n):
            new = a[i:] + a[:i]
            if all(new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, n)):
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
  - The program first checks if the array is already sorted using the `all` function.
  - If the array is sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

- **Checking All Possible Splits:**
  - The program iterates through all possible split points `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
  - For each split point, it creates a new array `new` by concatenating the suffix `a[i:]` and the prefix `a[:i]`.
  - It then checks if the new array `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - If any split results in a sorted array, it sets `found` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
  - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `found` is `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it only checks the first out-of-order element and its immediate suffix, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by any valid split.
- The corrected program is **correct** as it checks all possible splits and ensures that the array can be sorted by any valid operation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
