### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program uses `func_1()` to read the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the prices for Alice (`prices`) and the prices for Bob (`bonuses`) using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The prices for Alice are negated and stored in `neg_prices` to facilitate the use of a min-heap as a max-heap.
   - The prices and bonuses are combined into a list of tuples `combined` and sorted by the bonus (Bob's price).

3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap `heap` is initialized to store the `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - The remaining items are stored in `remaining_items`.

4. **Initial Profit Calculation**:
   - The initial profit is calculated by summing the bonuses of the items in the heap and adding the combined profit of the remaining items using `func_3()`.

5. **Optimal Profit Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap.
   - For each item, if the combined profit (`item[0] + item[1]`) is non-negative, it is added to the current profit.
   - If the combined profit is negative, it is subtracted from the current profit.
   - The item is then pushed into the heap, and the smallest item in the heap is popped and its profit is subtracted from the current profit.
   - The maximum profit is updated if the current profit is greater than the maximum profit.

6. **Output**:
   - The maximum profit for each test case is printed.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `func_1()` and `func_2()`**:
  - These functions are used to read input and are assumed to be correct based on the problem description.

- **Correctness of `func_3()`**:
  - This function calculates the total profit from the secondary heap and the primary items.
  - It correctly sums the combined profits of the primary items that are non-negative and adds them to the total profit from the secondary heap.

- **Correctness of `func_4()`**:
  - The function correctly initializes the heap with the `k` items that Bob will take for free.
  - It correctly calculates the initial profit by summing the bonuses of the items in the heap and the combined profits of the remaining items.
  - The function then iterates through the remaining items, updating the current profit and the heap to ensure that Bob takes the `k` items with the highest bonuses for free.
  - The maximum profit is correctly updated and printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's profit when both Alice and Bob act optimally. The use of a heap to manage the `k` items Bob takes for free and the iterative update of the current profit are appropriate for the problem.

**Correctness: True**
