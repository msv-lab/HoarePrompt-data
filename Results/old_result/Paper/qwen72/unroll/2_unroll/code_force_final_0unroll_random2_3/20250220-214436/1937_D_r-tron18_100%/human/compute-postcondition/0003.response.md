Output State: **`s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5, `pre` is a list of indices (1-based) where the character in `s1` is '>', `totalOne` is the number of '>' characters in `s1`, `preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0, `suffZero` is a list containing a single element 0.**

Explanation:
- `suffZero` is initialized as a list containing a single element 0.
- The initial state variables `s1`, `n`, `pre`, `totalOne`, and `preOne` remain unchanged.
