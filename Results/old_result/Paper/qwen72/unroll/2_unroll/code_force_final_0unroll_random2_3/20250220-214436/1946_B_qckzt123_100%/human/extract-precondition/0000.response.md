Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take no input parameters, but based on the problem description, it should be defined to take input parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `k` are integers representing the length of the array and the number of operations (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the required input parameters:

```python
def func(t, test_cases):
    # Each test case is a tuple (n, k, a)
    results = []
    for n, k, a in test_cases:
        # Function logic here
        pass
    return results
```

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5), and `a` (a list of integers of length `n` where -10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of the values of `n` and `k` for all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
