### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` and the array `a`.

2. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   - The array `a` is sorted and then reversed. This ensures that the largest elements are at the beginning of the array, which is useful for Alice's strategy to maximize the sum by removing the smallest elements.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - The initial sum of the array `sum1` is calculated.

4. **Dynamic Sum Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over the possible number of elements Alice can remove (from 0 to `k`).
   - For each iteration:
     - If `i` is 0, it calculates the sum after Bob multiplies the first `x` elements by -1.
     - If `i` is greater than 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, it updates the sum by considering the effect of Alice removing `i` elements and Bob multiplying the next `x` elements by -1.
     - If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, it updates the sum by considering the effect of Alice removing `i` elements and no further elements being multiplied by -1.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum value from the list `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- **Alice's Strategy**:
  - Alice should remove the smallest elements to maximize the sum. By sorting and reversing the array, the smallest elements are at the end, and removing them is straightforward.

- **Bob's Strategy**:
  - Bob should multiply the largest possible elements by -1 to minimize the sum. The function correctly considers the first `x` elements after Alice's removals.

- **Sum Calculation**:
  - The initial sum `sum1` is correctly calculated.
  - The dynamic sum calculation considers the effects of both Alice's removals and Bob's multiplications.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The function handles the case where `i` is 0 correctly.
  - It also handles the case where `i + x - 1` is less than `n` and where it is greater than or equal to `n`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the strategies for both Alice and Bob and calculates the optimal sum for each test case. The logic and the steps are sound and align with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
