t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n, m, and k, and two lists a and b. For each tuple, n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5), k is an even integer (2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m)), a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), and b is a list of m integers (1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6). The sum of values n and m over all test cases does not exceed 4·10^5.
