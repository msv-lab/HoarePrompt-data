You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer n where 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) within a test case are distinct.
def func():
    loop = int(input())
    for iterable in range(loop):
        less = []
        
        big = []
        
        no = []
        
        num = 0
        
        innerLoop = int(input())
        
        for iterable2 in range(innerLoop):
            x, a = map(int, input().split())
            if x == 1:
                big.append(a)
            elif x == 2:
                less.append(a)
            else:
                no.append(a)
        
        num = min(less) - max(big) + 1
        
        if num < 1:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        for i in no:
            if i <= min(less) and i >= max(big):
                num -= 1
        
        print(num)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the final state of the variables `less`, `big`, `no`, and `num` will be different for each test case based on the inputs provided. However, the variables `t`, `n`, and `loop` will remain unchanged. The output of the loop will be the number of valid integers that satisfy the constraints for each test case, or 0 if no such integers exist.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a set of `n` constraints. Each constraint is a pair `(a, x)` where `a` is 1, 2, or 3, and `x` is an integer. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
