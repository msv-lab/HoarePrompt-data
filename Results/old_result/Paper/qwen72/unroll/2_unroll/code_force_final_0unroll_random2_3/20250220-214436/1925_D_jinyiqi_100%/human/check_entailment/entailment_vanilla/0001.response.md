### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of friendship pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` for the given pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose a pair of children from `n` children using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is correctly computed as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions, considering the increase in friendship value for each chosen pair.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Inverse:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no friends (`m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value will be 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the friendship value will increase linearly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen, and it handles the modular arithmetic and simplification of the fraction appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
