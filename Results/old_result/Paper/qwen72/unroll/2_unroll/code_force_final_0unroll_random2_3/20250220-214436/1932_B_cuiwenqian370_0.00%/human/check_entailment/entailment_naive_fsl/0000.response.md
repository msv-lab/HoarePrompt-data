Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem is about finding the year when the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs. However, the program is implementing a dynamic programming solution for a different problem, which seems to be related to a path with '@' and '*' characters. This is not relevant to the given problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
