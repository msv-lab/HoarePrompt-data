Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves buying a specified number of tickets (`k`) over a given number of days (`n`), with a limit on the number of tickets that can be bought each day (`m`). The function reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of ticket prices for each day (`a`). It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets by sorting the ticket prices and buying the cheapest available tickets first, up to the daily limit. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the minimum total cost for each test case. The input variables `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged after each test case. **
