The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. For the loop to execute, `num` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, and `num` must be a positive integer to ensure that the loop runs at least once.

State: **`num` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
