### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`, and then reads the `n` rows of the river grid.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum cost of building a bridge on a single row.
   - The first loop increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1, which is correct because supports must be installed in these cells.
   - The second loop updates each element from `row[d-1]` to `row[len(row)-1]` to be the minimum value of the previous `d` elements plus the current value plus 1. This ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function returns the last element of the updated row, which represents the total cost of building the bridge on that row.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input for a single test case and processes it.
   - It calls `func_1` for each row to get the cost of building a bridge on that row.
   - It then calculates the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing up the costs of `k` consecutive rows and stores these sums in `total_costs`.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum value from `total_costs`, which is the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 1 correctly by simply finding the minimum cost of a single row.
   - It also handles the case where `d` is 1 correctly by ensuring that supports are installed in every cell.

5. **Constraints:**
   - The program respects the constraints provided in the problem description, including the limits on `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum total cost of building `k` consecutive bridges on a river grid, given the constraints and requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
