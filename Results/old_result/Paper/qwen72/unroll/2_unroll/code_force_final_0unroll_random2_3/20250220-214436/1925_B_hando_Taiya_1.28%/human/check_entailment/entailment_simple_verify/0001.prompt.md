You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
from math import *

tc = int(input())
for _ in range(tc):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.
def func_1():
    x, n = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, isqrt(x) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            elif n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
    #State: `t` remains unchanged, `x` and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `n` or the largest quotient of `x` divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to `n`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to n or the largest quotient of x divided by a divisor that is less than or equal to n)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

2. **Approach**:
   - The maximum balance is the largest integer `g` such that `g` divides `x` and `x // g` is at least `n`.
   - This is because if `g` is the GCD, then each sub-problem's difficulty must be a multiple of `g`, and the sum of these difficulties must be `x`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - For each test case, we need to find the largest divisor `i` of `x` such that `x // i` is at least `n`.
   - We iterate through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (since divisors come in pairs).
   - For each divisor `i`, we check if `x % i == 0` (i.e., `i` is a divisor of `x`).
   - If `i` is a divisor, we check if `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` and update the answer accordingly.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `tc` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n` and initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` using `isqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x % i == 0` and updates `ans` if the conditions `n <= x // i` or `n <= i` are met.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance `ans` for each test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `n` is equal to `x` by checking `n <= x // i` and `n <= i`.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is a prime number or `n` is 1, as the loop will correctly identify the largest divisor.

6. **Optimization**:
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures that the loop runs in \( O(\sqrt{x}) \) time, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. It efficiently checks all possible divisors and updates the answer based on the conditions given in the problem.

Correctness: **True**
