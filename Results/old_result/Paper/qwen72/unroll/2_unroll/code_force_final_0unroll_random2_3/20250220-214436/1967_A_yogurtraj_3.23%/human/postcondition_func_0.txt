The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` representing the initial number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by using the available coins. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain as they were initially, but the results for each test case have been printed.
