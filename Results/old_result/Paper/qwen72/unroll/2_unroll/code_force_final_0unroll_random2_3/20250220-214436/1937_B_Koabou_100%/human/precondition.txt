The function `solve` is part of a program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the width of a 2 × n grid, and two binary strings of length n representing the values in the two rows of the grid. The function should handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
