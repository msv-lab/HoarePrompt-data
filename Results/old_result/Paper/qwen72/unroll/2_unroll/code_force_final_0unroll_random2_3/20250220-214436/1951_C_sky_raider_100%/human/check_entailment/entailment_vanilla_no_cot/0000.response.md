Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of ticket prices for each day.

2. **Sorting the Prices**: The program sorts the list of ticket prices in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the program buys tickets on the cheapest days first, which helps minimize the total cost.

3. **Purchasing Tickets**: The program iterates through the sorted list of prices and buys the maximum number of tickets possible on each day (up to `m` tickets or until `k` tickets are bought). It updates the total cost `c` by adding the cost of the tickets bought on the current day, adjusted for the increase in price due to previous purchases (`t`).

4. **Adjusting for Price Increase**: The variable `t` keeps track of the total number of tickets bought so far, which is used to adjust the price of tickets on subsequent days. This is done correctly by adding `t` to the price of tickets on each day.

5. **Updating Remaining Tickets**: The program updates the number of remaining tickets `k` and the total number of tickets bought `t` after each purchase.

6. **Output**: The program prints the total cost for each test case, which is the correct output format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
