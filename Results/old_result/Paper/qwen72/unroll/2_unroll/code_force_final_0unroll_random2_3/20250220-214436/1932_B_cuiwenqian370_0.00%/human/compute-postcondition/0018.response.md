Postcondition: ***`path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character, `n` is the length of `path`, and `n` is greater than 0; `dp` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to 0. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to `-inf`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[0]` remains 0. If `n` > 1, and the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is set to `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then `dp[1]` is set to 1 if `path[1]` is '@' or 0 otherwise. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged except for `dp[0]` as described above.***
