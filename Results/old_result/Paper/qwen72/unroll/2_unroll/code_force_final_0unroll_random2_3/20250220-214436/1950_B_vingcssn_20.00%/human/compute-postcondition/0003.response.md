Functionality: **The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 20. For each iteration, the function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The function returns a value based on the input `n`, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.**
