Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given that each sign occurs periodically and must occur in a strict sequence. The solution should find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, adjusted for the sequential nature of the signs.

### Analysis of Function 1:
- **Function 1** (`func_1`) is described as processing a list of strings (`path`) where each string is either '@', '*', or some other character. However, this function does not seem to be related to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign. The function is designed to solve a different problem, possibly a dynamic programming problem involving paths with '@' and '*' characters.
- The function initializes a `dp` list and sets values based on the characters in `path`. It then returns the maximum value in `dp` that is greater than negative infinity.
- This function is not relevant to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign, and it does not perform the necessary calculations to solve the problem.

### Analysis of Function 2:
- **Function 2** (`func_2`) reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the number of signs `n` for each test case.
- However, it incorrectly treats the periodicities of the signs (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) as a single string `path` and passes it to `func_1`.
- **Function 2** is also not correctly solving the problem because it is using `func_1`, which is not designed to handle the periodicity and sequential nature of the signs.

### Conclusion:
- The program is **incorrect** because it does not solve the problem as described. The functions provided are not designed to find the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the periodicities of the signs.
- The correct approach would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities of the signs, adjusted for the sequential nature of the signs.

Correctness: **False**
