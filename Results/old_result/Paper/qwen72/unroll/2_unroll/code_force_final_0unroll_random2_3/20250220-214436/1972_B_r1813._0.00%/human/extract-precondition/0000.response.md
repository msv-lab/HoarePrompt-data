Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the state of the coins.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined to accept the parameters as described in the precondition. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple containing `n` and `s` for each test case.
