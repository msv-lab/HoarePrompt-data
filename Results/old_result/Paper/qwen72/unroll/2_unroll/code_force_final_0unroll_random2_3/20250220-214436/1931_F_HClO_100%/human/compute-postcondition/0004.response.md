Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of participants and the number of screenshots, then reads the order of participants shown in each screenshot. The function determines if the order of participants can be consistently derived from the screenshots. If the order is consistent, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the output will be a series of 'yes' or 'no' for each test case. **
