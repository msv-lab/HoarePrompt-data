The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or require two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where both `n` and `m` are within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The output of the function is not specified, so it is unclear what the function returns. 

Given the lack of explicit parameters and output in the function definition, the functionality of the function cannot be fully described without additional context. However, based on the constraints, we can infer that the function is designed to work with two positive integers within a specific range.

Functionality: **The function is designed to work with two positive integers, `n` and `m`, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, but the specific output or return value is not provided.**
