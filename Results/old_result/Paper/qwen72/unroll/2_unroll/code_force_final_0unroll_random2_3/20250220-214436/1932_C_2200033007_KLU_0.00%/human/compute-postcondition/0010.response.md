The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`. `n` and `m` are positive integers with the constraints 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= m <= 10^4. `a` is a list of `n` integers, each within the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^4. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'. The function returns a list `ans` which contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in their original order, where `b` is derived from the input parameters.
