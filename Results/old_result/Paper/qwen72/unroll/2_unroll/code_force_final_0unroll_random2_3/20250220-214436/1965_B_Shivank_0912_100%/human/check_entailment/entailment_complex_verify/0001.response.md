### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v != k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - The program determines the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` by finding the highest bit set in `k`.
   - It constructs a sequence `ans` that includes:
     - `k - (1 << i)`: This ensures that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that `k + 1` can be formed.
     - `k + 1 + (1 << i)`: This ensures that `k + 1 + (1 << i)` can be formed.
     - All powers of 2 from `1` to `2^19` except `2^i` (which is `1 << i`).

3. **Correctness of the Sequence:**
   - **Preventing Subsequence Sum to `k`:**
     - The inclusion of `k - (1 << i)` ensures that `k` cannot be formed because `k` would require `k - (1 << i) + (1 << i)`, but `(1 << i)` is excluded.
     - The other elements in the sequence are chosen to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any combination of the elements.
   - **Forming All Other Sums:**
     - By including all powers of 2 except `2^i`, the sequence can form any sum that is a combination of these powers.
     - The additional elements `k + 1` and `k + 1 + (1 << i)` ensure that sums around `k` can be formed, but not `k` itself.
   - **Sequence Size:**
     - The sequence `ans` is of size at most 25 because it includes at most 20 powers of 2, plus 3 additional elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **When `k` is a Power of 2:**
     - If `k` is a power of 2, the program correctly excludes that specific power of 2 from the sequence.
     - For example, if `k = 8`, the program will exclude `8` (which is `1 << 3`), and the sequence will include `7`, `9`, and `17` to ensure that `8` cannot be formed.
   - **General Case:**
     - The program ensures that the sequence can form all sums from `1` to `n` except `k` by including a wide range of powers of 2 and additional elements.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient and runs within the constraints provided.
   - The loop to find the highest bit set in `k` runs in constant time.
   - The loop to append powers of 2 runs in a fixed number of iterations (20).

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The input is correctly read and processed.
  - `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`.
  - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.

- **State After Finding `i`:**
  - The variable `i` is correctly determined as the largest integer such that `1 << i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`.
  - This ensures that `2^i` is the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

- **State After Constructing `ans`:**
  - The sequence `ans` is constructed to include `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, and all powers of 2 from `1 << 0` to `1 << 19` except `1 << i`.
  - The sequence `ans` is of size at most 25, which meets the problem's constraints.

- **State After Printing:**
  - The length of `ans` and the elements of `ans` are printed for each test case.
  - The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the loop completes.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from `1` to `n` to be formed. The sequence size is within the allowed limit, and the program handles edge cases appropriately.

Final: **True**
