Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is set to 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is set to `-inf`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[0]` remains 0.

If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[0]` remains 0. If `n` > 1, and the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is set to `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then `dp[1]` is set to 1 if `path[1]` is '@' or 0 otherwise. If `n` is 1, `dp` remains unchanged except for `dp[0]` as described above.
    for i in range(2, n):
        if path[i] == '*':

    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list that is greater than negative infinity. This value is calculated based on the conditions: if `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`; if `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1; otherwise, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1] and `dp[i-2]` plus 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a non-empty list of strings. Each string in `path` is either '@', '*', or some other character. The function returns the maximum value in a derived list `dp` that is greater than negative infinity. The `dp` list is constructed such that for each index `i` in `path`:
- If `path[i]` is '*', `dp[i]` is set to `-inf`.
- If `path[i]` is '@', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 1.
- If `path[i]` is neither '@' nor '*', `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]` plus 0.
If all elements in `path` are '*', the function returns 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and data is a list of strings containing the input data for t test cases.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        path = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        results.append(func_1(path))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer equal to the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings containing the input data for `t` test cases, `input` is now a function that reads from `sys.stdin`, `data` is updated to a list of strings split from the input read by `input()`, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each test case.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: The loop has printed each element in the `results` list, and the variables `t`, `data`, `input`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads from `sys.stdin`, processes `t` test cases where `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 1000`, and each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `path`. It applies `func_1` to each `path` and prints the results. After the function concludes, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each test case. The function does not return any value.
