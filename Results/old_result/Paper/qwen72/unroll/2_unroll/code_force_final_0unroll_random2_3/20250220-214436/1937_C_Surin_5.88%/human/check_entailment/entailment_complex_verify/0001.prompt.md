You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #State: The loop will execute `kp` times, where `kp` is the integer input at the beginning. For each iteration of the loop, `n` is set to the integer input provided for that iteration. After the loop completes, `v1` will be the largest integer less than `n` for which the first query returned '<', and `prev` will be the largest integer less than `n` for which the second query returned '>'. The final output for each iteration will be `! {prev} {v1}`. The initial state of the lambda function `R` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` operates in an interactive environment to find and output a pair of indices (i, j) from a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1} such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function reads an integer `kp` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), performs a series of queries to determine the indices, and outputs the pair of indices (i, j) that achieve the maximum XOR value. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the processed test cases with the corresponding pairs of indices printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) with \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_0 \) with each \( p_i \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \).
   - If \( p_{v1} \mid p_{v1} < p_i \mid p_i \), then \( p_{v1} < p_i \), and \( v1 \) is updated to \( i \).

3. **Finding the Second Index:**
   - Once \( v1 \) is determined, the program then finds the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \) maximizes \( p_{v1} \oplus p_{prev} \).
   - This is done by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( ? \, v1 \, i \, v1 \, prev \).
   - If \( p_{v1} \mid p_i > p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \), then \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

4. **Output the Result:**
   - After finding \( prev \) and \( v1 \), the program outputs \( ! \, prev \, v1 \) as the indices that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( v1 \).
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( prev \).
   - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

6. **Correctness of the Strategy:**
   - The strategy ensures that \( v1 \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop ensures that \( prev \) is the index that maximizes \( p_{v1} \oplus p_{prev} \).
   - The bitwise XOR operation \( p_{v1} \oplus p_{prev} \) will indeed be maximized because \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value, and the second loop finds the best \( p_{prev} \) to maximize the XOR.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly finds a pair of indices \( (i, j) \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most \( 3n \) queries. The logic and the number of queries are both sound and meet the problem's requirements.
