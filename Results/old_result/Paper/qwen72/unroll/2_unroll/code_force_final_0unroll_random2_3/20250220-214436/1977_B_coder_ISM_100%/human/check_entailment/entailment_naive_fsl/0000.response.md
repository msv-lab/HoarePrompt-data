Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the input `x` is 15. According to the problem description, the array should not have consecutive non-zero elements. However, the program's output for `x = 15` is:

```
5
-1 0 0 0 1
```

This output is incorrect because the sum of the array elements multiplied by their respective powers of 2 does not equal 15. The correct output should be something like:

```
5
-1 0 -1 0 1
```

This is because:
-1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^1 + -1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4 = -1 + 0 - 4 + 0 + 16 = 11

But the correct sum for 15 should be:
-1 * 2^0 + 0 * 2^1 + -1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^4 = -1 + 0 - 4 + 0 + 16 = 11

The program fails to correctly adjust the array to meet the requirement that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
