### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `T` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, which are within the specified range \(1 \le a, b \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).

2. **Formula Analysis:**
   - The program calculates `x` using the formula: 
     \[
     x = \left( \frac{a - i \cdot (i - 1)}{i^2} \right) + 1
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the formula itself is not directly derived from this condition.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if \(a - i \cdot (i - 1) > 0\) before adding `x` to `suma`.
   - This condition ensures that the numerator \(a - i \cdot (i - 1)\) is positive, which is necessary for the division to make sense.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program sums up the values of `x` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `b`.
   - It then prints `suma - 1` for each test case.

5. **Validation with Example:**
   - For the input `(2, 3)`, let's manually verify the calculation:
     - `i = 1`: 
       \[
       x = \left( \frac{2 - 1 \cdot (1 - 1)}{1^2} \right) + 1 = \left( \frac{2 - 0}{1} \right) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
       \]
     - `i = 2`: 
       \[
       x = \left( \frac{2 - 2 \cdot (2 - 1)}{2^2} \right) + 1 = \left( \frac{2 - 2}{4} \right) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1
       \]
     - `i = 3`: 
       \[
       x = \left( \frac{2 - 3 \cdot (3 - 1)}{3^2} \right) + 1 = \left( \frac{2 - 6}{9} \right) + 1 = -\frac{4}{9} + 1 = 0
       \]
     - Summing up: `suma = 3 + 1 + 0 = 4`
     - The program prints `suma - 1 = 3`, which is correct for the input `(2, 3)`.

6. **General Correctness:**
   - The formula used in the program is not straightforward and requires careful verification.
   - However, the original assessment correctly points out that the program does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for all pairs `(a, b)`.
   - The commented-out nested loop was intended to check all pairs, but the actual implementation uses a different approach that may not be correct for all inputs.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is correct in stating that the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
   - The formula used in the program is not derived from the problem's requirements and may lead to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
