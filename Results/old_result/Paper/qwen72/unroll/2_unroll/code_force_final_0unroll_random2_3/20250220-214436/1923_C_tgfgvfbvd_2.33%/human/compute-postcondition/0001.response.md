Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases. For each query, it has determined whether the sum of the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` is at least twice the length of the subarray, and printed 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `l` are no longer in scope, and the final state of the program is that all input has been processed and the corresponding outputs have been printed.**
