#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should include parameters for the array and the number of elements in the array, such as `def func(a, n):`, where `a` is a list of integers and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and each element `a_i` in `a` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    """Median of Array"""
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
        
        res = a.count(a[p])
        
        print(res)
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations. `t` is an input integer that has not been modified. For each iteration, `n` and `a` are redefined based on user input, `a` is sorted, `p` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, and `res` is the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`. The value of `res` is printed for each iteration. The final values of `n`, `a`, `p`, and `res` correspond to the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a` from the user. It then sorts the list `a`, calculates the index `p` as `(n + 1) // 2 - 1`, and prints the count of the element at index `p` in the sorted list `a`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the final values of `n`, `a`, `p`, and `res` correspond to the last test case processed.
