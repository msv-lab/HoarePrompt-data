### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The variable `t` is initially set to `b`, which is the number of 2x2 icons.
   - The function then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `t // 2` if `t` is even, or `t // 2 + 1` if `t` is odd. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 3 icons of size 2x2 (since 3 * 4 = 12 cells).

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - It then checks if the remaining space is sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`a`). If `t1 >= a`, it means the current number of screens `t` is enough, and no additional screens are needed.
   - If `t1 < a`, it calculates the additional number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`. The number of additional screens is `t2 // 15` if `t2` is a multiple of 15, or `t2 // 15 + 1` otherwise. This is correct because each screen can hold up to 15 icons of size 1x1.

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons based on the given problem description and constraints. The logic for handling the 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons is sound and follows the rules specified in the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
