The function `func_1` should accept a parameter `s`, which is a binary string. However, the provided function definition is incomplete and does not include this parameter. Assuming the function is correctly defined to accept a binary string `s`, the function's output is not specified in the provided information. 

Without the specific output details, I can only describe the expected input parameter. If you provide the output details, I can complete the functionality description.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string `s` as a parameter.**
