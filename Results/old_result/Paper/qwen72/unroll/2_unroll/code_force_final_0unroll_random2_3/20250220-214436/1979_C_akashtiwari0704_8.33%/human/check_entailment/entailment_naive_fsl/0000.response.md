Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where all multipliers \( k_i \) are the same. For example, consider the following input:

```
2
2
3 3
```

The program will calculate the product of the multipliers as \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \). Then, it will set each bet to \( 9 // 3 = 3 \). The total sum of bets will be \( 3 + 3 = 6 \), which is not strictly less than the product \( 9 \). Therefore, the program will output `-1` for this case, even though a valid solution exists (e.g., \( 1 \) and \( 1 \)).

This indicates that the program does not always find a valid solution when one exists, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
