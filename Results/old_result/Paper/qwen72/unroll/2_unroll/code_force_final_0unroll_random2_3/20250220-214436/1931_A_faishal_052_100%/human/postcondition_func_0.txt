The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78). It processes each `n` to generate a sorted list of three integers, where the first two integers are either 1, 26, or 52 based on the initial value of `n`, and the third integer is the remaining value of `n` after the processing. The function then converts these integers to lowercase letters by adding 96 to each and prints the resulting string for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the decoded strings.
