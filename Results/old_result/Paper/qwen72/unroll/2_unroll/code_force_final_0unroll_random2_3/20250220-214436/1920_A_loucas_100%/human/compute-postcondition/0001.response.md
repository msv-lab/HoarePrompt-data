To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `iterable` and `loop`.

1. **`iterable`**: This variable is automatically managed by the `range` function and will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. **`loop`**: The loop will execute if `loop` is greater than 0. If `loop` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains an integer `n` where 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints.
- Each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) within a test case are distinct.
- `loop` is an input integer.

To ensure the loop executes, `loop` must be greater than 0. The variable `iterable` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100, each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) within a test case are distinct, `loop` must be greater than 0, `iterable` is 0**
