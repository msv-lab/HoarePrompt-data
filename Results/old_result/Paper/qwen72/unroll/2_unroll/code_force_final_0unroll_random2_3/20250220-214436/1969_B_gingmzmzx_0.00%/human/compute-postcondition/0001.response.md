The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `s` (the binary string) is not relevant to the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
