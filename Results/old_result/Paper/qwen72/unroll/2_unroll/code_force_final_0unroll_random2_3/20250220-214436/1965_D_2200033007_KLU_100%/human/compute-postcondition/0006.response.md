The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of a hidden palindrome array, and `n`, which is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, indicating the size of the array `a`.

The function returns the list `a` where the elements at the middle index `(n - 1) // 2` and its symmetric counterpart `n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2` are filled with values derived from the `odds` list. For each value in `odds`, if the current index is the middle index, the corresponding element in `a` is set to that value. Otherwise, the elements at the current index and its symmetric counterpart are set to half the difference between the current value and the previous value in `odds`. The function processes all elements in `odds` to fill the array `a` accordingly.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of size `n` where the elements at the middle index and its symmetric counterpart are filled based on the values in `odds`. For each value in `odds`, if the current index is the middle index, the corresponding element in `a` is set to that value. Otherwise, the elements at the current index and its symmetric counterpart are set to half the difference between the current value and the previous value in `odds`.**
