The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. 

However, the provided function signature does not explicitly list the parameters. Assuming the function is meant to accept these parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. It returns a result for each test case based on the provided `n` and `a`. The total number of test cases `t` is a positive integer, and the sum of the values of `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
