t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5. Each of the k lines contains n integers a_{ij} (1 ≤ a_{ij} ≤ n), all different, representing the order of participants shown to the participant a_{i0}, who is the author of the screenshot and always appears at the top of their own list. The sum of n · k over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and all authors of the screenshots are different.
