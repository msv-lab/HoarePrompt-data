You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . Output a 2n \times 2n checkerboard made of 2
\times 2 squares alternating '\texttt{#} ' and '\texttt{.} ', with the top-
left cell being '\texttt{#} '.

The picture above shows the answers for n=1,2,3,4 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 20 ) — the number of test
cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 20
) — it means you need to output a checkerboard of side length 2n .

Output

For each test case, output 2n lines, each containing 2n characters without
spaces — the checkerboard, as described in the statement. Do not output empty
lines between test cases.

- Program:
def func():
    casos = int(input())
    for c in range(0, casos):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('##')
            print('##')
        elif n == 2:
            print('##..')
            print('##..')
            print('..##')
            print('..##')
        elif n == 3:
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
            print('..##..')
            print('..##..')
            print('##..##')
            print('##..##')
        elif n == 4:
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
            print('##..##..')
            print('##..##..')
            print('..##..##')
            print('..##..##')
        else:
            print('No esta en el rango')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` is designed to be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 20. For each iteration, the function reads an integer `n` from the user input, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 20. The function prints a specific pattern of '##' and '.' characters based on the value of `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints two lines of '##'. If `n` is 2, it prints four lines of '##..' followed by four lines of '..##'. If `n` is 3, it prints six lines of '##..##' followed by six lines of '..##..'. If `n` is 4, it prints eight lines of '##..##..' followed by eight lines of '..##..##'. If `n` is outside the range 1 to 4, it prints 'No esta en el rango'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `casos` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` will be the last input provided.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `casos`, and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Checkerboard Generation**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to handle different values of `n`.
   - For `n = 1`, it prints a 2x2 checkerboard with all cells as `#`.
   - For `n = 2`, it prints a 4x4 checkerboard with the correct pattern of alternating `#` and `.`.
   - For `n = 3`, it prints a 6x6 checkerboard with the correct pattern of alternating `#` and `.`.
   - For `n = 4`, it prints an 8x8 checkerboard with the correct pattern of alternating `#` and `.`.
   - For any other value of `n`, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which translates to "Not in the range").

3. **Pattern Correctness**:
   - The patterns for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` are correct as per the problem description.
   - However, the program does not handle values of `n` greater than 4, which is a limitation. The problem description states that `1 <= n <= 20`, so the program should be able to handle any value within this range.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program correctly outputs the checkerboard without spaces and without empty lines between test cases, as required by the problem description.

5. **Generalization**:
   - The program lacks a general solution for any `n` within the range `1 <= n <= 20`. It only handles specific cases (`n = 1, 2, 3, 4`) and fails to generate the correct pattern for other values.

Given these points, the program is not fully correct because it does not handle all valid inputs as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
