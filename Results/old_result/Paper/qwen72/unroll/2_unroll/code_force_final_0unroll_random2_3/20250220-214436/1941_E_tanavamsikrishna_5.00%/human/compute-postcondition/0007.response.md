Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are unchanged.
   - `rows` is unchanged.
   - `costs` is unchanged.
   - `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list starting from index `i`.

2. **Understanding `total_costs`**:
   - The length of `total_costs` is `n - (k - 1)`, which simplifies to `n - k + 1`.
   - Each element in `total_costs` is the sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list starting from a specific index `i`.

3. **What `min(total_costs)` does**:
   - The `min` function will return the smallest value from the list `total_costs`.

4. **Output**:
   - The `print(min(total_costs))` statement will print the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and `costs` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `min(total_costs)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest sum of `k` consecutive elements from the `costs` list.

Output: **min(total_costs) (where total_costs is a list of sums of k consecutive elements from the costs list)**
