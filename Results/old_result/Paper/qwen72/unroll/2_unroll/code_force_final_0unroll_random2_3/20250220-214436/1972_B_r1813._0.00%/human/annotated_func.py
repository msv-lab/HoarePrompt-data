#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a string s of length n with characters "U" and "D" representing the state of the coins.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        s = data[index]
        
        index += 1
        
        num_up_coins = s.count('U')
        
        if num_up_coins % 2 == 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: `index` is `1 + 2 * t`. `t` remains the same as the initial value. `results` is a list of strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the count of 'U' in each `s` is odd or even, respectively.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `index` is `1 + 2 * t`. `t` remains the same as the initial value. `results` is a list of strings, each either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the count of 'U' in each `s` is odd or even, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints the result for each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". The function determines whether the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes an updated `index` (which is `1 + 2 * t`), the original `t` value, and a list `results` containing the outcomes ("YES" or "NO") for each test case.
