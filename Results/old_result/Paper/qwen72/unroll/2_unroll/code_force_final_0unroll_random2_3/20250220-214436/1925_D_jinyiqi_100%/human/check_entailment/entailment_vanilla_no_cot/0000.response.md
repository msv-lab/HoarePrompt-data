Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of the logic and why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Input for Each Test Case**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.

3. **Summing Friendship Values**: It then reads the friendship values for each pair of friends and sums them up in `sum_f`.

4. **Calculating Combinations**: It calculates the number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children using the combination formula `n * (n - 1) // 2` and stores it in `cn2`.

5. **Calculating Expected Value**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the initial friendship values and the incremental increase in friendship values for each chosen pair.

6. **Simplifying the Fraction**: The program simplifies the fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `p` and `q` and then dividing both `p` and `q` by this gcd.

7. **Modular Inverse and Final Output**: It calculates the modular inverse of `q` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) and then computes the final result as \(p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7)\).

The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements, ensuring that the output is the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all chosen pairs, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Therefore, the program is correct.
