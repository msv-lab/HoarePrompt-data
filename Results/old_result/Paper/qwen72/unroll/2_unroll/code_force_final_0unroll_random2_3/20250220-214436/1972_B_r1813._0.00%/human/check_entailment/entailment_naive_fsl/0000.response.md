Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program only checks the parity of the number of facing-up coins to determine the winner, which is insufficient to accurately model the game's rules.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
UUD
```
According to the program, the number of facing-up coins is 2, which is even, so it would output "NO". However, if we simulate the game:

1. Alice chooses the first coin ('U'), and the string becomes "DD".
2. Bob chooses the first coin ('D'), and the string becomes "D".
3. Alice chooses the only remaining coin ('D'), and the string becomes empty.
4. Bob has no coins to choose, so Alice wins.

The correct output for this test case should be "YES", but the program outputs "NO". This demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
