### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results of each test case.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (i.e., `k != x`).
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (initially).
   - It initializes `bx` to a very small number (`-1`) to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (initially).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a == 1` (i.e., `k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
   - If `a == 2` (i.e., `k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
   - If `a == 3` (i.e., `k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy `bx <= k <= ax` and are not in the set `cx`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - It initializes a variable `tmp` to count the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It iterates through the set `cx` and increments `tmp` for each value `i` that is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It calculates the total number of valid integers as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appends this value to the result list `r`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly handles the constraints `k >= x` and `k <= x` by updating `bx` and `ax` respectively.
  - It ensures that `bx` is the maximum of all `k >= x` constraints and `ax` is the minimum of all `k <= x` constraints.

- **Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly handles the constraints `k != x` by storing these values in a set `cx`.
  - It then correctly counts how many of these values fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, returning `0` as expected.
  - It also correctly handles the case where there are no values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and input format. It handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
