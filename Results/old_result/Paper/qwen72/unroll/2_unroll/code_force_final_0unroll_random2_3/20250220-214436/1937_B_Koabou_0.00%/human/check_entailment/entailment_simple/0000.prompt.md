Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

In the second test case, the lexicographically smallest string is
\mathtt{11000} . There is only one path that yields this string:

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: a positive integer t representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n where each n[i] is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a list of tuples grid where each grid[i] contains two binary strings representing the rows of the 2 × n[i] grid. The total sum of all n[i] values does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two input integers, and the values of `t`, `n`, and `grid` remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged, `s` contains the concatenated string from `a[0]` up to the first occurrence of '1' in `a[0]` and the rest of the string from `a[1]` starting from the position where `a[1]` has a '0', or if no such condition is met, `s` is the concatenation of `a[0]` and the last character of `a[1]`. `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` is the index where the condition was met or `n-1` if the condition was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(x):
        if a[0][:i + 1] == s[:i + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: `a` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `t` is the value of `x - i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, or `1` if the loop completes without breaking, `n` remains unchanged, `grid` remains unchanged, and `x` remains unchanged.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: s (where s is the value of the variable `s` as defined in the initial state)
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is the value of `x - i + 1` at the point where the loop breaks, or `1` if the loop completes without breaking)
