Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to correctly process cases where the transformation of an element into its digits can affect the sorting of subsequent elements. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
3
4
12 3 45 67
3
12 28 5
2
90 1
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
NO
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
YES
NO
NO
```

In the third test case, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not consider that the number 90 can be split into 9 and 0, which would result in the array `[9, 0, 1]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program only checks the immediate transformation and does not account for the possibility of further transformations that could lead to a sorted array.
