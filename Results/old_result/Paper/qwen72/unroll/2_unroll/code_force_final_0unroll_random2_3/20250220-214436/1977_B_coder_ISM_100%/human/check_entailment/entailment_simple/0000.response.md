### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a positive integer `x` and processes it.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program initializes a list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` as a list of strings ('0' or '1').
   - It iterates through the bits of `x` from 0 to 29 (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)) and appends '1' if the bit is set and '0' otherwise.

3. **Adjusting the Representation**:
   - The program uses a flag to handle the conversion from binary to the required format.
   - It iterates through the list `s` and adjusts the values to ensure no two consecutive non-zero values exist:
     - If `flag` is set and `s[i]` is '0', it changes `s[i]` to '1' and resets the flag.
     - If `flag` is not set and `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` are both '1', it changes `s[i]` to '-1' and sets the flag.
     - If `flag` is set and `s[i]` is not '0', it changes `s[i]` to '0'.
     - If `flag` is set and `s[29]` is '0', it changes `s[29]` to '1'.
     - If `flag` is set and `s[29]` is not '0', it changes `s[29]` to '0' and appends '1' to the list, increasing the length by 1.

4. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The program iterates through the list `s` again to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist by adjusting '1' followed by '-1' to '0' and '-1'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified list `s` and the list itself.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Binary Representation**:
  - The initial binary representation is correct, as it correctly identifies the bits of `x`.

- **Adjustment Logic**:
  - The adjustment logic is designed to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero values exist in the list `s`.
  - The flag mechanism is used to carry over the adjustments to the next bit, which is necessary for handling cases where consecutive '1's need to be converted to '-1' and '0'.

- **Final Adjustment**:
  - The final adjustment ensures that any '1' followed by '-1' is correctly adjusted to '0' and '-1', which is a necessary step to meet the problem constraints.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles edge cases such as when `x` is a power of 2 or when `x` is a small number correctly.
  - The program also correctly handles the case where the final bit needs to be adjusted and the length of the list needs to be increased.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to convert the binary representation of `x` into a valid array of integers `a_i` that meets the problem constraints. The adjustments and final output are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
