Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to count the number of possible initial arrays `a` that can result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.
   - It uses dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the possible prefix sums at each step.
   - The `dp` array is initialized with a size of `2 * n + 1` to handle all possible prefix sums from `-n` to `n`.
   - The `offset` variable is used to shift the indices of the `dp` array so that negative sums can be represented.
   - The function iterates through the length of the array `n` and updates the `dp` array based on the possible transitions from the current prefix sum to the next prefix sum by adding or subtracting 1.
   - However, the function raises a `NameError` because the variable `final_sum` is not defined correctly before it is used in the return statement. This is a critical error that prevents the function from returning the correct result.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from `sys.stdin` and processes it to handle multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results of `func_1` are collected in a list `results` and printed at the end.
   - The function `func_2` itself is correctly structured and should work as intended if `func_1` were to return the correct values.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program is designed to solve the problem as described, but it fails due to the `NameError` in `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` were to correctly compute and return the number of possible initial arrays `a` for each test case, the program would be correct.

Given the critical error in `func_1`, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
