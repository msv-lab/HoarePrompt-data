The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes a series of test cases, and prints the result for each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing characters "U" and "D". The function determines whether the number of "U" characters in `s` is odd. If the count is odd, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes an updated `index` (which is `1 + 2 * t`), the original `t` value, and a list `results` containing the outcomes ("YES" or "NO") for each test case.
