The only objects in the loop head are the variables `c` and `casos`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `casos`. If `casos` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `c` will start at 0 and increment by 1 with each iteration. The function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, but this is not directly relevant to the loop head provided. For the loop to execute, `casos` must be greater than 0, and `c` must start at 0.

State: **`c` is 0, `casos` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ `casos` ≤ 20**
