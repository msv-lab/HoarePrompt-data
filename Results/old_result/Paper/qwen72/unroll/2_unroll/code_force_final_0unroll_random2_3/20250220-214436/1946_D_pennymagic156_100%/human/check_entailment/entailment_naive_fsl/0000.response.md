Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in handling the bitwise operations and the conditions specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` contains elements that, when XORed together, result in a value that is not less than or equal to `x`.

Here is a test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4 2
1 3 3 7
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output a value other than `-1`.

**Explanation:**
For the input array `[1, 3, 3, 7]` and `x = 2`, the program should return `-1` because there is no way to partition the array into segments such that the bitwise OR of the XOR results of these segments is less than or equal to `2`. However, the program does not correctly handle this case and returns an incorrect value.
