The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t` and the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly relevant to the loop head, but they are part of the initial state provided.

Given that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, the loop will execute if the input value is within the valid range for `t`.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
