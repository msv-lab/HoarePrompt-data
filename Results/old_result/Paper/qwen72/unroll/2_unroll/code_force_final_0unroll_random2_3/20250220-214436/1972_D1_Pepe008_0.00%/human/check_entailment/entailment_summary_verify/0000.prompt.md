You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import  math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (a, b) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        'for i in range(1,a+1):\n        for j in range(4,b+1):\n            if int((j+i)%(j*math.gcd(i,j))) == 0:\n                print(i,j)'
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, b + 1):
            x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1
            if a - i * (i - 1) > 0:
                suma += x
        print(suma - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 2 * 10^6`. The function then calculates a value `suma` based on these inputs and prints `suma - 1` for each test case. The function does not return any value. The values of `n` and `m` are not modified by the function, as they are not used within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the nested loop that was commented out in the provided code is intended to check all pairs `(i, j)` for the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the actual implementation in the program only considers the range `1` to `b` for `i` and calculates `x` using a formula that does not seem to correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

For example, consider the input `(2, 3)`. According to the problem description, the valid pairs are `(1, 1)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(2, 2)`. However, the program's logic for calculating `x` and summing it does not correctly account for these pairs. The program will output `2` instead of `3` for this input, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for each pair. The current implementation skips this step and uses a different, incorrect formula.
