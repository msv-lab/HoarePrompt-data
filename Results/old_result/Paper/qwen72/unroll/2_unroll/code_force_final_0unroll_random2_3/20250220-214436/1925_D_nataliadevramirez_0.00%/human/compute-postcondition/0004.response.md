Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by `m` lines of friendship data. It then calls `func_1` with `n`, `m`, `k`, and the friendship data, and prints the result of `func_1`. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` remains unchanged, but the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` are not retained between iterations. **
