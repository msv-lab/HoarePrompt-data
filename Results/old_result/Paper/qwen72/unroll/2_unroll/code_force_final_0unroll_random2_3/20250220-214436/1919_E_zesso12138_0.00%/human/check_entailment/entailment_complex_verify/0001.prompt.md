You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `p` of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. It initializes a list `dp` of size `2 * n + 1` with zeros and an `offset` of `n`. The function then updates the `dp` list through a series of operations based on the elements of `p`. However, the function ultimately raises a `NameError` because the variable `final_sum` is not defined correctly before it is used in the return statement. As a result, the function does not return a value.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to extract multiple sets of data, and applies a function `func_1` to each set. It then prints the results of `func_1` for each set. The function does not explicitly accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` holds the number of test cases, `n` holds the size of the last processed list, `p` holds the last processed list of integers, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is the total number of elements processed from `data`, and `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of initial arrays `a` of size `n` consisting only of 1 and -1, such that the sorted prefix sum array `p` matches the given sorted prefix sum array.
   - The prefix sum array `p` is defined as \( p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The function `func_1` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem.
   - `dp` is an array of size `2 * n + 1` to account for all possible prefix sums ranging from `-n` to `n`.
   - `offset` is used to shift the indices of `dp` to handle negative prefix sums.
   - `dp[offset]` is initialized to 1, representing the base case where the prefix sum is 0 at the start.
   - For each element in the array `a`, we update the `dp` array to reflect the possible prefix sums after adding 1 or -1.
   - The final result is obtained by checking the value of `dp` at the index corresponding to the final prefix sum \( p[-1] + offset \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The `dp` array is correctly initialized and updated.
   - The loop iterates through each element of the array `a`, updating the `dp` array based on the possible transitions (adding 1 or -1).
   - The modulo operation ensures that the values do not overflow and are within the required range.
   - The final sum is calculated correctly by adding the offset to the last element of `p`.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are stored in a list and printed at the end.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 and the prefix sum array `p` is `[0]` or `[1]` as expected.
   - It correctly identifies that there are no valid arrays `a` for the prefix sum array `p = [-1, 1, 2]`.
   - It correctly identifies the valid arrays `a` for the prefix sum array `p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` and `p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1]`.

6. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied to ensure the result is within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and handles the problem as described. It correctly counts the number of initial arrays `a` that result in the given sorted prefix sum array `p` and outputs the result modulo 998,244,353.

Correctness: **True**
