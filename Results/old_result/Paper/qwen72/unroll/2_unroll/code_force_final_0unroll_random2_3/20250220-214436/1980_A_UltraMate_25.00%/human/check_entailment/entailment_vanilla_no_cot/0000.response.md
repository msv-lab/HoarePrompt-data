Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not account for the difficulty level 'G'. The string `p = 'ABCDEF'` is used to check for the presence and count of each difficulty level, but it should include 'G' as well to ensure all required difficulty levels are considered. The correct string should be `p = 'ABCDEFG'`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Include 'G' in the string
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            else:
                if hmp[i] < m:
                    ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

This corrected program will now properly account for the 'G' difficulty level and correctly calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to come up with to hold the required number of rounds.
