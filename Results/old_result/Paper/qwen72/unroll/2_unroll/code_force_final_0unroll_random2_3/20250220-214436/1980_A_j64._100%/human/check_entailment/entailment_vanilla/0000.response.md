### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `a` which represents the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program initializes a list `count` of size 7 with zeros. This list is used to count the occurrences of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'.
   - It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in the `count` list based on the difficulty level of each problem. This is done using the expression `ord(char) - ord('A')`, which maps 'A' to 0, 'B' to 1, and so on.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems:**
   - The program initializes a variable `needed_problems` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the `count` list and checks if the number of problems of each difficulty level is less than `m`.
   - If the count for a particular difficulty level is less than `m`, it calculates the difference `m - count[i]` and adds this difference to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(n, m, a)` for each test case, which is the minimum number of problems needed to hold `m` rounds.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 1`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Reason: The string `BGECDCBDED` contains all difficulties except 'A' and 'F'. Therefore, Vlad needs to come up with 2 problems: one 'A' and one 'F'.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `10 2`, `BGECDCBDED`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - Reason: The string `BGECDCBDED` contains only one 'A', one 'F', and no 'G'. Therefore, Vlad needs to come up with 5 problems: one 'A', one 'F', and three 'G'.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `9 1`, `BBCDEFFGG`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - Reason: The string `BBCDEFFGG` contains all difficulties except 'A'. Therefore, Vlad needs to come up with 1 problem: one 'A'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of problems needed to hold `m` rounds. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and produces the correct results for the given test cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
