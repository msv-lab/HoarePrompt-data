Output State: **The loop iterates through t inputs, and for each input string s, it generates a shuffled version s2. If s2 is different from s, it prints 'Yes' followed by s2. If s2 is the same as s, it prints 'No'. The value of t remains unchanged, and each s is processed independently, so no state variables are altered outside of the loop's scope.**
