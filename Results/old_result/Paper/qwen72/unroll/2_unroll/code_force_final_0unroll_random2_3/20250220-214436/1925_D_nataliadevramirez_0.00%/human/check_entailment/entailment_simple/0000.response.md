### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The final answer should be in the form of \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - **Function `func_1`:**
     - This function takes `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` as input.
     - It iterates over each friendship and calculates the contribution of each friendship to the total expected value.
     - The formula used is \( f \cdot \left( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \right) \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).
     - This formula is incorrect because it does not account for the probability of selecting a pair of friends in each excursion.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - For each friendship, the probability of being chosen in any given excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a pair of friends in one excursion is \( \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - Over k excursions, the expected increase in the friendship value for a pair of friends is \( k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The total expected value for a friendship pair (a, b, f) is \( f + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \).
   - The sum of the expected values for all m pairs is \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \right) \).

4. **Modifying the Program:**
   - The correct formula should be \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + k \cdot \frac{2}{n(n-1)} \right) \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).
   - The program should calculate the modular inverse of \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) to handle the division in the modulo operation.

5. **Current Program Issues:**
   - The program does not account for the probability of selecting a pair of friends.
   - The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect and does not match the expected value calculation.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for the excursions. The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect and does not account for the probability of selecting a pair of friends.

Correctness: **False**
