You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #State: `r` is a list of integers, each representing the number of valid integers between the maximum of type 1 constraints and the minimum of type 2 constraints, excluding any type 3 constraints, for each test case. The length of `r` is equal to `t`.

    #[r[t-1]] (where each r[i] is the number of valid integers for the i-th test case)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is a pair (a, x) where `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3} and `x` is an integer. The function processes these constraints to determine the number of valid integers for each test case. A valid integer is one that lies between the maximum of type 1 constraints (`bx`) and the minimum of type 2 constraints (`ax`), excluding any type 3 constraints (`cx`). The function then prints these results, one per test case, each on a new line. The final state of the program is that `r` is a list of integers, each representing the number of valid integers for the corresponding test case, and `r` has a length equal to `t`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes an empty list `r` to store the results of each test case.
   - It initializes a set `cx` to store the values of `x` for constraints of type 3 (i.e., `k != x`).
   - It initializes `ax` to a very large number (`1000000000 + 7`) to represent the maximum possible value of `k` (initially).
   - It initializes `bx` to a very small number (`-1`) to represent the minimum possible value of `k` (initially).

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If `a == 1` (i.e., `k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
   - If `a == 2` (i.e., `k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
   - If `a == 3` (i.e., `k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation**:
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If this is true, it means there is no valid `k` that can satisfy both `k >= bx` and `k <= ax`, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - If `bx` is less than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy `bx <= k <= ax` and are not in the set `cx`.

5. **Counting Valid Integers**:
   - It initializes a variable `tmp` to count the number of values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It iterates through the set `cx` and increments `tmp` for each value `i` that is within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - It calculates the total number of valid integers as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp` and appends this value to the result list `r`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases, each on a new line.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly handles the constraints `k >= x` and `k <= x` by updating `bx` and `ax` respectively.
  - It ensures that `bx` is the maximum of all `k >= x` constraints and `ax` is the minimum of all `k <= x` constraints.

- **Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The program correctly handles the constraints `k != x` by storing these values in a set `cx`.
  - It then correctly counts how many of these values fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, returning `0` as expected.
  - It also correctly handles the case where there are no values in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem based on the given constraints and input format. It handles all edge cases and correctly calculates the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
