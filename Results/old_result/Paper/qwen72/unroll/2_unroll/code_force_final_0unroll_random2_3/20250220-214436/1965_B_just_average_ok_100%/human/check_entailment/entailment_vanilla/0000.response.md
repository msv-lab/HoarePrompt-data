### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25.
   - The sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`.
   - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v â‰  k`, there should be a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

2. **Initial Sequence Construction:**
   - The program starts by constructing a sequence `nums` of powers of 2 up to `2^20` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ..., 1048576]`).
   - This sequence has the property that any integer `v` in the range `[1, 2^21 - 1]` can be represented as a sum of a subsequence of these elements (since every integer can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2).

3. **Finding the Index:**
   - The program then finds the index `idx` of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - This is done by iterating through the `nums` list and stopping when the next power of 2 exceeds `k`.

4. **Modifying the Sequence:**
   - The program appends three new elements to the sequence:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that the sequence can represent sums up to `k-1` without including `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that the sequence can represent sums greater than `k`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This is an additional element to help cover more sums.
   - The program then removes the element `1 << idx` from the sequence. This is the power of 2 that is closest to `k` but not greater than `k`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the modified sequence and the sequence itself.

### Analysis:

- **Sequence Properties:**
  - By removing `1 << idx` and adding `k - nums[idx]`, the sequence ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k` because the removed element was the only one that could contribute to the sum `k`.
  - The added elements `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` help cover the sums that would otherwise be missing due to the removal of `1 << idx`.

- **Size Constraint:**
  - The initial sequence has 21 elements (powers of 2 up to `2^20`).
  - After removing one element and adding three new elements, the sequence has at most 23 elements, which is within the allowed limit of 25.

- **Correctness of the Solution:**
  - The sequence `nums` after modification ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`.
  - The sequence can still represent all other sums in the range `[1, n]` because the removed element is replaced with elements that cover the necessary sums.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
