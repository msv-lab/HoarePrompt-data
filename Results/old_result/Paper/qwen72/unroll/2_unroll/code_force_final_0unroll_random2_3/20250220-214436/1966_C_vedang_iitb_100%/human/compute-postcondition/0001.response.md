The only objects in the loop head are the variable `tc` and the input integer `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. However, this information about `test_cases` does not directly affect the loop head, so it remains unchanged. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `tc` must start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
