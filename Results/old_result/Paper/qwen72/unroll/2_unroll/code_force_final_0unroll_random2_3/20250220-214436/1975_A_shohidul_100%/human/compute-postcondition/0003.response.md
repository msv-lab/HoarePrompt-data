The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, an integer between 1 and 1000, `n`, an integer between 2 and 50, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
