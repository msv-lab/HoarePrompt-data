You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n (the number of children), m (the number of pairs of friends), and k (the number of excursions). Each of these parameters is an integer, with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5. Additionally, the function should take a list of m tuples, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value, with constraints 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n and m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

    #State: The loop executes `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, then reads `m` tuples of integers `a`, `b`, and `f` from the input. After processing these inputs, it calculates and prints the result of the formula `(2 * k * n * (n - 1) // 2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)) // (2 * (n * (n - 1) // 2)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of friendship pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` for the given pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose a pair of children from `n` children using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is correctly computed as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions, considering the increase in friendship value for each chosen pair.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Inverse:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no friends (`m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value will be 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the friendship value will increase linearly.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen, and it handles the modular arithmetic and simplification of the fraction appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
