### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of friendship pairs and their initial friendship values.

2. **Sum of Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` for the given pairs of friends.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose a pair of children from `n` children using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is correctly computed as `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions, considering the increase in friendship value for each chosen pair. However, let's break down the formula to ensure it is correct:
     - The term \(2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f}\) represents the contribution of the initial friendship values to the expected sum over `k` excursions.
     - The term \(m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)\) represents the increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over `k` excursions. This is because each pair of friends can be chosen multiple times, and each time they are chosen, their friendship value increases by 1.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Inverse:**
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where there are no friends (`m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value will be 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the friendship value will increase linearly.

### Verification of the Formula:
- The formula given in the program is:
  \[
  \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
  \]
- Let's verify this step-by-step:
  - The total number of pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for a single excursion is \(\frac{\text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
  - Over `k` excursions, the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
    \[
    k \cdot \frac{\text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}}
    \]
  - Additionally, each pair of friends that is chosen has its friendship value increased by 1 for each subsequent excursion. The expected number of times a specific pair of friends is chosen is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\). Therefore, the total increase in friendship value for all pairs of friends over `k` excursions is:
    \[
    m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
    \]
  - Combining these, the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions is:
    \[
    k \cdot \frac{\text{sum\_f}}{\binom{n}{2}} + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
    \]
  - Simplifying the above expression:
    \[
    \frac{k \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2}}{\binom{n}{2}}
    \]
  - Multiplying the numerator and the denominator by 2 to avoid the fraction inside the numerator:
    \[
    \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}}
    \]
  - Since \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), the formula becomes:
    \[
    \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \left(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{sum\_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}
    \]
  - This matches the formula used in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen, and it handles the modular arithmetic and simplification of the fraction appropriately. The formula used in the program is mathematically sound and matches the expected value calculation.

Final: **True**
