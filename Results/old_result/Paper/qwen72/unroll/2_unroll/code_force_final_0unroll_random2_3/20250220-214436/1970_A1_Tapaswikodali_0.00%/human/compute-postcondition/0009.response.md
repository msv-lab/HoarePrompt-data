Functionality: ** The function takes no parameters and operates on a non-empty string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")", where `s` is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. It reads the string `s` from user input, processes it to maintain a balance of parentheses, and then prints the reverse of the original string `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the original string `s` remains unchanged, and the printed output is the reversed string of `s`. **
