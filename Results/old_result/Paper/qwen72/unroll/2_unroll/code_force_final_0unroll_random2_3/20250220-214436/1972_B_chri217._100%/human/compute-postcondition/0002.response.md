The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `case`. `case` is a list where `case[0]` is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and `case[1]` is a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D" representing the state of each coin. The function returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in the string `s` is even; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `case` where the first element is an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It returns 'YES' if the number of "U" characters in `s` is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.**
