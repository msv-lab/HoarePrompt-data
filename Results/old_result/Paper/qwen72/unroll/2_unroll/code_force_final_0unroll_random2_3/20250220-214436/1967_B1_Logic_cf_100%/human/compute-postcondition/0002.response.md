Output State: **The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the values of `n` and `m` are updated based on the input provided. The variable `ans` is calculated for each pair of `n` and `m` and printed. After all iterations, the final state of `n` and `m` will be the values from the last input pair, and `ans` will be the last calculated value for that pair.**
