### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Reversal**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the integers `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists of integers `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`.
   - Both lists are reversed. This is a crucial step because it allows the function to process the elements from the end of the queue (where Kirill starts) to the front of the queue (where he wants to be).

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `soma_b` to 0 and `pref` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists. For each element:
     - If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, it adds `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref` and resets `soma_b` to 0.
     - Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - This part of the function is intended to calculate the cost of moving Kirill to the first `n - k` positions, where he can potentially find a cheaper position to bribe.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `resultado` to infinity.
   - It then iterates over the remaining elements (from `n - k` to `n - 1`) and calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` positions.
   - For each position `i` in this range, it updates `resultado` to the minimum of its current value and `pref + soma_b + lista_A[i]`.
   - It also adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b` for each iteration.
   - Finally, it prints `resultado`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `numero_testes` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - This ensures that the program processes multiple test cases as required by the problem statement.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes multiple test cases.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions is implemented correctly.
- The use of reversed lists ensures that the program considers the cost of moving Kirill from the end of the queue to the front, which is essential for the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program meets the problem description and handles the input and output as specified. The logic for calculating the minimum cost is correct and efficient.

### Correctness:
**True**
