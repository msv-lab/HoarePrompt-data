Output State: **The loop will process each test case and print the number of operations required to increment the median value of the array until it is no longer equal to the original median. If `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000, the loop will print 1 and 16668 and then break, stopping further processing of test cases. The variables `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, and `new_median` will be updated within the loop for each test case, but their final values will depend on the specific input for the last test case processed. The variable `num` will remain unchanged.**
