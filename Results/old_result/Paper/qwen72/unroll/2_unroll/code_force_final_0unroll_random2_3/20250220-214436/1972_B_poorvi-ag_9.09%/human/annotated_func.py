#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: n (an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and s (a string of length n containing only "U" and "D"). The function is expected to be called multiple times with different test cases, where the number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = input()
        
        if n % 2 == 0:
            results.append('no')
        elif arr.count('U') > arr.count('D'):
            results.append('yes')
        else:
            results.append('no')
        
    #State: The `results` list will contain `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated in each iteration of the loop. The values of `n` and `s` will be undefined or reset after each iteration, as they are re-assigned within the loop.
    for i in results:
        print(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list remains unchanged, containing `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no'. The values of `n` and `s` remain undefined or reset after each iteration, as they are re-assigned within the loop. The loop prints each element of the `results` list in sequence, but does not alter the list itself or any other variables outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". It then evaluates whether `n` is odd and if the count of "U" in `s` is greater than the count of "D". If both conditions are met, it appends 'yes' to a results list; otherwise, it appends 'no'. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in the results list. The function does not return any value.
