### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `nums`**:
   - The program initializes `nums` as a list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\). This list contains 21 elements, which is within the limit of 25 elements.

2. **Finding the Index `idx`**:
   - The program iterates through the `nums` list to find the largest index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}} \leq k\). This ensures that the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Modifying the `nums` List**:
   - The program removes the element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) from the `nums` list.
   - It then appends three new elements: \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the modified `nums` list, which is 23.
   - It then prints the elements of the modified `nums` list.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Condition 1: No subsequence with sum `k`**:
  - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and appending \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\), the program ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`. This is because:
    - The element \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and removing it breaks any potential subsequence that could sum to `k`.
    - The new elements \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) are chosen such that they cannot form a subsequence summing to `k` with the remaining elements.

- **Condition 2: All other sums `v` (1 ≤ v ≤ n, v ≠ k) are possible**:
  - The original list of powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{20}\) can represent any integer up to \(2^{21} - 1\) (which is much larger than \(10^6\)).
  - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and adding \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\), \(k + 1\), and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\), the program ensures that all integers from 1 to `n` (except `k`) can still be represented as a sum of a subsequence of `nums`.
  - The element \(k - 2^{\text{idx}}\) ensures that sums close to `k` can be formed.
  - The elements \(k + 1\) and \(k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1\) ensure that sums greater than `k` can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly modifies the list to ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing all other sums from 1 to `n` (except `k`) to be formed. The size of the modified list is 23, which is within the allowed limit of 25 elements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
