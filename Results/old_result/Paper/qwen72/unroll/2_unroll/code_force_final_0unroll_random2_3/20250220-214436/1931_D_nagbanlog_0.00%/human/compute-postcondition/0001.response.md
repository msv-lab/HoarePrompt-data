To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is not empty. The state of `t` and `results` are not directly relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements (n, x, y) and a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n).
- For each tuple, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, x and y are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and each a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
- The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
- `results` is an empty list.

We need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple for the loop to execute. The variable `case` will be the first tuple in `test_cases` when the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `case` is the first tuple in `test_cases`, `results` is an empty list**
