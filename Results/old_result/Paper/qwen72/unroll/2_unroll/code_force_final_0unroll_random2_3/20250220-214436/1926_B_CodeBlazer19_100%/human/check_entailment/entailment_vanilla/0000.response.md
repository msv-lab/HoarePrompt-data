Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the grid `n` for each test case. It then reads `n` lines of input for each test case, which is correct according to the problem description.

2. **Shape Detection**:
   - The program uses a variable `a` to detect if a row contains exactly one '1'. If such a row is found, it sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE'.
   - The program uses a variable `b` to detect if a row contains more than one '1'. If such a row is found, it sets `b` to 'SQUARE'.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all rows of the grid, the program checks if `a` is not zero. If `a` is set to 'TRIANGLE', it prints 'TRIANGLE'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'SQUARE'.

4. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly identify the shape based on the problem description. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should form a specific pattern (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...). The program only checks if a row has exactly one '1' and sets `a` to 'TRIANGLE' if it does. This is insufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle.
   - For a square, the program checks if any row has more than one '1' and sets `b` to 'SQUARE'. This is also insufficient because a square has a specific pattern where each row has the same number of '1's, and they are aligned.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify a triangle, the program should check if the number of '1's in each row forms a sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...).
   - To correctly identify a square, the program should check if each row has the same number of '1's and they are aligned.

Given these flaws, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
