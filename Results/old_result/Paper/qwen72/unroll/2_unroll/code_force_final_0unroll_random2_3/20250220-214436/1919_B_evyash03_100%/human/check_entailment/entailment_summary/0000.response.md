Reasoning:  
The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays. The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The goal is to minimize the total penalty.

The provided solution, `func_1`, calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`. This difference is then used to compute the penalty as the absolute value of this difference. However, this approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the penalty.

The optimal solution to minimize the penalty is to split the array `a` such that each subarray has a sum of zero. If the entire array `a` can be split into subarrays with a sum of zero, the total penalty will be zero. If it is not possible to split the array into subarrays with a sum of zero, the penalty will be the absolute value of the total sum of the array `a` multiplied by the length of the array.

The provided solution does not attempt to split the array into subarrays with a sum of zero. Instead, it calculates the total penalty based on the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
