Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step by step using the annotations and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Function 1: `func_1(row, d)`
- **Initial State:**
  - `row` is a list of non-negative integers where the first and last elements are 0, representing the depths of the river cells in a single row.
  - `d` is a positive integer such that 1 <= d <= len(row) - 1, representing the maximum distance between adjacent supports.

- **First Loop:**
  ```python
  for i in range(0, d - 1):
      row[i] = row[i] + 1
  ```
  - This loop increments the cost of the first `d-1` cells by 1. This is correct because the first support must be placed at the first column, and the next `d-1` cells are within the maximum distance `d` from the first support.

- **Second Loop:**
  ```python
  for i in range(d - 1, len(row)):
      row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1
  ```
  - This loop updates the cost of each cell from `row[d-1]` to `row[len(row)-1]` by adding the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells (including the incremented first `d-1` cells) plus the current value plus 1.
  - The logic here is intended to ensure that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`. However, it does not correctly handle the placement of supports. The `min` function is used to find the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells, but this does not guarantee that supports are placed at the correct intervals.

- **Return Statement:**
  ```python
  return row[-1]
  ```
  - The function returns the last element of the `row` list, which is the cost of placing a support in the last column. This is correct because the last support must be placed in the last column.

### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Initial State:**
  - The function reads input from the standard input. The first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 * 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m.
  - The next `n` lines each contain `m` integers representing the depths of the river cells, where `a_{i,1} = a_{i,m} = 0` for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.

- **Reading Input:**
  ```python
  n, m, k, d = (int(e) for e in input().split(' '))
  rows = [[int(e) for e in input().split(' ')] for _ in range(n)]
  ```
  - This correctly reads the input and stores it in the `rows` list.

- **Calculating Costs:**
  ```python
  costs = [func_1(row, d) for row in rows]
  ```
  - This calculates the cost of placing supports for each row using `func_1`.

- **Calculating Total Costs:**
  ```python
  total_costs = []
  for i in range(len(costs) - (k - 1)):
      total_costs.append(sum(costs[i:i + k]))
  ```
  - This calculates the total cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.

- **Output:**
  ```python
  print(min(total_costs))
  ```
  - This prints the minimum total cost of placing `k` consecutive bridges.

### Example Case Analysis
Consider the test case:
```
1
3 11 1 4
0 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 0
0 1 2 3 2 1 2 3 3 2 0
0 1 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 2 0
```
- **Row 1:**
  - Initial: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - After first loop: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]`
  - After second loop: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 0]`
  - Final cost: `0 + 1 = 1` (incorrect, should be `4`)

- **Row 2:**
  - Initial: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]`
  - After first loop: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 0]`
  - After second loop: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 0]`
  - Final cost: `0 + 1 = 1` (incorrect, should be `4`)

- **Row 3:**
  - Initial: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0]`
  - After first loop: `[1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 0]`
  - After second loop: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 3, 0]`
  - Final cost: `0 + 1 = 1` (incorrect, should be `4`)

### Conclusion
The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly handle the placement of supports according to the problem description. Specifically, the `min` function in the second loop of `func_1` does not ensure that supports are placed at the correct intervals, and the costs are calculated incorrectly.

Final: **False**
