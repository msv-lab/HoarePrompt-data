Output State: **For each test case, the output state is the index (1-based) of the position in the string `s` where the prefix up to that position and the suffix from that position onwards both have at least 50% of '0's and '1's, respectively. If no such position exists, the output is either 0 or n, depending on whether the entire string has at least 50% '1's or not.**
