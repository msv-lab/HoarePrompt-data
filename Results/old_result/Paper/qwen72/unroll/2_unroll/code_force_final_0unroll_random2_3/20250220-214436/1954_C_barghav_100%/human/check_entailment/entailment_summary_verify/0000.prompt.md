You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

Example

Input

    73
    
    31
    
    2
    
    5
    
    3516
    
    3982

Output

    71
    33
    5
    2
    3912
    3586

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    a = list(input())
    b = list(input())
    f = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if f == 0:
            if a[i] < b[i]:
                (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
                f = 1
            elif a[i] > b[i]:
                f = 1
        elif a[i] > b[i]:
            (a[i], b[i]) = (b[i], a[i])
    for i in range(len(a)):
        print(a[i], end='')
    print()
    for i in range(len(b)):
        print(b[i], end='')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads two lines of input, each expected to be a string of digits from 1 to 9 of the same length. The function ensures that the first differing digit between the two strings, if `a` is initially less than `b`, is swapped. After processing, it prints the modified strings `a` and `b` on separate lines, followed by a blank line. The function does not modify any external variables or handle multiple test cases as described in the comments.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not always maximize the product of \( x \) and \( y \). The logic in the program only swaps digits when it finds the first position where \( a[i] < b[i] \) and then continues to swap any subsequent digits where \( a[i] > b[i] \). This approach does not guarantee the maximum product.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1234
4321
```
The program will output:
```
4231
1324
```
However, the maximum product can be achieved by swapping all digits, resulting in:
```
4321
1234
```
The product of \( 4321 \times 1234 \) is greater than \( 4231 \times 1324 \).

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases to maximize the product.
