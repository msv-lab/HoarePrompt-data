The function `min_islands_visitable` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer representing the number of islands, with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. `k` is an integer representing the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed, with a constraint of 0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2. The function returns the minimum number of islands that can still be visited after destroying up to `k` bridges.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of islands (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `k` is the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed (0 ≤ k ≤ n(n - 1)/2). It returns the minimum number of islands that can still be visited after destroying up to `k` bridges.**
