Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **String Conversion and Counting Zeroes**: The string `s` is converted to a list of integers, and the number of zeroes in the string is counted using `s.count(0)`.

3. **Initialization**: Two counters `cnt` are initialized to keep track of the number of 0s and 1s encountered so far, and `ans` is initialized to 0 to store the total cost.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`, the program updates the count of `c` in `cnt`.
   - If the character `c` is 0 and there has been at least one 1 encountered (`cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a shift is needed to move this 0 to its correct position.
   - If the character `c` is 1, it adds the number of remaining zeroes (`zeroes - cnt[0]`) to `ans` because each 1 needs to be shifted past all remaining zeroes to be in the correct position.

5. **Output**: The program prints the total cost `ans` for each test case.

This approach ensures that the minimum cost is calculated correctly for each test case by considering the positions of 0s and 1s and the necessary shifts to sort the string. The logic aligns with the problem's requirements and constraints, making the program correct.
