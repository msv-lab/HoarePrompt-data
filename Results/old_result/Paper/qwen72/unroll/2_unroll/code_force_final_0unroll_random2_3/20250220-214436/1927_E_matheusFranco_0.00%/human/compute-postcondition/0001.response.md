The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 10^4, inclusive. Since the minimum value of `t` is 1, the loop will certainly execute at least once.

State: **`t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 10^4, inclusive**
