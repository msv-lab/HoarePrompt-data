Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The logic in the given program is incorrect for determining the winner of the game. The program attempts to find the "mex" (minimum excludant) value, which is the smallest positive integer not present in the list of pile sizes. However, this approach does not correctly model the game's rules.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Odd and Even Piles:**
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is odd, Alice wins.
   - If the number of piles with an odd number of stones is even, Bob wins.

This is because:
- Alice and Bob can always choose the smallest nonempty pile size, which will be 1 if there are any odd-sized piles.
- Removing 1 stone from each nonempty pile will change the parity (odd/even) of the number of stones in each pile.
- The game will continue until all piles are empty, and the player who is forced to make the last move (when all piles are empty) loses.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        odd_count = sum(1 for sz in a if sz % 2 == 1)
        print('Alice' if odd_count % 2 == 1 else 'Bob')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `a`.
- It counts the number of piles with an odd number of stones using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
- It then prints "Alice" if the count of odd-sized piles is odd, and "Bob" otherwise.

This approach correctly determines the winner based on the game's rules.
