Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    4 1

    6 2
    
    1 3 4 9 1 3
    
    7 6 8 10 6 8

Output

    1
    1
    0
    7
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
import heapq
import sys

read_input = sys.stdin.readline
func_4()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(read_input())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value input by the user. After the function concludes, the program state includes a returned integer that represents the user's input.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, read_input().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads a space-separated string from the standard input, converts each part of the string into an integer, and returns a map object containing these integers. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. After the function concludes, the user will have a map object that can be iterated over to access the integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(primary_items, secondary_heap):
    total = sum((item[0] for item in secondary_heap))
    for item in primary_items:
        if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
            total += item[0] + item[1]
    return total
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `primary_items`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing the prices of an item for Alice and Bob respectively, and `secondary_heap`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains one integer representing the price of an item for Bob. The function returns the total sum of prices for Bob from `secondary_heap` and the sum of prices for both Alice and Bob from `primary_items`, but only includes items where the sum of the prices for each item is non-negative.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        heap = []
        remaining_items = []
        (n, k) = func_2()
        prices = list(func_2())
        neg_prices = [-price for price in prices]
        bonuses = list(func_2())
        max_profit = 0
        current_profit = 0
        combined = list(zip(neg_prices, bonuses))
        combined.sort(key=lambda item: item[1])
        for _ in range(k):
            if combined:
                heapq.heappush(heap, combined.pop())
        if combined:
            current_profit = func_3(combined, heap)
        if current_profit > max_profit:
            max_profit = current_profit
        while combined:
            item = combined.pop()
            if item[0] + item[1] >= 0:
                current_profit -= item[1]
            else:
                current_profit += item[0]
            removed_item = heapq.heappushpop(heap, item)
            if removed_item:
                current_profit -= removed_item[0]
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
        print(max_profit)
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function `func_4` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it receives two integers `n` and `k`, and two lists `prices` and `bonuses` of length `n`. It calculates the maximum profit that can be achieved by selecting up to `k` items, where the profit of each item is determined by its price and bonus. The function prints the maximum profit for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the internal variables are reset for each test case.
