The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It returns a list `cases` which contains `t` tuples. Each tuple in the list consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". The value of `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, indicating the number of tuples in the list.

Functionality: **The function returns a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of "U" and "D".**
