The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `n` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input. The function calculates the minimum number of 15-minute intervals (`t`) required such that `t * 15 >= a + b * 4` and prints this value for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `t` for each test case are not retained.
