The function `func` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. These parameters represent the number of non-negative integers to be printed and their sum, respectively. The function returns a list of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, and returns a list of `n` non-negative integers that sum up to `k`.**
