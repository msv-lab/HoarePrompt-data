Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Incorrect Inner Loop Initialization**:
   - The inner loop for `j` starts from 4 instead of 1. This means the program will miss valid pairs where `b` is less than 4.
   - The correct initialization should be `for j in range(1, b + 1):`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of valid pairs is flawed. The formula `x = (a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1` does not correctly determine the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The correct approach should involve checking each pair `(a, b)` to see if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied.

3. **Incorrect Final Sum Calculation**:
   - The program subtracts 1 from the final sum `suma` without a clear reason. This is likely incorrect and should be removed.

### Correct Approach:

To solve the problem correctly, you need to iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    T = int(input())
    for t in range(T):
        info = input().split()
        (n, m) = (int(info[0]), int(info[1]))
        suma = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for j in range(1, m + 1):
                if (i + j) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0:
                    suma += 1
        print(suma)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`.

2. **Pair Checking**:
   - The program iterates over all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i <= n` and `1 <= j <= m`.
   - For each pair, it checks if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the condition `(i + j) % (j * math.gcd(i, j)) == 0`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count `suma`.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, it prints the count of valid pairs.

This corrected program should work correctly for the given problem description.
