Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads a list of 2n integers, sorts them in ascending order, and then iteratively pairs the integers, summing the smaller of each pair. The function prints the sum for each test case. The function does not return any value and does not modify the input parameters `t`, `n`, or `a`. After the function concludes, the input parameters remain unchanged, and the sums of the minimum pairs for each test case have been printed. **
