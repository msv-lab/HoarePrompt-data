Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is 12 and the time is in the AM part of the day correctly. According to the problem description, "00:00" should be "12:00 AM", but the program would output "12:00 AM" for "12:00" as well, which should be "12:00 PM". This is a specific edge case that the program fails to handle correctly.
