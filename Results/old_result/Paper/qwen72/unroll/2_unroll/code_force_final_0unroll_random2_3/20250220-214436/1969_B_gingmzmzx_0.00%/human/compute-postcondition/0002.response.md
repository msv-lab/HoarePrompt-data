Output State: **The loop will execute `n` times, and for each iteration, it will read a new binary string `s` from the input, convert it to a list of integers, and compute the value of `ans` based on the number of zeroes and ones in the list. The final value of `ans` for each iteration will be printed. The variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` will be reset to their initial states at the beginning of each iteration.**
