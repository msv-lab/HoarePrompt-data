The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. Since `n` is already defined to be in the range 2 to 50, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, and `a` is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i <= 99, `_` is a placeholder variable**
