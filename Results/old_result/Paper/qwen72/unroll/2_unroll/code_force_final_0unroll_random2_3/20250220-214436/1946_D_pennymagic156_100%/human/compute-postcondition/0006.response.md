The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters. It returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the list `a`. Since `a` is an empty list, its length is 0. `ans` is the maximum count of integers in `a` that have the same bit set at the highest position where `x` has a 0 bit, and the sum of the bits at that position in `a` is even. However, because `a` is empty, `ans` must be 0. Therefore, the function returns 0.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns 0.**
