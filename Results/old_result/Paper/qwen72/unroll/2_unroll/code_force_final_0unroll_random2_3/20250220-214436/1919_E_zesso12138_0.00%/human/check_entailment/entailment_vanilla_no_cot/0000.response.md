Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in `func_1`. The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is not correctly accounting for the constraints and the nature of the problem. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the sorted prefix sums and the constraints on the values of `p`.

Here are the issues:

1. **Dynamic Programming State**: The `dp` array is initialized to handle a range of sums from `-n` to `n`, but the program does not correctly update the `dp` array to reflect the possible prefix sums that can be formed by the array `a`.

2. **Final Sum Calculation**: The final sum is calculated as `p[-1] + offset`, but this does not correctly account for the fact that the prefix sums are sorted and must be non-decreasing.

3. **Transition Logic**: The transition logic in the dynamic programming loop is not correctly handling the constraints that the prefix sums must be non-decreasing and that the elements of `a` can only be `1` or `-1`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to ensure that the prefix sums are non-decreasing and that the elements of `a` can only be `1` or `-1`. The correct approach involves checking the feasibility of the prefix sums and then using combinatorial methods to count the number of valid arrays `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
MOD = 998244353

def count_arrays(n, p):
    # Check if the prefix sums are valid
    if p[0] != 0 or p[-1] > n or p[-1] < -n:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the number of 1s and -1s needed
    ones = 0
    minus_ones = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0:
            ones += p[i]
            minus_ones += -p[i]
        else:
            ones += p[i] - p[i-1]
            minus_ones += -p[i] + p[i-1]
    
    # Check if the counts are valid
    if ones < 0 or minus_ones < 0 or ones + minus_ones != n:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the number of valid arrays using combinatorics
    from math import comb
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if p[i] == p[i-1]:
            result = (result * (ones + minus_ones - i + 1)) % MOD
        else:
            result = (result * comb(ones + minus_ones - i + 1, ones + p[i] - p[i-1])) % MOD
    
    return result

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = count_arrays(n, p)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Validation of Prefix Sums**: The program first checks if the prefix sums are valid. Specifically, it checks if the first element of `p` is `0` (since the prefix sum of an empty array is `0`), and if the last element of `p` is within the valid range `[-n, n]`.

2. **Counting 1s and -1s**: The program calculates the number of `1`s and `-1`s needed to form the prefix sums. This is done by iterating through the prefix sums and adjusting the counts accordingly.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The program uses combinatorial methods to count the number of valid arrays `a`. The key idea is to use the binomial coefficient to count the number of ways to place `1`s and `-1`s to achieve the given prefix sums.

4. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: The `func_2` function reads the input and processes multiple test cases, calling `count_arrays` for each test case and storing the results.

This corrected program should handle the problem as described and produce the correct output for the given test cases.
