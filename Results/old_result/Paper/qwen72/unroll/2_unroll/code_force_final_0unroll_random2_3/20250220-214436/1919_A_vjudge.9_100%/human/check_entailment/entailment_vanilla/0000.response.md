### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics:**
   - The game is turn-based, with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then they must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin from a wallet with 0 coins) loses.

2. **Optimal Play Analysis:**
   - If both wallets have the same number of coins, the game is symmetric. Each player can mirror the other's moves, ensuring that the game will end in a draw if both wallets are empty at the same time. However, since the game is turn-based and Alice starts first, Bob will always be the one to make the last move and win.
   - If the wallets have a different number of coins, the player with the wallet that has more coins can always force the game into a state where the number of coins in both wallets is the same, but with the opponent's turn. This is because the player can always swap wallets to ensure they have the wallet with more coins and then remove a coin, making the number of coins in both wallets equal but with the opponent's turn. This forces the opponent into a losing position.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - The key insight is that the game is determined by the parity (odd or even) of the difference in the number of coins between the two wallets.
   - If the difference \( |a - b| \) is even, Bob will always win because the game will end in a symmetric state with Bob's turn.
   - If the difference \( |a - b| \) is odd, Alice will always win because she can force the game into a symmetric state with Bob's turn, and Bob will be the one to make the last move.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( a \) and \( b \) in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - It checks if the absolute difference \( |a - b| \) is even or odd.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the difference \( |a - b| \).
   - The logic matches the optimal play strategy described above.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
