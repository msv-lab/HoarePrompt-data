Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the price increase for subsequent days when tickets are purchased. According to the problem description, if a person purchases `x` tickets on day `i`, the prices for all subsequent days (i.e., from day `i+1` onwards) should increase by `x`. However, the program does not implement this logic. Instead, it simply sorts the prices and buys tickets in the order of the lowest prices, which does not account for the price increase after each purchase.

Here is a specific test case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 100 1
10000 1 100 10 1000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will output a different value because it does not account for the price increase after purchasing tickets on the first day.

In the given example, the optimal way to buy 1 ticket is to buy it on the second day when the price is 1. However, the program will sort the prices and buy the ticket on the day with the lowest price, which is the second day, but it will not correctly handle the price increase for subsequent days. This can lead to incorrect results in cases where the price increase significantly affects the total cost.
