Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case for any valid input \( n \) (1 ≤ n ≤ 20). Instead, it only handles specific cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any other value of \( n \), it prints "No esta en el rango" which is not the expected output according to the problem statement.

To make the program correct, it should generate the checkerboard for any \( n \) within the specified range using a more general approach. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(2 * n):
            for j in range(2 * n):
                if (i // 2 + j // 2) % 2 == 0:
                    print('#', end='')
                else:
                    print('.', end='')
            print()
```

This version of the program correctly generates the checkerboard for any valid \( n \) by using nested loops to determine the pattern of `#` and `.` based on the row and column indices.
