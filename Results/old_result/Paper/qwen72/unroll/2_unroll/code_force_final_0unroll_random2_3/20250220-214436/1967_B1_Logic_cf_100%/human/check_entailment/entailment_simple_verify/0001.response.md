### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` and converts them to integers.

2. **Initial Answer**:
   - The program initializes the answer `ans` to `n`. This is because for any `b = 1`, the condition \(a + b\) is always a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) (since \(\gcd(a, 1) = 1\) and \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of 1). This part is correct.

3. **Loop for Valid Pairs**:
   - The program then iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
   - For each `b`, it calculates \((n + b) // (b * b)\) and adds this value to `ans`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not directly checked in the loop.
   - Instead, the program uses \((n + b) // (b * b)\) to count the number of valid pairs. This expression is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Correct Condition**:
   - The correct condition to check is whether \((a + b) \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The program should iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` and count the pairs that satisfy this condition. However, the current implementation does not do this.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The current approach is inefficient and incorrect because it does not correctly handle the condition and may lead to incorrect results.

### Annotated Code Analysis:

- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\).

- **State after reading `t`**:
  - `t` is the number of test cases, and the program correctly iterates over each test case.

- **State after reading `n` and `m` for each test case**:
  - `n` and `m` are updated for each test case, and the program correctly converts them to integers.

- **State after initializing `ans`**:
  - `ans` is initialized to `n`, which is correct for the initial condition where `b = 1`.

- **State during the loop for `b`**:
  - The loop iterates from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`.
  - The expression \((n + b) // (b * b)\) is used to update `ans`. This expression is incorrect because it does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- **State after the loop**:
  - The final value of `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The logic used in the loop is flawed and does not count the valid pairs correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
