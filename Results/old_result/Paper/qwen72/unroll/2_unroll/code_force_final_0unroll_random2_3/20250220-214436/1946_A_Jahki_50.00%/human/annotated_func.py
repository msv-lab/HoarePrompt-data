#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is intended to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        
        case = input()
        
        op = 0
        
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)
        
    #State: The loop will process each test case and print the number of operations required to increment the median value of the array until it is no longer equal to the original median. If `num2` (the length of the array) is greater than 10000, the loop will print 1 and 16668 and then break, stopping further processing of test cases. The variables `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, and `new_median` will be updated within the loop for each test case, but their final values will depend on the specific input for the last test case processed. The variable `num` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. If `n` is greater than 10000, the function prints 1 and 16668 and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it calculates the number of operations required to increment the median value of the array `a` until it is no longer equal to the original median, and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The variables used within the function are updated for each test case, but their final values depend on the specific input of the last test case processed. The variable `num` (the total number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.
