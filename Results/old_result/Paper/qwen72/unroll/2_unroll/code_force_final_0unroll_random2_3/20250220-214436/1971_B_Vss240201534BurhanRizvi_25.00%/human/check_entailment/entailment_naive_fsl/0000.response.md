Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the string `s` consists of the same character repeated multiple times, and the length of the string is greater than 1. For example, if the input string is "aa", the program might generate the same string "aa" after shuffling, leading to an incorrect output of "No" instead of "Yes" with a valid rearranged string.

A correct approach would be to check if the string has more than one distinct character before attempting to shuffle it. If the string has only one distinct character and its length is greater than 1, then it is impossible to rearrange it to a different string, and the program should output "NO". Otherwise, it should output "YES" and a valid rearranged string.
