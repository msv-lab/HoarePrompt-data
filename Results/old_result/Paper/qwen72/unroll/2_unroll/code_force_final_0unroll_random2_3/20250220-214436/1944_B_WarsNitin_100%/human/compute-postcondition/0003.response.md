The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `a`, and `k`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000.
- `a` is a list of integers of length 2n, containing each integer from 1 to n exactly twice.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ ⌊n/2⌋.

For each test case, the function finds two subsets `l` and `r` of length 2k from the first half and the second half of `a`, respectively, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in `l` is equal to the bitwise XOR of the elements in `r`.

Cases:
1. If such subsets `l` and `r` are found, the function returns a tuple `(l, r)`.
2. If no such subsets are found, the function returns `None`.
