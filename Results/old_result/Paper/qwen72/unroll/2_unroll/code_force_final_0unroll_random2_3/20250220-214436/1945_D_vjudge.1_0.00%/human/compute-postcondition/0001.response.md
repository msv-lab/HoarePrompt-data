To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head involves the variable `numero_testes` and the loop variable `_`.

1. **`_`**: This is a common Python convention for a variable that is not going to be used within the loop. It is automatically incremented by the `range` function, so we do not need to adjust it manually.

2. **`numero_testes`**: The loop will execute if `numero_testes` is greater than 0. Given the state before the loop, `numero_testes` is an input integer with the constraint 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. This constraint already ensures that `numero_testes` is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts is already sufficient to ensure the loop will execute. However, to clearly state the necessary conditions for the loop to execute, we can rephrase it as follows:

State: **`numero_testes` is an input integer, 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4, ensuring `numero_testes` is greater than 0.**
