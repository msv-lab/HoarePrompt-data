### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find pairs of indices \((i, j)\) such that \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and the following conditions are met:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\).
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\) where:
     - \(\text{mod}_x = a_i \mod x\)
     - \(\text{mod}_y = a_i \mod y\)
   - For each number \(a_i\) in the array, it calculates:
     - \(\text{mod}_x = a_i \mod x\)
     - \(\text{mod}_y = a_i \mod y\)
     - \(\text{required_mod}_x = (x - \text{mod}_x) \mod x\)
     - \(\text{required_mod}_y = \text{mod}_y\)
   - It then checks if the pair \((\text{required_mod}_x, \text{required_mod}_y)\) exists in the `freq` dictionary. If it does, it adds the frequency of this pair to `beautiful_count`.
   - Finally, it updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair \((\text{mod}_x, \text{mod}_y)\).

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Condition 1: \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\):**
     - This condition is satisfied if \((a_i \mod x + a_j \mod x) \mod x = 0\).
     - The program calculates \(\text{required_mod}_x = (x - \text{mod}_x) \mod x\), which is the value that \(a_j \mod x\) must be for the sum to be divisible by \(x\).
   - **Condition 2: \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\):**
     - This condition is satisfied if \((a_i \mod y - a_j \mod y) \mod y = 0\).
     - The program calculates \(\text{required_mod}_y = \text{mod}_y\), which is the value that \(a_j \mod y\) must be for the difference to be divisible by \(y\).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by iterating over `test_cases`.
   - The program correctly initializes the `freq` dictionary for each test case.
   - The program correctly updates the `freq` dictionary and counts the beautiful pairs.

5. **Time Complexity:**
   - The program iterates over the array once for each test case, making it \(O(n)\) per test case.
   - Since the sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), the overall time complexity is efficient.

6. **Output:**
   - The program correctly appends the result for each test case to the `results` list and returns it.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The reasoning and implementation are sound, and the program should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

**Correctness: True**
