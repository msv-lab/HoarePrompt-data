You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State: For each test case, the variable `c` will contain the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets, and `k` will be 0 after the loop has executed all iterations. The values of `n`, `m`, and `l` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. Each test case involves buying a specified number of tickets (`k`) over a given number of days (`n`), with a limit on the number of tickets that can be bought each day (`m`). The function reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list of ticket prices for each day (`a`). It calculates and prints the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets by sorting the ticket prices and buying the cheapest available tickets first, up to the daily limit. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the minimum total cost for each test case. The input variables `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged after each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the cheapest tickets are purchased first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes variables `t`, `s`, and `c` to 0. 
     - `t` keeps track of the total number of tickets purchased so far.
     - `s` determines the number of tickets to purchase on the current day.
     - `c` accumulates the total cost of the tickets.

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices.
   - For each day, it determines the number of tickets to purchase (`s`) as the minimum of `m` (the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day) and `k` (the remaining number of tickets needed).
   - It then calculates the cost of purchasing `s` tickets on the current day, taking into account the increase in price due to previous purchases (`t`).
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of the current day's purchases.
   - The total number of tickets purchased `t` is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased on the current day.
   - The remaining number of tickets needed `k` is decreased by the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the program prints the total cost `c` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the Approach:**
  - The program's approach is to always buy the cheapest available tickets first, which is a greedy strategy. This is correct because buying cheaper tickets first will minimize the total cost.
  - The program correctly handles the price increase for subsequent days by adding the number of tickets purchased so far to the price of the current day's tickets.
  - The program ensures that it does not exceed the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`).
  - The program also ensures that it does not purchase more tickets than needed (`k`).

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is less than or equal to `m` by purchasing all remaining tickets on the first day.
  - The program handles the case where `k` is greater than `m` by purchasing `m` tickets on each day until `k` tickets are purchased.

- **Performance:**
  - The program sorts the list of ticket prices, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
  - The loop that purchases tickets runs in \(O(n)\) time.
  - The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) per test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
