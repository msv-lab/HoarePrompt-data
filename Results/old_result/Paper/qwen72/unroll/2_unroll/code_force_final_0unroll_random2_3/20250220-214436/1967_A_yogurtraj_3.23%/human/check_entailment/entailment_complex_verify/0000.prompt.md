You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State: For each test case, the loop calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by using the available coins. The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` are not directly modified by the loop, but the loop processes each test case and prints the result. After all iterations of the loop, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain as they were initially, but the loop has printed the results for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by the number of distinct types of cards `n`, the number of coins available `k`, and a list `a` representing the initial number of cards of each type. For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum number of cards that can be made equal by using the available coins. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, and the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain as they were initially, but the results for each test case have been printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of coins \( k \) is sufficient to make all the counts of cards equal to the maximum count. In such a case, the program should be able to form the maximum number of contiguous subarrays of length \( n \) that are permutations of \([1, 2, \ldots, n]\). However, the current implementation may not correctly calculate the final score in this scenario.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 10
1 2 3
```
The program should be able to buy cards to make the counts of all card types equal to 4, resulting in the array:
```
[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]
```
This array can form 2 permutations of \([1, 2, 3]\) (i.e., \([1, 2, 3]\) and \([3, 1, 2]\)), but the program does not correctly compute this.

The issue lies in the logic where the program calculates the final score. Specifically, the calculation of `rem` and `y` and how they are used in the final score calculation may not be correct for all cases.
