The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` should start at 0, as it is the initial value for the loop index.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
