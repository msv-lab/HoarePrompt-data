### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(xa, ya)` and `(xb, yb)` respectively.

2. **Initial Condition Check**:
   - If `xa > xb`, Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip, and neither can move into the other's position. Therefore, the game ends in a draw.
   - This condition is correctly handled by the program.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the vertical distance between Alice's and Bob's chips as `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`.
   - This is the number of turns it will take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet on the same row.

4. **Odd Distance Case**:
   - If the vertical distance `abs(xa - xb)` is odd, the program calculates the possible range of columns where Alice can move her chip to meet Bob.
   - `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)` define the leftmost and rightmost columns where Alice can move her chip.
   - The program then checks if Alice can move her chip to a position within this range in the next turn (i.e., `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1` and `abs(r - ya) <= x + 1`).
   - If Alice can move her chip to a position within this range, she wins. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.
   - This logic is correct for the odd distance case.

5. **Even Distance Case**:
   - If the vertical distance `abs(xa - xb)` is even, the program calculates the possible range of columns where Bob can move his chip to meet Alice.
   - `l = max(1, ya - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)` define the leftmost and rightmost columns where Bob can move his chip.
   - The program then checks if Bob can move his chip to a position within this range in the next turn (i.e., `abs(l - yb) <= x` and `abs(r - yb) <= x`).
   - If Bob can move his chip to a position within this range, he wins. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.
   - This logic is correct for the even distance case.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which can be "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw".
   - The output format is correct and matches the problem description.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the conditions and logic described in the problem. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
