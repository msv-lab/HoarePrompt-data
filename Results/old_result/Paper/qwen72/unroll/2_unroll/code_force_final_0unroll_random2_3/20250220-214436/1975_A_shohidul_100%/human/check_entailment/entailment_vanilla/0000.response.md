### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
   - The program first checks if the array `a` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the `all` function with a list comprehension.
   - If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

3. **Finding the First Out-of-Order Element:**
   - If the array is not sorted, the program iterates through the array to find the first position `i` where `a[i - 1] > a[i]`.

4. **Checking the Split and Swap Condition:**
   - Once it finds the first out-of-order element, it splits the array into two parts: `a[:i]` and `a[i:]`.
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - All elements in the suffix `a[i:]` should be less than or equal to the first element of the prefix `a[0]`.
     - The suffix `a[i:]` should be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If either condition fails, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Split and Swap:**
  - The program only checks the first out-of-order element and its immediate suffix. However, the problem requires checking if there is any valid split that can make the array sorted.
  - The program should continue checking all possible splits, not just the first one.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, the program should iterate through all possible splits and check if any of them can make the array sorted.

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the array is already sorted
        if all(a[i - 1] <= a[i] for i in range(1, n)):
            print('YES')
            continue
        
        # Check all possible splits
        found = False
        for i in range(1, n):
            new = a[i:] + a[:i]
            if all(new[i - 1] <= new[i] for i in range(1, n)):
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Initial Check for Sorted Array:**
  - The program first checks if the array is already sorted using the `all` function.
  - If the array is sorted, it prints 'YES' and moves to the next test case.

- **Checking All Possible Splits:**
  - The program iterates through all possible split points `i` from 1 to `n-1`.
  - For each split point, it creates a new array `new` by concatenating the suffix `a[i:]` and the prefix `a[:i]`.
  - It then checks if the new array `new` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - If any split results in a sorted array, it sets `found` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
  - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `found` is `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** because it only checks the first out-of-order element and its immediate suffix, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be sorted by any valid split.
- The corrected program is **correct** as it checks all possible splits and ensures that the array can be sorted by any valid operation.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
