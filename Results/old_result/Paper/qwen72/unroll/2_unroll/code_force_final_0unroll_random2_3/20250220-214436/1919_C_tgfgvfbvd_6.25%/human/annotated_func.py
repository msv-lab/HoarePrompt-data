#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the size of the array a, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = l[0]
        
        b = 0
        
        c = 0
        
        y = 0
        
        for y in range(1, n):
            if l[y] > l[y - 1]:
                b = l[y]
                break
        
        for x in range(y + 1, n):
            if l[x] > a and l[x] > b:
                if l[x] - a >= l[x] - b:
                    a = l[x]
                else:
                    b = l[x]
                c += 1
            elif l[x] < a and l[x] < b:
                if a - l[x] <= b - l[x]:
                    a = l[x]
                else:
                    b = l[x]
            elif a >= l[x]:
                a = l[x]
            else:
                b = l[x]
        
        print(c)
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `t` (number of test cases) is unchanged, and for each test case, the variables `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `y` will have their final values as determined by the logic of the loop. Specifically, `n` will be the size of the array for the last test case, `l` will be the list of integers for the last test case, `a` and `b` will be the last two elements that were compared in the loop, `c` will be the count of elements that satisfied the condition `l[x] > a and l[x] > b` and were processed accordingly, and `y` will be the index of the last element that was greater than its previous element in the first loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it identifies two elements `a` and `b` from the list and counts the number of elements that satisfy certain conditions relative to `a` and `b`. Specifically, it increments a counter `c` for elements that are greater than both `a` and `b` and are processed according to the specified logic. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of `c` for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The state of the program after the function concludes includes the unchanged number of test cases `t`, and the final values of `n`, `l`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `y` for the last test case.
