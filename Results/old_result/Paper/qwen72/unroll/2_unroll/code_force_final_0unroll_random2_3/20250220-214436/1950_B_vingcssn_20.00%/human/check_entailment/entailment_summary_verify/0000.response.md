Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The program `func` only explicitly handles the cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \). For any \( n \) outside of these values, the program prints "No esta en el rango" instead of generating the correct checkerboard pattern. According to the problem description, the program should handle any \( n \) in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \). Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect for any \( n \) greater than 4. For example, if \( n = 5 \), the program will not produce the correct checkerboard pattern, which should be a 10x10 board with the specified alternating pattern.

Final: **False**
