You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length `n` with each cell containing either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball placed on the i-th cell will move left or right based on the character in that cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after the pinball moves.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.
   - We need to answer `n` queries, each starting with a pinball on the i-th cell, and output the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is a helper function that calculates the difference between the last element in the array and the element at a specific index after applying the `max` function to ensure the index is within bounds.
   - `func_2` is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time for each query.

3. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters.
     - `preOne` is the cumulative sum of indices where the character is '>', initialized with an extra 0 at the beginning.
     - `suffZero` is a list initialized with 0, which will store cumulative sums of indices where the character is '<'.
     - `ans` is a list of size `n` initialized with 0, which will store the results for each query.

   - **Loop through the grid in reverse:**
     - For each cell `i` from `n-1` to `0`:
       - If the character is '>', it means the pinball will move to the right.
         - The program calculates the number of '>' and '<' characters to the right of the current cell.
         - It uses `func_1` to get the cumulative sums and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
         - It updates `preOne` and `totalOne` to reflect the removal of the current cell from the list of '>' characters.
       - If the character is '<', it means the pinball will move to the left.
         - The program updates `suffZero` with the cumulative sum of the current index.
         - It calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid using the cumulative sums and the number of '>' and '<' characters.
         - It updates `ans` with the calculated time.

   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the results for each query.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the characters.
   - The use of cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) helps in efficiently calculating the time for each query.
   - The logic for handling the different cases (pinball moving left or right) is implemented correctly.
   - The program ensures that the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It efficiently calculates the time for each pinball to leave the grid using cumulative sums and handles the inversion of characters correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
