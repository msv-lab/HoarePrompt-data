The code `a = list(input())` reads a line of input from the user and converts it into a list of characters. The initial state specifies that the function should take two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. After executing the code, the variable `a` will hold a list of characters from the input string.

Output State: **The function should take two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are integers consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and both have the same length. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. `a` is a list of characters from the input string.**
