The function `func` is not properly defined for the problem. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases, the number of participants, the number of screenshots, and the screenshots themselves. For example, it should be defined as `def func(t, n, k, screenshots):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `screenshots` is a list of lists, each containing `n` integers representing the order of participants shown to the participant who posted the screenshot.
