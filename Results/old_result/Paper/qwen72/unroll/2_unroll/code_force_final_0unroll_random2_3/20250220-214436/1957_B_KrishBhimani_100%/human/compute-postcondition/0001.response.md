Output State: **The loop will print a sequence of non-negative integers for each test case. For each test case, if n is 1, it will print k. Otherwise, it will print a sequence of n integers where the first integer is the largest power of 2 less than k, the second integer is the difference between k and the first integer, and the remaining n-2 integers are 0.**
