You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        nums = [1 << i for i in range(21)]
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        nums.append(k + 1)
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        print(len(nums))
        print(*nums)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        nums = [(1 << i) for i in range(21)]
        
        idx = -1
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] > k:
                idx = i - 1
                break
        
        nums.append(k - nums[idx])
        
        nums.append(k + 1)
        
        nums.append(k + nums[idx] + 1)
        
        nums.remove(1 << idx)
        
        print(len(nums))
        
        print(*nums)
        
    #State: For each test case, the loop outputs the length of the modified `nums` list, followed by the elements of the modified `nums` list. The modified `nums` list will have 23 elements, which are the original powers of 2 up to 2^20, with the element 2^idx removed, and the elements (k - 2^idx), (k + 1), and (k + 2^idx + 1) appended. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. For each test case, the function modifies a list of powers of 2 (from 2^0 to 2^20) by removing the element 2^idx (where idx is the largest index such that 2^idx <= k) and appending the elements (k - 2^idx), (k + 1), and (k + 2^idx + 1). The function then prints the length of the modified list and the elements of the modified list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is equal to `k`. According to the problem description, the sequence should not have any subsequence that sums to `k`, but for all other values `v` (where `1 ≤ v ≤ n` and `v ≠ k`), there should be a subsequence that sums to `v`. However, the program adds `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the sequence, which can lead to a subsequence that sums to `k` in certain cases.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
8 8
```
The program will generate the sequence:
```
22
1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192 16384 32768 65536 131072 262144 524288 1048576 9 17
```
This sequence does not meet the problem's requirements because it contains elements that can sum to `k` (e.g., `9 + 16 + 17 = 42`, and `8 + 1 = 9`), which is not allowed. Additionally, the sequence is much larger than the required size of at most 25.

The program also does not ensure that for all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence that sums to `v`. For instance, in the above example, there is no subsequence that sums to `7` or `15`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
