Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` where `1 â‰¤ x < 2^30`. This part is correctly implemented.

2. **Binary Representation**: The function initializes a list `s` to store the binary representation of `x` with a fixed length of 30. It correctly appends '1' or '0' based on whether the corresponding bit in `x` is set. This is a correct approach to generate the binary representation of `x`.

3. **Modification of Binary Representation**:
   - The function iterates through the binary representation to ensure that no two consecutive bits are both '1'. If it finds such a pair, it changes the first bit to '-1' and sets a flag to indicate that the next bit should be adjusted.
   - The flag is used to propagate the carry through the binary string. If the flag is set and the current bit is '0', the bit is changed to '1', and the flag is reset.
   - If the flag is set and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'. If the flag is still set after processing all bits, it appends an additional '1' to the list and increments the length.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the initial modification, the function makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive bits are both '1' or '-1'. If it finds a '-1' followed by a '1', it changes the '1' to '0' and the '-1' to '-1'.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the modified binary string and the modified binary string itself. This is the correct format for the output.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `x` is a power of 2 correctly by appending an additional '1' if necessary.
   - The function also handles the case where `x` is 1 correctly by printing the length as 1 and the array as [1].

7. **Constraints**:
   - The function ensures that the length of the array `s` is between 1 and 32, which is within the problem constraints.
   - The function ensures that each element in `s` is either '1', '0', or '-1', which is also within the problem constraints.
   - The function ensures that there are no two consecutive non-zero elements in `s`, which is a key requirement of the problem.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
