### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries to compare \( (p_a \mid p_b) \) with \( (p_c \mid p_d) \).

2. **Initial Strategy:**
   - The program starts by finding the index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - This is done by comparing \( p_0 \) with each \( p_i \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( ? \, v1 \, v1 \, i \, i \).
   - If \( p_{v1} \mid p_{v1} < p_i \mid p_i \), then \( p_{v1} < p_i \), and \( v1 \) is updated to \( i \).

3. **Finding the Second Index:**
   - Once \( v1 \) is determined, the program then finds the index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \) maximizes \( p_{v1} \oplus p_{prev} \).
   - This is done by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \) for \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( ? \, v1 \, i \, v1 \, prev \).
   - If \( p_{v1} \mid p_i > p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \), then \( prev \) is updated to \( i \).

4. **Output the Result:**
   - After finding \( prev \) and \( v1 \), the program outputs \( ! \, prev \, v1 \) as the indices that maximize \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

5. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( v1 \).
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries to find \( prev \).
   - The total number of queries is \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

6. **Correctness of the Strategy:**
   - The strategy ensures that \( v1 \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation.
   - The second loop ensures that \( prev \) is the index that maximizes \( p_{v1} \oplus p_{prev} \).
   - The bitwise XOR operation \( p_{v1} \oplus p_{prev} \) will indeed be maximized because \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value, and the second loop finds the best \( p_{prev} \) to maximize the XOR.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly finds a pair of indices \( (i, j) \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most \( 3n \) queries. The logic and the number of queries are both sound and meet the problem's requirements.
