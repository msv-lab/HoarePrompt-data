Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string `s` contains the character 'G'. The problem description specifies that each round should contain one problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'. However, the program only checks for the characters 'A' to 'F' and does not account for 'G'. This means that if the string `s` lacks the character 'G', the program will not correctly compute the number of additional problems needed.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```
The correct output should be `1` because there is no 'A' in the string, and one 'A' is needed to hold one round. However, the program will output `0` because it does not check for the character 'G'.
