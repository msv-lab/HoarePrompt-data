#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of test cases; each test case should be a tuple containing two integers n and m, and a string a. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, m is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of n characters where each character is from 'A' to 'G'.
def func_1():
    return 0
    #The program returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not take any parameters and always returns 0. It does not modify any external state or variables.
