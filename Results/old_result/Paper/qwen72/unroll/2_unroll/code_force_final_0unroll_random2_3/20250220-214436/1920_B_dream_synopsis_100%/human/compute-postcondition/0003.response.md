Functionality: ** The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of integers. For each test case, it calculates a series of sums based on the elements of `a` and the values of `k` and `x`. It then prints the maximum value from these calculated sums. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the maximum sum for each test case. After the function concludes, the sequence of maximum values for each test case is printed, and the internal variables used for calculations are reset for the next test case. **
