Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `idx_v`. The values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, and `idx` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions along with the new value of `idx_v`.
