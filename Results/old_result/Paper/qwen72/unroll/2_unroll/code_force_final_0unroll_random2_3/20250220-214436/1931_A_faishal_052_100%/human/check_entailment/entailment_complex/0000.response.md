Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the encoded integer `lex` for each.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function attempts to decode the integer `lex` into a 3-letter word by distributing the value among three positions.
   - The logic for distributing the value is flawed:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 to the list and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of having a larger value in the first or second position.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to the list and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it doesn't handle the case where the remaining value could be less than 26.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 to the list and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is again incorrect for the same reason as above.
   - The function then appends the remaining value of `lex` to the list and sorts the list. Sorting the list ensures that the smallest values come first, which is a step in the right direction for finding the lexicographically smallest word.
   - However, the logic for distributing the values is not correct. For example, if `lex` is 24, the function will append two 1s and then 22, which is not the correct distribution. The correct distribution should be 3, 1, and 20.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The function correctly converts the list of integers to a string of characters by adding 96 to each integer and converting it to a character using `chr`.
   - It prints the resulting string for each test case.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `lex = 24`, the correct output should be "aav" (1 + 1 + 22), but the function will output "aaz" (1 + 1 + 22) due to the flawed distribution logic.
   - For `lex = 70`, the correct output should be "rzz" (18 + 26 + 26), but the function will output "zzr" (26 + 26 + 18) due to the flawed distribution logic and sorting.

Given the flawed distribution logic, the function does not correctly generate the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded integer.

Correctness: **False**
