Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix. The program only checks the first instance where the array is not in non-decreasing order and then attempts to split the array at that point. However, this approach is too simplistic and does not account for all possible valid splits.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the problem and a corrected version of the program:

### Problem Explanation
To determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix, we need to check if there exists a split point such that:
1. The suffix (after the split) is non-decreasing.
2. The prefix (before the split) is non-decreasing.
3. The last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix.

### Corrected Program
```python
def can_become_non_decreasing(a):
    n = len(a)
    # Find the first position where the array is not in non-decreasing order
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
            # Check if the array can be split at this position
            suffix = a[i:]
            prefix = a[:i]
            # Check if both parts are non-decreasing
            if all(suffix[i - 1] <= suffix[i] for i in range(1, len(suffix))) and \
               all(prefix[i - 1] <= prefix[i] for i in range(1, len(prefix))):
                # Check if the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix
                if suffix[-1] <= prefix[0]:
                    return True
            # Check if the array can be split at the next position
            suffix = a[i - 1:]
            prefix = a[:i - 1]
            if all(suffix[i - 1] <= suffix[i] for i in range(1, len(suffix))) and \
               all(prefix[i - 1] <= prefix[i] for i in range(1, len(prefix))):
                # Check if the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix
                if suffix[-1] <= prefix[0] if prefix else True:
                    return True
            return False
    return True

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if can_become_non_decreasing(a):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program
1. **Finding the First Non-Decreasing Violation**: The program iterates through the array to find the first position where the array is not in non-decreasing order.
2. **Checking Possible Splits**: For the found position, it checks two possible splits:
   - Split at the current position.
   - Split at the previous position.
3. **Validation of Splits**: For each split, it checks if both the prefix and suffix are non-decreasing and if the last element of the suffix is less than or equal to the first element of the prefix.
4. **Return Result**: If any of the splits satisfy the conditions, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This corrected program should correctly determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping a prefix and a suffix.
