Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in {1, 2, 3} indicating the type of constraint, and x is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^9. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case, and no two constraints are the same.** 

The value of `t` has been updated to the integer value provided by the user input, which is within the range 1 to 500. All other conditions and variable states remain unchanged.
