Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the shape based on the grid. Here are the issues:

1. The program only checks if a row has exactly one '1' or more than one '1'. This is not sufficient to determine if the grid forms a triangle or a square.
2. The program does not account for the structure of the triangle or square. For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should form a pattern (1, 3, 5, ... or 5, 3, 1, ...), and for a square, each row should have the same number of '1's.
3. The program does not handle the case where the grid might have multiple rows with the same number of '1's, which could be part of a square or a triangle.
4. The variable `a` is used to store 'TRIANGLE' if any row has exactly one '1', but this is not a reliable way to determine the shape, especially if the grid has a square with a row of '1's that happens to have only one '1'.
5. The variable `b` is set to 'SQUARE' if any row has more than one '1', but this also does not ensure that the shape is a square, as it could be part of a triangle.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
- Count the number of '1's in each row and store these counts.
- Check if the counts form a valid triangle pattern (increasing and then decreasing by 2, or decreasing and then increasing by 2).
- Check if the counts form a valid square pattern (all counts are the same and greater than 1).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row_counts = []
        for _ in range(n):
            s = input()
            row_counts.append(s.count('1'))
        
        # Check for square
        if all(count == row_counts[0] for count in row_counts) and row_counts[0] > 1:
            print("SQUARE")
        else:
            # Check for triangle
            is_triangle = False
            for k in range(2, n + 1):
                if row_counts == list(range(1, k)) + list(range(k - 1, 0, -1)):
                    is_triangle = True
                    break
                if row_counts == list(range(k - 1, 0, -1)) + list(range(1, k)):
                    is_triangle = True
                    break
            if is_triangle:
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("SQUARE")

func()
```

This version correctly identifies the shape by checking the row counts for both square and triangle patterns.
