Functionality: ** The function `func` takes no input parameters but reads input from the user. It processes a series of strings provided by the user, where each string `s` is of length at most 10 and consists of lowercase English letters. For each string, if the string has a length of 1 or all characters in the string are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by a shuffled version of the string `s` (or a modified version if the shuffled string is the same as the original). The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state is such that all input strings have been processed, and the final output is a series of 'No' or 'Yes' followed by a shuffled string for each input. **
