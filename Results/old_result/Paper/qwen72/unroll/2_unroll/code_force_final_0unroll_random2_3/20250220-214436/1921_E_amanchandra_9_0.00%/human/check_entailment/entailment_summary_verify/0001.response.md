### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The condition `if xa > xb` correctly identifies a draw when Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip. This is because Alice cannot move down and Bob cannot move up, so they cannot meet.

2. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The calculation `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2` is correct for determining the number of moves it would take for both players to potentially meet.

3. **Odd Distance Case:**
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Alice's chip is correct: `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`. These bounds represent the columns where Bob's chip can be after `x` moves.
   - The condition `abs(l - ya) <= x + 1 and abs(r - ya) <= x + 1` is intended to check if Alice can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in `x + 1` moves. However, this condition is incorrect. Alice can only move `x` times, not `x + 1` times. The correct condition should be `l <= ya <= r`.

4. **Even Distance Case:**
   - The calculation of `l` and `r` for Bob's chip is incorrect in the original assessment. It should be `l = max(1, yb - x)` and `r = min(w, yb + x)`.
   - The condition `abs(l - yb) <= x and abs(r - yb) <= x` is incorrect. Bob can only move `x` times, and the correct condition should be `l <= ya <= r`.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(xa - xb) // 2
            if abs(xa - xb) % 2:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[l <= ya <= r])
            else:
                l = max(1, yb - x)
                r = min(w, yb + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[l <= ya <= r])
```

### Correctness:
- The original program has logical errors in the conditions for determining the winner.
- The corrected program correctly checks if Alice or Bob can move to a position within the range `l` to `r` in the appropriate number of moves.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the logical errors in the conditions for determining the winner. The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output for the given problem description. Therefore, the final evaluation is that the original program is incorrect.
