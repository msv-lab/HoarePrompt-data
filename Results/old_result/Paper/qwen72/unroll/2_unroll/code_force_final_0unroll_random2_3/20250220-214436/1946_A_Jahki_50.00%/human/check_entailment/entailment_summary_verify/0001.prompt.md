You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

- Program:
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        op = 0
        if num2 > 10000:
            print(1)
            print(16668)
            break
        else:
            a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
            b = sorted(a)
            if num2 % 2 == 0:
                ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            else:
                ma = int(num2 / 2)
            median = b[ma]
            new_median = median
            while new_median <= median:
                b[ma] += 1
                op += 1
                b = sorted(b)
                new_median = b[ma]
            print(op)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case involves reading an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. If `n` is greater than 10000, the function prints 1 and 16668 and stops processing further test cases. Otherwise, it calculates the number of operations required to increment the median value of the array `a` until it is no longer equal to the original median, and prints this number for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. The variables used within the function are updated for each test case, but their final values depend on the specific input of the last test case processed. The variable `num` (the total number of test cases) remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `num` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `num2` and the array itself `case`.
   - It converts the input string `case` into a list of integers `a`.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The function includes a check for `num2 > 10000` and prints a fixed value `16668` if this condition is met. This is incorrect because the problem constraints guarantee that `1 <= n <= 10^5` and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. Therefore, this check is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The function correctly calculates the index of the median element `ma` based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - It then initializes `median` to the current median value in the sorted array `b`.

4. **Operation Counting**:
   - The function enters a loop to increment the median element until it is greater than the current median.
   - It increments `b[ma]` by 1, increases the operation count `op` by 1, and sorts the array `b` again.
   - This loop continues until `new_median` is greater than `median`.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the number of operations required to increase the median.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling**: The check for `num2 > 10000` is incorrect and unnecessary.
- **Sorting in Loop**: Sorting the array `b` inside the loop is inefficient. The array should be sorted once, and then the necessary elements should be incremented without re-sorting.
- **Median Increment Logic**: The logic for incrementing the median element is flawed. It only increments the element at the median index, which may not be the most efficient way to increase the median. Instead, it should increment the smallest element that is less than or equal to the current median until the median is increased.

### Correct Approach:
- **Sort the Array Once**: Sort the array `b` once before entering the loop.
- **Increment the Correct Element**: Increment the smallest element that is less than or equal to the current median until the median is increased.
- **Remove Unnecessary Edge Case**: Remove the check for `num2 > 10000`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(0, num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split() if i.isdigit()]
        b = sorted(a)
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
            next_ma = int(num2 / 2)
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
            next_ma = ma
        median = b[ma]
        next_median = b[next_ma]
        if median == next_median:
            next_median += 1
        op = 0
        while b[ma] < next_median:
            b[ma] += 1
            op += 1
        print(op)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Sorting Once**: The array `b` is sorted once before entering the loop.
- **Correct Median Increment**: The loop increments the element at the median index `ma` until it is greater than or equal to the next median value `next_median`.
- **Efficiency**: This approach avoids re-sorting the array in each iteration, making it more efficient.

### Final Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the unnecessary edge case handling and inefficient sorting in the loop. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem.
