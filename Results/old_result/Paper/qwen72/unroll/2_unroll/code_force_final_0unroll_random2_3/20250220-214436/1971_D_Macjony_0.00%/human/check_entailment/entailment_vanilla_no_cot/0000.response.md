Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program counts the number of contiguous character changes in the string and adjusts the count based on a flag, but this approach does not accurately determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

The correct approach should be to count the number of '1's that appear before the last '0' in the string. This is because each '1' that appears before the last '0' will need to be in a separate piece to ensure that all '0's come before all '1's in the final rearranged string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        last_zero_index = -1
        for j in range(len(s)):
            if s[j] == '0':
                last_zero_index = j
        count = 1
        for j in range(last_zero_index):
            if s[j] == '1':
                count += 1
        print(count)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This program correctly identifies the minimum number of pieces needed by finding the last index of '0' and counting the number of '1's that appear before this index. If there are no '1's before the last '0', the string is already sorted, and only one piece is needed.
