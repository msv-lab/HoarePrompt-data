Reasoning:  
The program is designed to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` and output the remainder of the product of the current elements of `a` modulo `m` at each step. However, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**: The function `func_1` appends the elements of `a` to `b` based on the commands 'L' or 'R', but it does not calculate the product of the remaining elements of `a` at each step. Instead, it calculates the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not the same as the product of the remaining elements of `a`.

2. **Modulo Operation Missing**: The function does not take the modulo `m` of the product at each step, which is a critical part of the problem statement.

3. **Order of Operations**: The function should output the remainder of the product of the current state of `a` before removing an element, but it does not do this. It only appends the elements to `b` and then calculates the cumulative product.

To correct the program, we need to:
- Calculate the product of the current state of `a` at each step.
- Take the modulo `m` of this product.
- Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = (product * a[l]) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = (product * a[r]) % m
            r -= 1
        b.append(product)
    return b
```

This corrected function:
- Maintains a `product` variable that is updated at each step with the current element being removed.
- Takes the modulo `m` of the product at each step.
- Appends the current product to the list `b` before removing the element.

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
