Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in the string `s`. 

### Issue 1: Incorrect Subsequence Check
The function `func_1` attempts to build a string `s1` by removing characters from the set `alphabet` as they are encountered in `s`. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked. For example, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

For the third test case:
- `n = 3`, `k = 3`, `m = 10`
- `s = "aabbccabab"`

The program should check if all possible strings of length 3 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (i.e., "aaa", "aab", "aac", "aba", "abb", "abc", "aca", "acb", "acc", "baa", "bab", "bac", "bba", "bbb", "bbc", "bca", "bcb", "bcc", "caa", "cab", "cac", "cba", "cbb", "cbc", "cca", "ccb", "ccc") occur as a subsequence in `s`.

However, the function `func_1` only builds a string `s1` by removing characters from the set `alphabet` and does not check all possible subsequences. This means it may incorrectly return `True` even if some subsequences are missing.

### Issue 2: Incorrect Construction of Missing Subsequence
The program constructs a missing subsequence by appending the same character multiple times. This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the constructed string is a valid subsequence that is missing from `s`. For example, if the string `s` is "aabbccabab" and the program is supposed to find a missing subsequence of length 3 using the first 3 alphabets, it might incorrectly construct "ccc" even if "ccc" is not a valid missing subsequence.

### Example Case:
Consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

The program should output:
```
NO
ccc
```

However, the program might output:
```
NO
bbb
```

This is incorrect because "bbb" is a valid subsequence in "aabbccabab".

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case, and it fails to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
