### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains either '<' or '>'. A pinball is placed on each cell, and it moves according to the direction of the cell it is on. After each move, the direction of the cell is inverted. The goal is to determine how many seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(arr, times)` calculates the difference between the last position in `arr` and the position `times` moves before the last position. This function is used to help compute the positions and times in `func_2`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - `func_2(s1, n)` is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - **Initialization**:
     - `pre` is a list of indices where the character is '>'.
     - `totalOne` is the count of '>' characters in `s1`.
     - `preOne` is a cumulative sum list of `pre` with an initial value of 0.
     - `suffZero` is a list that will store the cumulative sum of indices where the character is '<' as we move from right to left.
     - `ans` is a list of length `n` initialized to 0, which will store the results.
   - **Processing**:
     - The function iterates over the string `s1` from right to left.
     - For each cell, it checks if the character is '>' or '<'.
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time using the positions stored in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
     - If the character is '<', it updates the `suffZero` list and calculates the time using the positions stored in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
     - The results are stored in the `ans` list.
   - **Output**:
     - The function prints the results stored in `ans`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles the movement of the pinball and the inversion of the direction of the cells.
   - The use of `preOne` and `suffZero` helps in efficiently calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - The logic for handling the cases where the pinball moves left or right is correctly implemented.
   - The function `func_1` is used to compute the necessary positions and times, and it is called appropriately within `func_2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. The use of cumulative sums and the correct handling of the pinball's movement and direction inversion ensure that the results are accurate.

Correctness: **True**
