The function `func` should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `screenshots`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and n · k ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of participants and the number of screenshots, respectively. `screenshots` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers representing the order of participants shown to the participant who posted the screenshot.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and indicates the order of participants based on the provided screenshots.
