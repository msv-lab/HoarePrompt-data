Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `prod`:**
   - The program calculates `prod` as the product of all multipliers `k_i`. This is not the correct approach. The goal is to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. The product of all multipliers does not help in achieving this goal.

2. **Incorrect Bet Calculation:**
   - The program sets each bet `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`. This means that each bet is the product of all multipliers divided by the current multiplier. This approach does not ensure that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Incorrect Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `sumo >= prod`. This condition is not relevant to the problem. The correct condition should be to check if the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome, which is `sumo < min(k_i * a[i])`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to find a set of bets `x_i` such that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. One way to do this is to set each bet `x_i` to a value that ensures the sum of all bets is less than the minimum return for any winning outcome.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for T in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        k = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Calculate the sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers
        total = sum(1 / ki for ki in k)
        
        # If the sum of the reciprocals is >= 1, no solution exists
        if total >= 1:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # Calculate the minimum bet required to ensure a win
            min_bet = 1 / (1 - total)
            bets = [int(min_bet / ki) for ki in k]
            
            # Ensure the sum of bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome
            while sum(bets) >= min(ki * bi for ki, bi in zip(k, bets)):
                bets = [bi + 1 for bi in bets]
            
            # Print the bets
            print(' '.join(map(str, bets)))

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Sum of Reciprocals:**
   - The sum of the reciprocals of the multipliers `k_i` is calculated. If this sum is greater than or equal to 1, it means there is no way to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

2. **Minimum Bet Calculation:**
   - The minimum bet required to ensure a win is calculated as `1 / (1 - total)`. This ensures that the sum of the bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome.

3. **Adjust Bets:**
   - The bets are adjusted to ensure that the sum of all bets is strictly less than the return for any winning outcome. This is done by incrementing the bets until the condition is met.

4. **Output:**
   - The bets are printed in the required format.

This corrected approach ensures that the program meets the problem's requirements.
