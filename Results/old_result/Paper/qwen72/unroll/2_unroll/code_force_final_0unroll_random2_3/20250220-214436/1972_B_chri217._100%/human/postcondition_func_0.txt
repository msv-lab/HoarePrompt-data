The function reads from the standard input to collect `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` containing only the characters "U" and "D". The function returns a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains the integer `n` and the string `s`.
