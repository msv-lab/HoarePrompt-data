Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers provided by the user input, `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and the value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where 1 ≤ `start` ≤ `n`, `edges` is an empty list, `empty` is True, `nodes` is now a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, but the `nodes` dictionary is now a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. This means that if a key is accessed that does not exist in `nodes`, it will automatically create an empty list for that key.
