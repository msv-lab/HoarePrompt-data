The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and the list `digits`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `digits`. If `digits` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the string `password`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `digits` has at least one element and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`digits` is a sorted list containing all the digits from the string `password` and must have at least one element, `i` is 0**
