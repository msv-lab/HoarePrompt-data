The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts two parameters: `t` and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4. For each test case, `n` is an integer with the constraint 3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5, and `a` is a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so it is unclear what the function returns.
