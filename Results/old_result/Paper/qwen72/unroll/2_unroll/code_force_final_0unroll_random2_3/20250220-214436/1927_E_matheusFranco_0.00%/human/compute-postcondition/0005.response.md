The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. Given the initial state, `k` is an even integer and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, which means `k` is already greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `k` to ensure the loop executes. However, the variable `i` needs to be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 1, `i` is 0**
