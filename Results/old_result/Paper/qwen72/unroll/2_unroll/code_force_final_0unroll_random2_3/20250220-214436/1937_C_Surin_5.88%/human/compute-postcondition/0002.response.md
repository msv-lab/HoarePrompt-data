The only objects in the loop head are the variables `kp` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure that the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `kp` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function, which is the default starting point for a `range` loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided is an integer greater than 0, and `kp` will start at 0.

State: **`R` is a lambda function that reads an integer from input and converts it to an integer, `kp` is 0, the input must be an integer greater than 0**
