The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer value provided by the user, and `i` is the loop index which starts at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 32, `i` is 0**
