Postcondition: **`r` is a list of integers, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + a`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - a`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. If `y2 <= y1`, then `x1` is equal to `r[2] + 1 + (r[5] - 1)`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - (r[5] - 1)`, `y1` is equal to `r[3] - 1 - (r[5] - 1)`, `y2` is equal to 1, `a` is equal to `r[5] - 1`, `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, `t` is equal to `abs(1 - (r[3] - 1))`, and `c` is equal to `y1 - 1`. Otherwise, if `y2 > y1`, then `y1` is now equal to `y1 + a`, `y1` is not equal to `y2`, `y1` is less than `y2`, `y2` is now equal to `m`, `c` is equal to `m - y1`, and `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`. Additionally, either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 < 1`, or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1`, or `x1 > n`.**
