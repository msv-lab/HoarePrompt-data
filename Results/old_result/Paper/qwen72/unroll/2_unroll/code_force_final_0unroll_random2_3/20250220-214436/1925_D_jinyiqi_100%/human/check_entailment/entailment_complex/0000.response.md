Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input, and then reads `m` tuples of integers `a_i`, `b_i`, and `f_i`.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**: The function correctly calculates the sum of the initial friendship values `sum_f` for all pairs of friends.

3. **Combination Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the number of possible pairs of children `cn2` using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is:
     \[
     \text{p} = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     \text{q} = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]
   - This formula is derived from the expected value of the sum of friendship values over `k` excursions. The term \( 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \text{sum_f} \) accounts for the initial friendship values being chosen and the term \( m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1) \) accounts for the increase in friendship values for each pair over subsequent excursions.

5. **GCD and Simplification**: The function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q` and simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their GCD.

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Calculation**: The function correctly computes the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` and then calculates the final result as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \).

7. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the expected value of the sum of friendship values modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
