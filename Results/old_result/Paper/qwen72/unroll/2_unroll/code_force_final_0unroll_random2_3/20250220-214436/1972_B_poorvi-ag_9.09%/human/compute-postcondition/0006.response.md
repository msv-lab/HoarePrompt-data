Output State: The `results` list will remain unchanged, containing `t` elements, each of which is either 'yes' or 'no'. The values of `n` and `s` will still be undefined or reset after each iteration, as they are re-assigned within the loop. Each element in the `results` list will be printed to the console in the order they appear in the list.
