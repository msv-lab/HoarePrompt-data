The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases, and `t` is the number of test cases. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
