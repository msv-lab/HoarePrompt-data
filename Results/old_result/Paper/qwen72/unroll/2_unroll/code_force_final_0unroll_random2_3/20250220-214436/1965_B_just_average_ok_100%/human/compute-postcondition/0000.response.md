The only variables in the loop head are the loop variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, the state of `_` should be considered as it will be the loop variable, and it will start from 0 (the default behavior of `range`).

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
