Reasoning:  
The program provided is partially correct but has limitations and issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Limited Range Handling**: The program only handles cases where `n` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. For any other value of `n` within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), it prints 'No esta en el rango', which is incorrect according to the problem statement. The program should generate a checkerboard for any valid `n` (1 to 20).

2. **Pattern Generation**: The program correctly generates the checkerboard pattern for `n` values 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, it does not generalize the pattern generation for other values of `n`.

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`casos`) and then processes each test case by reading an integer `n`. This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints the checkerboard pattern without spaces, which is correct as per the problem description.

To make the program fully correct, it should generate the checkerboard pattern for any valid `n` (1 to 20) and not just for `n` values 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Given these points, the program is **incorrect** because it does not meet the requirement of generating the checkerboard pattern for all valid `n` values (1 to 20).

Correctness: **False**
