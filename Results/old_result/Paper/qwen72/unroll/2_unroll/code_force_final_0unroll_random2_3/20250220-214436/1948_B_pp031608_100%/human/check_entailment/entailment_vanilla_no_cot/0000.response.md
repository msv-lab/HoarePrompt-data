Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the transformation of elements that are at least 10. Specifically, the program attempts to split an element into its digits and insert them back into the array, but it does not properly handle the insertion of digits in the correct position. Additionally, the program only checks the immediate next element after a split, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be sorted.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_be_sorted():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1):
            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
                # Check if splitting arr[i] can help
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(arr[i])]
                new_arr = arr[:i] + digits + arr[i+1:]
                if new_arr != sorted(new_arr):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr = new_arr
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])

can_be_sorted()
```

This corrected version properly splits the elements into their digits and checks if the resulting array can be sorted in non-decreasing order. If at any point the array cannot be sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
