#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n` (where 3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of size `n` where the elements at the middle index and its symmetric counterpart are filled based on the values in `odds`. For each value `x` in `odds`, if the current index `idx` is the middle index of `a`, the corresponding element in `a` is set to `x`. Otherwise, the elements at `idx` and its symmetric counterpart `n - 1 - idx` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`, where `prev` is the previous value in `odds`. The function processes all elements in `odds` and fills the list `a` accordingly, ensuring that the list is symmetric around its middle.
