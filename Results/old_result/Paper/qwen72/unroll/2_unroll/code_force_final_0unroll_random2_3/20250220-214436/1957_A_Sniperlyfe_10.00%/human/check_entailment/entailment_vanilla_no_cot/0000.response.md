Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function. The function calculates the number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed from the sticks, but it does not consider the possibility of forming other regular polygons with different numbers of sides (e.g., triangles, pentagons, hexagons, etc.).

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed for any number of sides, not just squares. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    
    max_polygons = 0
    for v in freq.values():
        for sides in range(3, 101):  # Regular polygons can have 3 to 100 sides
            max_polygons += v // sides
    
    return max_polygons
```

This version of the program correctly calculates the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed for any number of sides from 3 to 100, which is the range of possible polygons given the constraints.
