Reasoning:  
The provided function `func_1` is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array for each test case. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to determine the "beautiful pairs". The function checks if the sum of two numbers `a_i` and `a_j` is divisible by `x` and if the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`. The logic in the function, however, is not correctly implementing this check.

1. **Sum Divisibility by `x`**: The function correctly calculates the required `mod_x` for a number `num` to form a pair with another number such that their sum is divisible by `x`. This is done using `(x - mod_x) % x`.

2. **Difference Divisibility by `y`**: The function incorrectly assumes that the difference `a_i - a_j` being divisible by `y` means that `a_i % y` should be equal to `a_j % y`. However, this is not always true. For the difference `a_i - a_j` to be divisible by `y`, `a_i % y` should be equal to `a_j % y` or `a_i % y` should be equal to `(a_j % y + y) % y` (considering the negative difference).

3. **Frequency Counting**: The function uses a frequency dictionary `freq` to count how many numbers have the same `mod_x` and `mod_y` values. This is a good approach for counting pairs, but the logic for checking the "beautiful pairs" is flawed.

4. **Output**: The function correctly appends the count of beautiful pairs to the `results` list and returns this list at the end.

Given the above points, the function does not correctly implement the condition for a pair to be beautiful, specifically the condition for the difference to be divisible by `y`.

Correctness: **False**
