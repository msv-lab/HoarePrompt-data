### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of days, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought per day, and the total number of tickets to buy, respectively.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Sorting the Prices:**
   - The function sorts the list of ticket prices in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it allows us to buy tickets at the lowest possible prices first, which is essential for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization:**
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to store the number of tickets bought on the current day.
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`. This initialization is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of the problem. The variable `c` should be initialized to 0 to store the total cost.

4. **Ticket Purchase Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each day.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that the number of tickets bought on the current day does not exceed the daily limit `m` or the remaining number of tickets `k`.
   - The remaining number of tickets `k` is then decremented by `s`.
   - The total cost `c` is updated by adding the cost of buying `s` tickets on the current day, which is `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula is incorrect. The correct formula should be `l[i] * s` because the cost of buying `s` tickets at price `l[i]` is simply `l[i] * s`.

5. **Output:**
   - After the loop, the function prints the integer value of `c`.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Initialization of `c`:**
  - The variable `c` should be initialized to 0, not `k * k / 2`.
- **Incorrect Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation inside the loop should be `c += l[i] * s`, not `c += l[i] * s - s * s / 2`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        l.sort()
        c = 0
        for i in range(n):
            s = min(m, k)
            k -= s
            c += l[i] * s
        print(c)
```

### Evaluation:
- The original program has two significant issues:
  1. **Incorrect Initialization of `c`:** The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is not the correct initial value for the total cost. It should be initialized to 0.
  2. **Incorrect Cost Calculation:** The formula used to update the total cost `c` inside the loop is `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`, which is incorrect. The correct formula should be `l[i] * s`.

These issues lead to incorrect results for the test cases. The corrected program addresses these issues and should produce the correct output.

### Final:
- The original program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
