### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_2()`.
   - It then reads the prices for Alice (`prices`) and the prices for Bob (`bonuses`) using `func_2()`.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - The program creates a list `combined` that pairs the negative of Alice's prices with Bob's prices. This is done to facilitate the use of a min-heap to keep track of the smallest values, which will be useful for Bob's strategy.
   - The `combined` list is sorted by Bob's prices in ascending order. This ensures that the items with the smallest Bob's prices are considered first, which is optimal for Bob's strategy of minimizing Alice's profit.

3. **Heap Initialization**:
   - The program initializes a min-heap `heap` to keep track of the `k` items that Bob will take for free.
   - It also initializes a list `remaining_items` to keep track of the items that are not in the heap.

4. **Heap Population**:
   - The program pushes the first `k` items from the `combined` list into the heap. These items are the ones Bob will take for free, and they are the ones with the smallest Bob's prices.

5. **Profit Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the initial profit using `func_3()`, which sums the Bob's prices of the items in the heap and adds the combined profit of the remaining items.
   - It then iterates through the remaining items in `combined` and updates the profit by:
     - Removing the smallest Bob's price from the heap (the one Bob will take for free).
     - Adding the current item to the heap.
     - Adjusting the profit based on the changes in the heap and the current item.
   - The program keeps track of the maximum profit seen so far.

6. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the maximum profit.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Calls**:
  - The initial state of the program is correctly described. No variables are directly passed to `func_4()`, but it relies on the outputs from `func_1()` and `func_2()`.

- **Function 1**:
  - The function reads an integer from the input and returns it. This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Function 2**:
  - The function reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts the elements to integers, and returns a map object. This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Function 3**:
  - The function calculates the total profit by summing the Bob's prices of the items in the heap and adding the combined profit of the remaining items where the sum of the prices for each item is non-negative. This is correct and matches the problem description.

- **Function 4**:
  - The function reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, the prices for Alice, and the prices for Bob.
  - It creates the `combined` list and sorts it by Bob's prices.
  - It initializes the heap with the first `k` items from the `combined` list.
  - It calculates the initial profit using `func_3()`.
  - It iterates through the remaining items, updating the profit and the heap, and keeps track of the maximum profit.
  - Finally, it prints the maximum profit for each test case.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case where `k` is 0**:
  - The program correctly handles this case by summing the Bob's prices of the items Alice buys and subtracting the Alice's prices.
- **Case where `k` is equal to `n`**:
  - The program ensures that Bob takes all items for free, which results in a profit of 0 if Alice buys all items.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**:
  - The time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step and the heap operations.
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the `combined` list and the heap.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly implements the logic for both Alice and Bob acting optimally. It handles the input and output as specified and follows the correct strategy for maximizing Alice's profit while minimizing Bob's contribution. The annotations and the original assessment are accurate.

Final: **True**
