### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and the number of elements `m` in each test case.
   - It also correctly reads the list of integers `arr` for each test case.

2. **Logic for Checking Non-decreasing Order**:
   - The function iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the second-to-last element.
   - For each element `arr[i]` that is less than the previous element `arr[i - 1]`, it checks if the digits of `arr[i - 1]` can be split and inserted in such a way that the resulting subarray is sorted.
   - If the resulting subarray is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the loop completes without setting `ans` to `False`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `ans` is set to `False`, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the array is already sorted correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains elements that are less than 10, which cannot be split further.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The logic for checking if the digits of `arr[i - 1]` can be split and inserted correctly is flawed. Specifically, the line `nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]` does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem. It should only split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and check if the resulting array is sorted.
   - The correct approach would be to split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and then check if the resulting array is sorted. If it is, the operation can be applied, and the function should continue checking the rest of the array.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should split `arr[i - 1]` into its digits and then check if the resulting array is sorted. If it is, the function should continue checking the rest of the array.
