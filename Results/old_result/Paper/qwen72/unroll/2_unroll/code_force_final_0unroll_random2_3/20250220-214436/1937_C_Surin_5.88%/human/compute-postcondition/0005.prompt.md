You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is a sequence of queries and responses. The sequence p is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1} for each test case, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries of the form "? a b c d" where 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and must output a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    I = lambda : list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    R = lambda : int(input())
    for kp in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        g = 0
        
        v1 = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            v2 = i
            print(f'? {v1} {v1} {v2} {v2}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input('')
            if r == '<':
                v1 = v2
        
        prev = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print(f'? {v1} {i} {v1} {prev}')
            sys.stdout.flush()
            r = input()
            if r == '>':
                prev = i
        
        print(f'! {prev} {v1}')
        
        sys.stdout.flush()
        
    #State: The loop will execute `kp` times, where `kp` is the integer input at the beginning. For each iteration of the loop, `n` is set to the integer input provided for that iteration. After the loop completes, `v1` will be the largest integer less than `n` for which the first query returned '<', and `prev` will be the largest integer less than `n` for which the second query returned '>'. The final output for each iteration will be `! {prev} {v1}`. The initial state of the lambda function `R` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to find a pair of indices (i, j) from a permutation p of {0, 1, ..., n-1} such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. It returns the pair of indices (i, j) that achieve this maximum XOR value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
