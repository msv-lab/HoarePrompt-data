You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case and contains integers. The first integer in each inner list is the number of sticks n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), followed by n integers representing the lengths of the sticks (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100).
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `freq` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from the test cases in `arr`, and the values are the counts of how many times each integer appears as the first element in the inner lists of `arr`.
    return sum(v // 4 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, where each inner list contains the number of sticks `n` followed by `n` integers representing stick lengths. It returns the sum of the integer division of each stick length frequency by 4.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the sum of the integer division of each value in the `freq` dictionary by 4.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
