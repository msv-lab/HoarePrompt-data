Precondition: **The function should take two non-negative integers x and y as input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons respectively.** 

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:

```python
def min_screens(x, y):
```

With the precondition:

**x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.**
