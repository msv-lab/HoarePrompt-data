Output State: **`r` is a list of integers, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. `n` is equal to `r[0]`, `m` is equal to `r[1]`, `x1` is equal to `r[2] + (m - y1)`, `y1` is equal to `m`, `x2` is equal to `r[4] - (m - y1)`, and `y2` is equal to `r[5]`. Additionally, `x2` is greater than `x1`, and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even. `y1` is not equal to `y2`. `a` is equal to `m - y1`. `b` is equal to `x2 - x1`. `t` is equal to `abs(y2 - y1)`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. `y1` is greater than `y2`.**
