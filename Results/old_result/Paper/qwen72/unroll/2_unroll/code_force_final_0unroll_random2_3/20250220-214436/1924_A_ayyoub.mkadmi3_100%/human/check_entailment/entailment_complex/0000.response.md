Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the parameters for each test case. It also reads the string `s` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`.
   - **Initialization**: It initializes `s1` and `s2` as empty strings and creates a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - **Processing `s`**:
     - It iterates through each character `i` in `s`.
     - If `i` is in the `alphabet` set, it is added to `s1`.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains more than one character, `i` is removed from the set.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains only one character, `i` is added to `s2` and the `alphabet` set is reset to its initial state.
   - **Output Calculation**:
     - It calculates `r` as the quotient of the length of `s1` divided by `k`.
     - It returns a tuple containing:
       - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
       - A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end.
       - The string `s2` which contains the last character of `s` that was in the initial alphabet set, repeated `n` times.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and checks the boolean value returned.
   - If the boolean value is `False`, it appends "No" to the output list `OUT` and constructs a string that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` by appending the missing character `n` times to `s2`.
   - If the boolean value is `True`, it appends "Yes" to the output list `OUT`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints each element of the `OUT` list, which contains the results for each test case.

**Issues**:
- **Subsequence Check**: The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as subsequences in `s`. It only processes the string to create `s1` and `s2` but does not verify if all combinations are present.
- **String Construction**: The construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence is flawed. It only checks for the presence of a single character in `s1` and constructs a string with that character repeated, which may not be a valid non-subsequence string.

**Correctness**:
- The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It fails to check all possible subsequences of length `n` and does not construct a valid non-subsequence string when needed.

Correctness: **False**
