### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for k excursions.
   - Each pair of children has a friendship value that increases by 1 if they are chosen for an excursion.
   - The expected value is given as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are coprime, and we need to output \(p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) and initializes the sum of friendship values \(sum_f\) to 0.
   - It then reads the \(m\) pairs of friends and their initial friendship values, summing them up in \(sum_f\).

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The number of ways to choose a pair of children from \(n\) children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), which is correctly calculated as \(cn2\).

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair chosen in \(k\) excursions can be broken down into two parts:
     - The initial friendship values of the pairs.
     - The increase in friendship values due to being chosen in subsequent excursions.
   - The initial contribution to the expected value is \(k \times \frac{sum_f}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - For each subsequent excursion, the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1. The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in \(k\) excursions is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The total expected increase in friendship value for all pairs over \(k\) excursions is \(\frac{k(k-1)}{2} \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}\).

5. **Combining Contributions**:
   - The total expected value is the sum of the initial contribution and the expected increase:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = k \times \frac{sum_f}{\binom{n}{2}} + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \times \frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - This can be simplified to:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2k \times sum_f + k(k-1) \times m}{2 \times \binom{n}{2}}
     \]
   - The program correctly calculates \(p\) and \(q\) as:
     \[
     p = 2k \times \binom{n}{2} \times sum_f + m \times k \times (k-1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \times \binom{n}{2}^2
     \]

6. **Simplification and Modulo Operation**:
   - The program correctly simplifies \(p\) and \(q\) by dividing them by their greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - It then calculates the modular inverse of \(q\) using `pow(q, -1, M)` and multiplies it by \(p\) to get the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all pairs chosen in \(k\) excursions, and it handles the modular arithmetic correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
