### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The function `func_5` starts by reading two integers `n` and `k` using `func_3`. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the first line of each test case contains `n` and `k`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value `v`:**
   - The function then iterates over the range `[n, 1]` in reverse order, making queries in the format `? 1 {i * n}`. This query checks the smallest `r` such that `f(1, r) = i * n`. If `v` (the response from `func_2`) equals `n`, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The purpose of this loop is to find the largest `i` such that `f(1, n) = i * n`. This is a valid approach because the maximum value of `f(1, r)` for any `r` in `[1, n]` is `n * max(a_1, ..., a_n)`, and the loop is essentially trying to find the largest `i` such that `i * n` is a valid `f(1, r)` value.

3. **Checking for Subarrays:**
   - After finding `v`, the function iterates over the range `[1, n // k]` to check if there exists a sequence of subarrays that satisfy the condition `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1} + 1, n) = m` where `m = i * v`.
   - For each `i` in the range, it performs a series of queries in the format `? l {i * v}` where `l` starts from 1 and increments by the value returned by `func_2` + 1. This is a valid approach because it is trying to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = i * v` for each starting point `l`.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - If the conditions are met (i.e., `cnt == 0` and `l == n + 1`), it prints the answer `! {i * v}` and returns.
   - If no such conditions are met, it prints `! -1` and returns.

### Analysis:
- The function `func_5` correctly follows the problem's constraints and logic. It uses the queries to find the largest possible value `m` that can be used to split the array into `k` subarrays with the required properties.
- The function handles the case where no such `m` exists by printing `! -1`.
- The function also ensures that the number of queries does not exceed the limit of `2n` by breaking out of the loop once a valid `v` is found and by iterating over the range `[1, n // k]`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_5` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It follows the constraints and uses the queries efficiently to find the largest `m` or determine that no such `m` exists.

**Correctness: **True****
