Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed:

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- Each integer in `r` represents the number of valid integers between the maximum of type 1 constraints and the minimum of type 2 constraints, excluding any type 3 constraints, for each test case.
- The length of `r` is equal to `t`, where `t` is the number of test cases.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print(*r, sep='\n')
```

### Explanation:
- The `print` function is called with the unpacked list `r` and the `sep` parameter set to `'\n'`.
- The `*` operator unpacks the list `r`, meaning each element of `r` will be passed as a separate argument to the `print` function.
- The `sep='\n'` parameter ensures that each element of `r` is printed on a new line.

### Output:
The `print` statement will print each element of the list `r` on a new line. Each element represents the number of valid integers for a specific test case, as described in the initial state.

Output: **[r[0]]
[r[1]]
...
[r[t-1]] (where each r[i] is the number of valid integers for the i-th test case)**
