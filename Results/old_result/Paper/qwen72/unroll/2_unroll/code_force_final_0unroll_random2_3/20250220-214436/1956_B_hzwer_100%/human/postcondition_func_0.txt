The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of integers in `a` that appear more than once. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the standard output. After the function concludes, the state of the program is such that `t` test cases have been processed, and the results for each test case have been printed. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the function.
