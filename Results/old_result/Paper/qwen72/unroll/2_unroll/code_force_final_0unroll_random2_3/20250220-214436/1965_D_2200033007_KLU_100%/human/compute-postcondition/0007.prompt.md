You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of the hidden palindrome array, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, indicating the size of the array a.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: `a` is a list where the elements at indices `(n - 1) // 2` and its symmetric counterpart `n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2` are filled with the values derived from the `odds` list. For each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` is the middle index, `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The `prev` variable is updated to the current `x` in each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1. The loop continues until all elements in `odds` are processed.
    return a
    #The program returns the list `a` where the elements at indices `(n - 1) // 2` and its symmetric counterpart `n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2` are filled with values derived from the `odds` list. For each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` is the middle index, `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The `prev` variable is updated to the current `x` in each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1. The loop continues until all elements in `odds` are processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n` (3 <= n <= 1000). It returns a list `a` of size `n` where the elements at the middle index and its symmetric counterpart are filled based on the values in `odds`. For each value in `odds`, if the current index is the middle index, the corresponding element in `a` is set to that value. Otherwise, the elements at the current index and its symmetric counterpart are set to half the difference between the current value and the previous value in `odds`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the list `a` where the elements at indices `(n - 1) // 2` and its symmetric counterpart `n - 1 - (n - 1) // 2` are filled with values derived from the `odds` list. For each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` is the middle index, `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The `prev` variable is updated to the current `x` in each iteration, and `idx` is decremented by 1. The loop continues until all elements in `odds` are processed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
