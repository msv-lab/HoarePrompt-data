Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**
   - The game is played in turns, starting with Alice.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet.
   - After deciding whether to swap, the player must remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., remove a coin) loses.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The game essentially reduces to a parity problem. The player who ends up with the wallet that has an odd number of coins first will be the one who can force the other player to lose.
   - If the number of coins in both wallets is the same (i.e., \(a = b\)), the game will always end in a draw or a loss for the player who starts (Alice), because both players will always have the same number of coins and the same moves available.
   - If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with the wallet that has an odd number of coins first will have the advantage.

3. **Parity Analysis:**
   - If \(a\) and \(b\) are both even or both odd, the difference \(|a - b|\) will be even.
   - If \(a\) and \(b\) are of different parities (one even, one odd), the difference \(|a - b|\) will be odd.

4. **Winning Strategy:**
   - If \(|a - b|\) is even, Bob can always mirror Alice's moves. This means that if Alice swaps, Bob swaps; if Alice keeps, Bob keeps. This ensures that Bob will always be able to make a move after Alice, and Alice will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.
   - If \(|a - b|\) is odd, Alice can force Bob into a position where Bob will be the one who cannot make a move. Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob with an even number of coins, and Bob will eventually be the one who cannot make a move.

5. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if the absolute difference \(|a - b|\) is even.
   - If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic based on the parity of the difference between the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets.
   - The logic matches the winning strategy described above.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
