Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. It processes multiple test cases, parses the constraints, and calculates the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the constraints. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then reads each constraint.

2. **Constraint Parsing**:
   - The program categorizes the constraints into three lists: `big` for constraints of type 1 (k must be greater than or equal to x), `less` for constraints of type 2 (k must be less than or equal to x), and `no` for constraints of type 3 (k must not be equal to x).

3. **Range Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the range of possible values for `k` by finding the minimum value in `less` and the maximum value in `big`. The number of integers in this range is `min(less) - max(big) + 1`.

4. **Exclusion of Forbidden Values**:
   - The program then iterates through the `no` list to exclude any values that fall within the calculated range. If a value `i` in `no` is within the range `[max(big), min(less)]`, it decrements the count `num` by 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final count `num` for each test case, ensuring that if the count is less than 1, it prints 0.

The program handles all the constraints and edge cases correctly, ensuring that the output is the number of integers `k` that satisfy all the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
