The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. Given the constraints that `x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, the function returns a value based on these inputs. However, since the function definition does not include these parameters in its signature, it's not clear how `x` and `y` are used or provided. Assuming `x` and `y` are used internally or provided through other means (e.g., global variables), the function's output would depend on the relationship between `x` and `y`. Since the output is not specified, we cannot determine the exact return value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a value based on internal or externally provided non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 99). The specific return value is not defined.**
