Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly determine the shape drawn on the grid. The logic in the program is flawed because it only checks if a row has exactly one '1' or more than one '1', and it does not account for the specific patterns of a triangle or a square.

For a triangle, the program should check that the number of '1's in each row forms a sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, etc.) and that these '1's are centered in the grid.

For a square, the program should check that each row has the same number of consecutive '1's, and these '1's are aligned in the same column.

The current program will incorrectly identify a grid as a square if any row has more than one '1', regardless of the pattern, and it will incorrectly identify a grid as a triangle if any row has exactly one '1', even if that row is not part of a valid triangle pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for a square
        is_square = True
        for row in grid:
            if '1' in row and row.count('1') != row.find('1') + row.rfind('1') + 1:
                is_square = False
                break
        
        if is_square:
            print("SQUARE")
            continue
        
        # Check for a triangle
        is_triangle = True
        center = None
        for i, row in enumerate(grid):
            ones = row.count('1')
            if ones > 0:
                if ones != 2 * i + 1:
                    is_triangle = False
                    break
                if center is None:
                    center = row.find('1') + ones // 2
                elif row.find('1') + ones // 2 != center:
                    is_triangle = False
                    break
        
        if is_triangle:
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            # Check for an upside-down triangle
            is_triangle = True
            center = None
            for i, row in enumerate(reversed(grid)):
                ones = row.count('1')
                if ones > 0:
                    if ones != 2 * i + 1:
                        is_triangle = False
                        break
                    if center is None:
                        center = row.find('1') + ones // 2
                    elif row.find('1') + ones // 2 != center:
                        is_triangle = False
                        break
            
            if is_triangle:
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("SQUARE")

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version checks for both the square and the triangle patterns, including the possibility of an upside-down triangle, and ensures that the '1's are correctly aligned and counted.
