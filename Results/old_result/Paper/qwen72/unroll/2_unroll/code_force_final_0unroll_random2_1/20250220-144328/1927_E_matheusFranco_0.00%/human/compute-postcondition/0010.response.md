Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts no parameters but reads two integers `n` and `k` from user input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. It generates a permutation list of length `n` where the values from `1` to `k` are repeated in a pattern every `k` elements. The function then prints this permutation list as a space-separated string. After the function concludes, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the permutation list is printed in the specified format. **
