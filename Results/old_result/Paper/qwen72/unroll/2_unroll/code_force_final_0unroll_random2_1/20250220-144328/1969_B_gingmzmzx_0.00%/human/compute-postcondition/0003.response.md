The function `func_1` accepts a parameter, which is a list of binary strings. Each binary string `s` in the list has a length that satisfies 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of the lengths of all strings in the list does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input list of binary strings.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of binary strings, where each string has a length between 2 and 2 · 10^5, and the total length of all strings combined does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns a result based on the input list of binary strings.**
