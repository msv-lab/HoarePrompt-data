### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `tt`, and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the input for each test case, which includes the dimensions of the board `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.
   - The function should ideally take these parameters as arguments, but since it reads them from the input within the function, it works for the given problem.

3. **Initial Draw Check:**
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is already in or below Alice's row (`x2 <= x1`). If so, the game is a draw because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row.
   - This check is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Odd Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is odd (`(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`), Alice has the first move and can potentially win if she can move her chip to Bob's position.
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is directly below Bob's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Alice wins.
   - If not, it simulates Alice's and Bob's moves to see if Alice can force a win by moving diagonally to Bob's position.
   - The logic here is somewhat complex and involves adjusting the positions of the chips and checking if Alice can win or if the game ends in a draw.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).

5. **Even Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is even (`(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`), Bob has the first move and can potentially win if he can move his chip to Alice's position.
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is directly above Alice's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Bob wins.
   - If not, it simulates Bob's and Alice's moves to see if Bob can force a win by moving diagonally to Alice's position.
   - The logic here is similar to the odd difference case but adjusted for Bob's moves.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).
   - It also ensures that the new positions of the chips do not go beyond the board boundaries.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game for each test case.
   - The output is consistent with the problem description and the rules of the game.

### Evaluation of Annotated Code:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at key points.
- The annotations confirm that the program follows the logic of the game and handles the conditions and edge cases as described in the problem.
- The annotations also highlight that the function `func_1` should ideally take parameters for the board dimensions and initial chip positions, but since it reads them from the input, it works for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
The program appears to handle all the given conditions and edge cases correctly. It follows the logic of the game and the rules provided in the problem description. The simulation of moves and the checks for winning conditions are implemented appropriately.

Final: **True**
