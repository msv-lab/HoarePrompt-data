The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds` and `n`. `odds` is a list of integers representing the sums of the odd-indexed subarrays of a palindrome array, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000, indicating the size of the array `a`.

The function returns the list `a` where the elements from the middle to the start of the list and their corresponding mirrored positions from the end of the list are set to half the difference between the current and previous elements in `odds`, except for the middle element (if `n` is odd) which is set to the middle element in `odds`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of size `n` where the elements from the middle to the start and their mirrored positions from the end are set to half the difference between consecutive elements in `odds`. If `n` is odd, the middle element of `a` is set to the middle element in `odds`.**
