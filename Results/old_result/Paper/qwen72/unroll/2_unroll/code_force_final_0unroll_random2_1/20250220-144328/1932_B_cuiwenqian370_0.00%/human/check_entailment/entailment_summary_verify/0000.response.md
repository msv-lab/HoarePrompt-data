### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in stating that the provided program does not match the problem description. Let's break down the reasons:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires calculating the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.
   - The signs must occur sequentially, and the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - This function takes a `path` as input, which is a string containing characters `@` and `*`.
     - It uses dynamic programming to calculate a score based on the characters in the path.
     - The function is not related to the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - This function reads input from the standard input and processes it to extract a series of paths.
     - It then applies `func_1` to each path and prints the results.
     - The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, but the test cases it processes are paths, not periodicities of signs.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary for `func_2` confirms that it reads input and processes paths, which are not relevant to the problem of finding the year of the n-th sign.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is designed to solve a different problem entirely. It does not address the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
