The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. Given that `k` is an even integer and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is already at least 2, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

Since `i` is the loop variable and will be initialized by the `range(k)` function, we don't need to adjust `i` explicitly. The loop will start with `i` being 0 and will run `k` times.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as the conditions for `k` are already met. However, for clarity, we can restate the conditions that ensure the loop will execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` must be at least 2**
