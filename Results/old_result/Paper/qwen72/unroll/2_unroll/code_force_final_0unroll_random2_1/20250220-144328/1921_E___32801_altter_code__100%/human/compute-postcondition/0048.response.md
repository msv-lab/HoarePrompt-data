Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + a`.
- `y1` is `r[3] - a` if `y2 <= y1` else `r[3] + a`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is 1 if `y2 <= y1` else `r[1]`.
- `a` is `r[5] - 1` if `y1 >= y2` else `r[1] - r[5]`.
- `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
- `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
- If `y2 <= y1`, `x2` is equal to `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `c` is `y1 - 1`.
- If `y2 > y1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, and `c` is `m - y1`.
- Additionally, either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `a`**:
   - `a` is `r[5] - 1` if `y1 >= y2`.
   - `a` is `r[1] - r[5]` if `y1 < y2`.

2. **Determine `y1`**:
   - `y1` is `r[3] - a` if `y2 <= y1`.
   - `y1` is `r[3] + a` if `y2 > y1`.

3. **Determine `y2`**:
   - `y2` is 1 if `y2 <= y1`.
   - `y2` is `r[1]` if `y2 > y1`.

4. **Determine `x1`**:
   - `x1` is `r[2] + a`.

5. **Determine `x2`**:
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`.

6. **Determine `b`**:
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.

7. **Determine `t`**:
   - `t` is `abs(y2 - y1)`.

8. **Determine `c`**:
   - If `y2 <= y1`, `c` is `y1 - 1`.
   - If `y2 > y1`, `c` is `m - y1`.

9. **Check the Additional Conditions**:
   - Either `b // 2 <= a`, or `abs(x2 - c) < x1 + c`, or `y1 < 1` or `y1 > m`, or `x1 < 1` or `x1 > n`.

### Conclusion:
The `print('draw')` statement will always print the string `'draw'` regardless of the values of the variables because the conditions provided in the initial state are used to determine the values of the variables but do not affect the output of the `print` statement itself.

Output: **draw**
