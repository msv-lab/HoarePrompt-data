Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, k is 0, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` remains unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of test cases.
- The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is used to determine the length of the list `l`.
- The variable `m` remains unchanged as it is used to limit the value of `s`.
- The variable `k` is decremented in each iteration of the inner loop until it reaches 0. Since `k` is always positive and the loop continues until `k` is 0, the final value of `k` will be 0.
- The list `a` (renamed to `l` in the loop) remains unchanged in terms of its elements, but it is sorted in ascending order.
- The variable `c` is updated in each iteration of the inner loop, but its final value is printed and not stored for further use, so it is not part of the output state.
