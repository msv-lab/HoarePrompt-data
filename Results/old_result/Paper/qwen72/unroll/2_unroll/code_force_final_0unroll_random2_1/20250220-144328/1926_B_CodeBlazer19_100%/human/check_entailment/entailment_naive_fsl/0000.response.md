Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify the shapes in all potential cases. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4
1111
0110
0110
0000
```

This input represents a square of size 2 (the 1s form a 2x2 square in the middle of the grid). However, the program will incorrectly output "TRIANGLE" because it only checks if a row contains exactly one '1' to identify a triangle and does not properly check the structure of the square.

The program should be more sophisticated to correctly identify the shapes based on the problem description. It needs to check the structure of the 1s in the grid to determine if they form a triangle or a square, not just the count of 1s in each row.
