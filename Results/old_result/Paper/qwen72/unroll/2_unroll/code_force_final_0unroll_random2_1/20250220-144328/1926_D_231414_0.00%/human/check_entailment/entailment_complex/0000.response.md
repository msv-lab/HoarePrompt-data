### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `func()` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_groups(t, n, a):` where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the number of integers in each test case, and `a` is the list of integers.
   - The function should handle multiple test cases and return the minimum number of groups required for each test case.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `times` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `data`.

3. **Logic for Grouping:**
   - The function uses a dictionary `dic` to keep track of the counts of integers and their XOR with `check` (which is `2 ** 31 - 1` or `11111111111111111111111111111111` in binary).
   - The idea is to use the XOR operation to find pairs of numbers that can be placed in the same group. If `i ^ check` is already in the dictionary, it means `i` and `i ^ check` have complementary bits and can be placed in the same group.
   - However, the logic for updating the dictionary and the answer `ans` is flawed. The variable `ans` is initialized to `n` and is decremented each time a pair is found, but this does not correctly reflect the minimum number of groups required.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result `ans` for each test case, but the result is not correct due to the flawed logic.

### Correctness:
- The function does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of groups required.
- The use of `ans` and the dictionary `dic` is incorrect for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
