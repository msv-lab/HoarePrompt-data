Functionality: ** The function reads a series of inputs from standard input. It processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 5000) and a sorted list `p` of `n` integers (each between -n and n). It then calls `func_1(n, p)` for each test case and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each element in `results`. The function does not return any value, but it modifies the state of the program by reading from standard input and printing the results to the standard output. **
