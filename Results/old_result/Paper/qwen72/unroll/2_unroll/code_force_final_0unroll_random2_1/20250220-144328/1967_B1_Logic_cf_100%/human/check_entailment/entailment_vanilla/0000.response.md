### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input and converts them to integers.

2. **Initial Answer:**
   - The program initializes the answer `ans` to `n`. This is because for every `a` in the range `[1, n]`, the pair `(a, 1)` always satisfies the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, since `gcd(a, 1) = 1` and `a + 1` is always a multiple of `1`.

3. **Loop for `b` from 2 to `min(n, m)`:**
   - The program iterates over `b` from 2 to `min(n, m) + 1`. This is because for `b = 1`, all pairs `(a, 1)` are already counted in the initial answer.
   - For each `b`, it calculates the number of valid `a` values using the expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` and adds this to `ans`.

4. **Expression Analysis:**
   - The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is intended to count the number of valid `a` values for a given `b`.
   - However, this expression is incorrect. The correct condition to check is whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The given expression does not correctly implement this condition.

5. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition should be checked using the greatest common divisor (gcd) function. Specifically, for each `b`, we need to count the number of `a` values such that `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
   - The current implementation does not use the gcd function and instead uses a simple division, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the condition specified in the problem. The expression `(n + b) // (b * b)` is not equivalent to checking whether `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Correctness:
**False**
