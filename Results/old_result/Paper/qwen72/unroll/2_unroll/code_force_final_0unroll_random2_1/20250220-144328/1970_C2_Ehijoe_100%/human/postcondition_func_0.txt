The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `nodes` representing the adjacency list of a tree, an integer `start` within the range of the tree's nodes, and an optional integer `parent` also within the range of the tree's nodes. It returns `False` if the node at `start` has only one adjacent node and that node is `parent`. Otherwise, it recursively checks the distance of each adjacent node (excluding `parent`) from the current node. The function returns `True` if any of these recursive checks return `False`, indicating that there is at least one path from the `start` node to a leaf node that does not include `parent`. If all recursive checks return `True`, the function returns `False`.
