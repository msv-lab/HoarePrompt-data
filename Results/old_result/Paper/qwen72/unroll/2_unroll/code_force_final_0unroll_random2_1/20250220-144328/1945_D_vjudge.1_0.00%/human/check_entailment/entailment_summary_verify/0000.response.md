### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1()`
- **Input:**
  - `n` and `k` are read from the input, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position for Kirill, respectively.
  - `lista_A` and `lista_B` are lists of integers read from the input, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person and the cost to move past the i-th person, respectively.
  - Both lists are reversed to facilitate the algorithm's logic.

- **Logic:**
  - `soma_b` is initialized to 0, representing the cumulative cost of moving past people.
  - `pref` is initialized to 0, representing the total cost of bribing people to move to a position.
  - The loop iterates from 0 to `n - k - 1`:
    - If `lista_A[i]` (cost to bribe the i-th person) is less than `lista_B[i]` (cost to move past the i-th person), Kirill bribes the i-th person, and the cumulative cost `soma_b` is reset.
    - Otherwise, the cumulative cost `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`.
  - After the loop, `resultado` is initialized to infinity.
  - Another loop iterates from `n - k` to `n - 1`:
    - `resultado` is updated to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
    - `soma_b` is increased by `lista_B[i]`.
  - Finally, `resultado` is printed.

#### Function 2: `func_2()`
- **Input:**
  - `numero_testes` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.
- **Logic:**
  - The function iterates `numero_testes` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
- **Output:**
  - No value is returned, but the results of `func_1()` are printed for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `m`. Specifically, it claims that when `n == m`, Kirill should not need to spend any coins, but the program will incorrectly calculate the cost.

#### Analysis:
- **Case `n == m`:**
  - When `n == m`, the loop `for i in range(n - k)` will not execute because `n - k` will be 0. This means `pref` will remain 0.
  - The second loop `for i in range(n - k, n)` will iterate from 0 to `n - 1` (inclusive), which is the entire range of the list.
  - In this loop, `resultado` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`.
  - Since `pref` and `soma_b` are both 0, `resultado` will be the minimum value of `lista_A` from `n - k` to `n - 1`, which is the entire list.
  - Therefore, `resultado` will be the minimum value in `lista_A`, which is the cost to bribe the person at the last position (Kirill's initial position).

- **Example Input:**
  ```
  1
  2 2
  2 3
  1 1
  ```
  - `n = 2`, `k = 2`
  - `lista_A = [3, 2]` (reversed)
  - `lista_B = [1, 1]` (reversed)
  - The first loop does not execute.
  - The second loop iterates once:
    - `i = 0`
    - `resultado = min(resultado, 0 + 0 + 3) = 3`
    - `soma_b += 1` (soma_b = 1)
  - The final output is 3, which is incorrect. Kirill should not need to spend any coins because he is already in the first 2 positions.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where `n` is equal to `m` correctly. When `n == m`, Kirill should not need to spend any coins, but the program will incorrectly calculate the cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
