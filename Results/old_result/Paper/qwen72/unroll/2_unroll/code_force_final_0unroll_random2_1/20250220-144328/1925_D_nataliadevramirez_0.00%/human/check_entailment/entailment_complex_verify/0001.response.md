### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is 0 and does not change.
   - The answer should be given as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in any given excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair over `k` excursions is \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} i \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Sum of the First `k` Natural Numbers:**
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value for Each Pair:**
   - For each pair of friends with an initial friendship value \( f_i \), the expected value of the sum of their friendship values over `k` excursions is \( f_i \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

5. **Total Expected Value:**
   - The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs of friends.
   - Therefore, the total expected value is \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The final result should be computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) can be precomputed as \( \frac{2}{n \cdot (n-1)} \).

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of \( f_i \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) for all pairs of friends.
     - It does not account for the probability term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
     - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

   - **Function 2:**
     - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

8. **Missing Probability Term:**
   - The program is missing the term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) in the expected value calculation.
   - The correct expected value should be \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{n \cdot (n-1)} \).

9. **Modular Inverse:**
   - To compute \( \frac{2}{n \cdot (n-1)} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), we need to use the modular inverse of \( n \cdot (n-1) \).

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The given program does not account for the probability term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) in the expected value calculation, which is essential for the correct solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
