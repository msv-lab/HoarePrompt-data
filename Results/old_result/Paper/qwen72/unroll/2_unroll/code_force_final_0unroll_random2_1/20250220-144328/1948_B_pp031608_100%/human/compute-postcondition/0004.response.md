Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `m` and a list of `m` integers `arr`. The function then checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. If it can, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function performs this check for each of the `n` test cases. The state of the program remains unchanged with respect to any external variables like `t` or `a` that might have been present before the function call. **
