Output State: **The values of `t`, `n`, and `loop` remain unchanged. The variables `less`, `big`, and `no` are reset to empty lists for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `num` is calculated and printed for each iteration, but its value is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.**
