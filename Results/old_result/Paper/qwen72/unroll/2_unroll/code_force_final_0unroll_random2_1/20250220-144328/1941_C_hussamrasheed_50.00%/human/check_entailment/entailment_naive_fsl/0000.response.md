Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the removal of characters to make the string beautiful. Specifically, the program only counts and removes occurrences of the exact substrings "map" and "pie" but does not consider the minimum number of deletions required to avoid these substrings. For example, in the string "mmapnapie", the program will count one "map" and one "pie" and output 2, but the correct answer should be 3, as removing the 4th, 5th, and 9th characters will make the string beautiful. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
