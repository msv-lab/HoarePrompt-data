Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `t` with the value of `b`.
   - It then calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons. If `b` is even, `t` is set to `b // 2`. If `b` is odd, `t` is set to `b // 2 + 1`. This is because each screen can hold up to 2 2x2 icons, and if there is an odd number of 2x2 icons, one additional screen is needed.

3. **Remaining Space Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `t1` as `t * 15 - b * 4`. This is the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.
   - If `t1` is greater than or equal to `a`, it means there is enough space to place all the 1x1 icons on the screens already allocated for the 2x2 icons, so the program does not need to add more screens.

4. **Additional Screens Calculation**:
   - If `t1` is less than `a`, the program calculates the additional number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
   - `t2` is the number of 1x1 icons that still need to be placed, which is `a - t1`.
   - The program then adds the necessary number of screens to `t`. If `t2` is a multiple of 15, it adds `t2 // 15` screens. Otherwise, it adds `t2 // 15 + 1` screens to ensure all 1x1 icons are placed.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens needed for each test case.

**Issues**:
- The program is using the variable `t` to represent both the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons and the total number of screens needed. This can be confusing, but it works as intended.
- The calculation `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4` is correct for determining the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons.
- The logic for adding additional screens for the 1x1 icons is also correct.

However, there is a potential issue with the variable naming and the clarity of the code. The variable `t` is reused in a way that might not be immediately clear. Additionally, the comments provided are misleading, as they mention "15-minute intervals" which is not relevant to the problem.

Despite these issues, the logic of the program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description and input constraints.

Correctness: **True**
