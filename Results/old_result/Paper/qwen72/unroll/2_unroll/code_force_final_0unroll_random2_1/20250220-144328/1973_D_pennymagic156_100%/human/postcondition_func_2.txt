The function `func_3` accepts no parameters and returns an iterator that yields integer values from a string of space-separated numbers provided by the user. The user's input is split into individual number strings, and each string is converted to an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned an iterator, and the user can iterate over this iterator to access the integer values.
