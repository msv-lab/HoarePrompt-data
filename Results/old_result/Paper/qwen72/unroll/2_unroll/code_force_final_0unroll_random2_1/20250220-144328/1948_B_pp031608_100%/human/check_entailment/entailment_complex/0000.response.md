### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `m` and the array `arr` itself.

2. **Logic for Checking Non-Decreasing Order:**
   - The function iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous element.
   - If it finds such a pair, it attempts to split the previous element into its digits and checks if the resulting list of digits plus the current element is sorted.
   - If the resulting list is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where the array is already sorted.
   - It also handles the case where the array contains elements that are less than 10, as these elements cannot be split further.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'YES' if the array can be made non-decreasing by the described operations, and 'NO' otherwise.

5. **Potential Issues:**
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting one element is not entirely correct. Specifically, the function only checks if the digits of the element and the next element can be sorted, but it does not consider the entire array after the split.
   - For example, in the test case `[12, 28, 5]`, the function will split `12` into `[1, 2]` and check if `[1, 2, 28, 5]` can be sorted, which it cannot. However, the function should also consider if splitting `28` into `[2, 8]` and then checking the entire array could make it sorted.

### Correctness:
Given the issues in the logic for checking the non-decreasing order, the function is not correct for all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
