Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem in all cases. Here are the main issues:

1. **Handling of `-1` and `1` Conversion:**
   - The program attempts to handle the conversion of `1` to `-1` and vice versa, but it does so in a way that can lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the logic for converting `1` to `-1` and adjusting the subsequent bits is not robust enough to handle all edge cases.

2. **Length Calculation:**
   - The program initializes `length` to 30, which is not always correct. The length of the array should be determined based on the number of bits required to represent `x` in binary, plus any additional bits needed to handle the `-1` and `1` conversions.

3. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - The program uses bitwise operations to determine the bits of `x`, but it does not correctly handle the conversion of `1` to `-1` and the propagation of this change through the array.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - The final adjustments to the array (where `s[i] == '-1'` and `s[i - 1] == '1'`) are not applied correctly, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
1. Convert the integer `x` to its binary representation.
2. Ensure that no two consecutive bits are both `1` by converting `1` to `-1` and adjusting the subsequent bits accordingly.
3. Determine the correct length of the array based on the number of bits required and the adjustments made.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        carry = 0
        for i in range(30):
            bit = (x >> i) & 1
            if bit == 1 and carry == 0:
                s.append(1)
                carry = 0
            elif bit == 1 and carry == 1:
                s.append(-1)
                carry = 1
            elif bit == 0 and carry == 1:
                s.append(1)
                carry = 1
            else:
                s.append(0)
                carry = 0
        if carry == 1:
            s.append(1)
        
        # Remove leading zeros
        while s and s[-1] == 0:
            s.pop()
        
        n = len(s)
        print(n)
        print(*s[::-1])

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Bitwise Operations:**
   - The program uses bitwise operations to extract each bit of `x` and determine the corresponding value in the array `s`.
   - It keeps track of a `carry` to handle the conversion of `1` to `-1` and the propagation of this change.

2. **Carry Handling:**
   - If a bit is `1` and there is no carry, it is added as `1`.
   - If a bit is `1` and there is a carry, it is added as `-1` and the carry is set to `1`.
   - If a bit is `0` and there is a carry, it is added as `1` and the carry is set to `1`.
   - If a bit is `0` and there is no carry, it is added as `0`.

3. **Final Adjustments:**
   - If there is a carry left after processing all bits, an additional `1` is appended to the array.
   - Leading zeros are removed to ensure the array length is minimized.

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the array `n` is printed.
   - The array `s` is printed in reverse order to match the required format.

This corrected program should handle all test cases correctly.
