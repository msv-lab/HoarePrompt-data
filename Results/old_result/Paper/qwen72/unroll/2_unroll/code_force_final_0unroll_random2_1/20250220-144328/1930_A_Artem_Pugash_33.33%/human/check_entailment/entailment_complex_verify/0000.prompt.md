You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = input().split()
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        suma = 0
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, and a is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7.
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        
        numbers = input().split()
        
        numbers.sort(reverse=False)
        
        suma = 0
        
        while numbers != []:
            a = int(numbers.pop(0))
            b = int(numbers.pop(0))
            suma += min(a, b)
        
        print(suma)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `numCases` is an input integer. After the loop, `numCases` is 0, `numbers` is an empty list, and `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list `numbers` for each case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a series of test cases from the user input. For each test case, it reads a number of integers, sorts them in non-decreasing order, and then repeatedly pairs the integers, summing the smaller integer of each pair. The function prints the sum for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function terminates without returning any value. The final state of the program is that `numCases` is 0, `numbers` is an empty list, and `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list `numbers` for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for all potential cases:

1. **Sorting the List of Strings**: The program sorts the list of numbers as strings, which can lead to incorrect sorting. For example, if the input is `10 2 1`, it will be sorted as `['1', '10', '2']` instead of `[1, 2, 10]`. This can cause the program to select the wrong pairs and compute an incorrect score.

2. **Converting to Integers**: The program converts the numbers to integers after popping them from the list, but it should convert them to integers before sorting to ensure the correct order.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the input might not be valid, such as if the number of integers is not exactly 2n.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    numCases = int(input())
    for i in range(numCases):
        numInteger = int(input())
        numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
        numbers.sort()
        suma = 0
        for j in range(numInteger):
            a = numbers.pop(0)
            b = numbers.pop(0)
            suma += min(a, b)
        print(suma)
```

This corrected version ensures that the numbers are converted to integers before sorting, and it correctly handles the pairs to compute the maximum score.
