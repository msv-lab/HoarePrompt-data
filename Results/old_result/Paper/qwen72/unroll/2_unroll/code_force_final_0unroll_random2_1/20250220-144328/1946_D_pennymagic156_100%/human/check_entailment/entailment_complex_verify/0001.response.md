### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program uses `func_3` to read `n` and `x` from the input.
   - It uses `func_1` to read the array `a` from the input.
   - The main function `func_5` is correctly structured to handle multiple test cases.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the bits of `x` from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 (`u == 0`).
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is odd (`v % 2`), it returns `-1` because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is even, it tries to split the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 (`u == 1`):
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is even (`v % 2 == 0`), it continues to the next bit.
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is odd (`v % 2`), it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0 and updates the answer.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is 0, it breaks the loop.

3. **Segment Splitting**:
   - The program uses a variable `op` to keep track of the XOR of the `i`-th bits of the current segment.
   - It uses `ai` to keep track of the cumulative XOR of the values in the current segment.
   - When `op` becomes 0, it means the current segment can be split, and it appends `ai` to the list `t` and resets `ai`.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - After processing all bits, the program returns the maximum value between the current `ans` and the length of the array `a`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Bitwise Operations**:
  - The bitwise operations `x >> i & 1` and `val >> i & 1` are correctly used to extract the `i`-th bit of `x` and `val`, respectively.
  - The sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is correctly calculated using `sum([(val >> i & 1) for val in a])`.

- **Segment Splitting**:
  - When `u == 0` and `v % 2 == 0`, the program correctly attempts to split the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0.
  - The use of `op` and `ai` ensures that the segments are correctly identified and stored in `t`.

- **Handling Odd Sum**:
  - When `u == 0` and `v % 2 != 0`, the program correctly returns `-1` because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.

- **Handling Even Sum**:
  - When `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0`, the program correctly continues to the next bit.
  - When `u == 1` and `v % 2 != 0`, the program correctly counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0 and updates the answer.

- **Final Return**:
  - The program returns the maximum value between `ans` and the length of the modified array `a`, which is the correct final step.
