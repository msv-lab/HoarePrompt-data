Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The key to solving this problem is understanding the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, the player who starts (Alice) will be the one to remove the last facing-up coin and win. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even, the player who starts (Alice) will be the one to face the situation where there are no facing-up coins left, and thus she will lose.

However, the function `func_2` in the provided program returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters (facing-up coins) is even, and 'NO' if it is odd. This is the opposite of what the problem requires. The function should return 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters is odd, and 'NO' if it is even.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.

Correctness: **False**
