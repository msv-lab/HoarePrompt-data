### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It then reads `n` rows of `m` integers each, representing the depths of the river cells.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is responsible for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row.
   - It first increments the first `d-1` elements of the row by 1, which is correct because the cost of installing a support in these cells is `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - For the remaining elements, it calculates the cost as the minimum of the previous `d` elements plus 1. This ensures that the distance between any pair of adjacent supports is no more than `d`.
   - The function returns the last element of the row, which is the total cost of installing supports for that row.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It calculates the cost of installing supports for each row using `func_1`.
   - It then computes the total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges by summing the costs of `k` consecutive rows.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum of these total costs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, ensuring that the first and last elements of each row are 0.
   - The program also ensures that the distance between supports is no more than `d`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the given constraints, especially since the sum of `n * m` for all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for solving the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each row to find the minimum cost of installing supports, and then finds the minimum total cost for building `k` consecutive bridges.
