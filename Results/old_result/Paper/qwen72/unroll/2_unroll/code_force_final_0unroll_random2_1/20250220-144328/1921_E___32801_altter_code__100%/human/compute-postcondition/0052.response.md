The provided code snippet contains a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'bob'`. The initial state describes the setup of a function and some variables, but these variables and the function itself are not used in the `print` statement. Therefore, the output of the `print` statement is solely determined by the string `'bob'`.

Output: **bob**
