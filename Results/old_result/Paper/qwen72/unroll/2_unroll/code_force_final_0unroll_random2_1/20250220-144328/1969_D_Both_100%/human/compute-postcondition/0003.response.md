The function `func_4` does not accept any direct parameters. Instead, it relies on the outputs from `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` is expected to return the number of test cases, and `func_2` is expected to return a tuple containing two integers (n, k) and lists of integers representing item prices and bonuses. The function `func_4` processes these inputs and returns a result based on the provided test cases, item prices, and bonuses.

Functionality: **The function `func_4` relies on the outputs from `func_1` and `func_2` to process test cases, item prices, and bonuses, and returns a result based on this data.**
