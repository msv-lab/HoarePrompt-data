To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is not an empty list. Let's break down the state and determine what needs to be adjusted:

- `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`.
- `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`.
- `index` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each `path` in the input, where `path` is the string at every second position starting from index 1 in the `data` list.

For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. This means that there must be at least one `path` in `data` starting from index 1 that `func_1` can process. 

Given the state:
- `data` must be a list with at least `1 + 2 * t` elements.
- `t` must be a non-negative integer.
- `index` must be a valid index within `data`.

To ensure `results` is not empty, `data` must have at least one path starting from index 1. This means `t` must be at least 1 (since `index` is `1 + 2 * t`).

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin` and must have at least `3` elements (to ensure `t` is at least 1 and there is at least one path), `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be at least 1, `index` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(path)` for each `path` in the input, where `path` is the string at every second position starting from index 1 in the `data` list and must have at least one element.**
