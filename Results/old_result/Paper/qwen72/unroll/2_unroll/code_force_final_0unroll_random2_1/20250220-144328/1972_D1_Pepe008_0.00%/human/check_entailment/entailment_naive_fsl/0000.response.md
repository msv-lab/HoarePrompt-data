Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the condition where `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The logic in the program is flawed, and it does not count the valid pairs correctly. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
For the input `n = 2` and `m = 3`, the valid pairs are:
- (1, 1): \(1 + 1 = 2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
- (2, 1): \(2 + 1 = 3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
- (2, 2): \(2 + 2 = 4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).

The program should output 3, but it outputs 2, indicating that it is not correctly counting the valid pairs.
