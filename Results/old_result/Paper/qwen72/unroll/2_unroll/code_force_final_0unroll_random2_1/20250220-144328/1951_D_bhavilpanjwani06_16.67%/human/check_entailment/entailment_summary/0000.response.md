Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.

2. **Base Case Checks**:
   - If `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO" because Alice does not have enough coins to buy the required number of jewels.
   - If `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES" followed by "1" and `n`. This is valid because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels from a single stall priced at `n` coins each, spending all her coins and buying exactly `k` jewels.

3. **Greedy Approach**:
   - The program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition is intended to determine if it is possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `k - 1 < n - k + 1`, the program prints "YES" followed by "2" and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`. This is correct because:
     - Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall priced at `n - k + 1` coins each.
     - Alice will then have `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins left, which should be at least `1` coin.
     - Alice will buy the remaining `1` jewel from the second stall priced at `1` coin each.
   - If `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`, the program prints "NO". This is incorrect because it does not consider other possible configurations of stalls and prices that could still allow Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels.

4. **Missing Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where `k` is much smaller than `n` and more than two stalls are needed. For example, if `n = 100` and `k = 3`, the program might incorrectly print "NO" when a valid solution exists (e.g., setting up 3 stalls with prices `33`, `33`, and `34`).

5. **General Solution**:
   - A more general approach would be to set up `k` stalls, each priced at `1` coin, and then set up an additional stall with a price of `n - k + 1` coins to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. This would always work as long as `n >= k`.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where a valid solution exists.

Correctness: **False**
