Output State: **`i` is the value at which the loop returns, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, and `v` remains unchanged.**

The function `func_2()` is called, but since the function definition is not provided, it is not possible to determine how it affects the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
