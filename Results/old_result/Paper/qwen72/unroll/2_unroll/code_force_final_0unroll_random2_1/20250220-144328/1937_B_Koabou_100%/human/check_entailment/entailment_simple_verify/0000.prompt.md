You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the binary strings are of length `n` and consist of characters '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

#### Test Case:
```
1
4
0101
1010
```

#### Expected Output:
```
0000
2
```

#### Actual Output:
```
0101
1
```

### Analysis:
1. **Finding the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program attempts to find the lexicographically smallest string by comparing the values of the grid cells and making decisions based on those comparisons.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the top row and the bottom row both have the same value at a certain column, and the optimal path involves choosing the top row initially and then switching to the bottom row at a later column.

2. **Counting the Number of Paths:**
   - The program's logic for counting the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string is flawed.
   - It does not correctly account for all possible paths that can yield the same lexicographically smallest string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to:
1. **Find the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - Start from the top-left cell and always choose the cell with the smaller value (0 or 1) when moving right or down.
   - If both cells have the same value, continue moving in the current direction (right or down).

2. **Count the Number of Paths:**
   - Keep track of the number of ways to reach each cell that results in the lexicographically smallest string.
   - Use dynamic programming to count the number of paths efficiently.

### Example of a Correct Solution:
```python
def solve():
    n = int(input())
    a = [input() for _ in range(2)]
    
    # Initialize the result string and the path count
    result = []
    path_count = 1
    x, y = 0, 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Determine the next cell to move to
        if i < n - 1:
            if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i + 1] == '1':
                result.append(a[0][i + 1])
                y = 0
            elif a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i + 1] == '0':
                result.append(a[1][i + 1])
                y = 1
            else:
                result.append(a[y][i + 1])
                if a[0][i + 1] == a[1][i + 1]:
                    path_count *= 2
        else:
            result.append(a[1][i])
    
    # Print the result and the path count
    print(''.join(result))
    print(path_count)

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    solve()
```

This solution correctly finds the lexicographically smallest string and counts the number of paths that yield this string for all potential cases.
