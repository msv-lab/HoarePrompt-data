Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the movement of the pinball according to the rules specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not simulate the pinball's movement step by step, nor does it account for the inversion of the direction characters (`<` and `>`) after each move. Instead, it uses a complex series of calculations that do not clearly correspond to the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3
>><
```
Expected Output:
```
3 4 1
```
The program's output for this case is incorrect. Let's break down the expected behavior:

1. **For i = 1 (first cell):**
   - Initial grid: `>><`
   - Pinball moves right to the second cell: `><>`
   - Pinball moves right to the third cell: `><<`
   - Pinball moves left to the second cell: `<><`
   - Pinball moves left to the first cell: `<<>`
   - Pinball moves left and leaves the grid.
   - Total time: 3 seconds.

2. **For i = 2 (second cell):**
   - Initial grid: `>><`
   - Pinball moves right to the third cell: `>><`
   - Pinball moves left to the second cell: `>><`
   - Pinball moves left to the first cell: `>><`
   - Pinball moves left and leaves the grid.
   - Total time: 4 seconds.

3. **For i = 3 (third cell):**
   - Initial grid: `>><`
   - Pinball moves left to the second cell: `>><`
   - Pinball moves left to the first cell: `>><`
   - Pinball moves left and leaves the grid.
   - Total time: 1 second.

The program does not simulate these movements and inversions correctly, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
