Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then identifies two elements `a` and `b` from the list `l` and counts the number of elements in `l` that satisfy certain conditions relative to `a` and `b`. The function prints the count `c` for each test case. The function does not return any value. The variables `t`, `n`, and `l` are re-initialized for each test case, so their values do not persist across test cases. **
