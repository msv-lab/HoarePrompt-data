### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a hidden array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` satisfies `1 ≤ a_i ≤ n`.
   - We need to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each having the same value of `f(l, r) = (r - l + 1) * max(a_l, ..., a_r)`.
   - If no such `m` exists, we should output `-1`.

2. **Interactive Queries**:
   - We can ask up to `2n` queries of the form `? l x` to find the smallest `r` such that `f(l, r) = x`.
   - The response will be `r` if such an `r` exists, or `n + 1` if it does not.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - **Function 1**: `func_1()` reads a list of integers from input. This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function 2**: `func_2()` reads a single integer from input. This is used to read the responses to our queries.
   - **Function 3**: `func_3()` reads two integers from input. This is used to read the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - **Function 4**: `func_4()` reads a string from input and strips it. This function is not used in the main logic.
   - **Function 5**: `func_5()` is the main function that handles the logic for each test case.

4. **Main Logic in `func_5`**:
   - **Step 1**: The function reads `n` and `k` using `func_3()`.
   - **Step 2**: It initializes `v` to 1 and iterates from `n` down to `1`. For each `i`, it queries `? 1 (i * n)` and checks if the response `v` is equal to `n`. If so, it sets `v` to `i` and breaks the loop.
     - This step is trying to find the largest possible value of `m` by checking the maximum possible `f(l, r)` for the entire array.
   - **Step 3**: It then iterates from `1` to `n // k + 1` to find a valid `m` by checking if the array can be split into `k` subarrays each having `f(l, r) = i * v`.
     - For each `i`, it initializes `cnt` to `k` and `l` to `1`.
     - It asks queries `? l (i * v)` and updates `l` to `func_2() + 1` and decrements `cnt`.
     - If `cnt` reaches `0` and `l` is `n + 1`, it means we have successfully split the array into `k` subarrays each having `f(l, r) = i * v`. It prints `! (i * v)` and returns.
   - **Step 4**: If no valid `m` is found, it prints `! -1` and returns.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the input and output for the interactive problem.
   - The logic for finding the largest `m` by checking the maximum possible `f(l, r)` for the entire array and then verifying if the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the same `f(l, r)` is sound.
   - The program ensures that it does not exceed the query limit of `2n` by carefully managing the number of queries.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The initial loop to find `v` by iterating from `n` down to `1` and querying `? 1 (i * n)` is correct in finding the maximum possible `f(l, r)` for the entire array.
   - However, the subsequent loop to find a valid `m` by iterating from `1` to `n // k + 1` and querying `? l (i * v)` might not be efficient or correct in all cases.
   - Specifically, the condition `if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` might not always correctly identify a valid split. For example, if the array is such that the maximum value is not uniformly distributed, the program might miss valid splits.

7. **Verification**:
   - The function summary for `func_5` indicates that it performs a series of queries and checks conditions to find a valid `m`.
   - The summary confirms that the function correctly handles the interactive nature of the problem and the query limit.
   - However, the summary does not provide a detailed breakdown of the logic, which is necessary to fully verify the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is mostly correct based on the problem description and the constraints. However, the logic for verifying the splits might not be robust enough in all cases. The program should be tested with a variety of edge cases to ensure its correctness.

Final: **False**
