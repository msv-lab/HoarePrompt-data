Output State: **The function will print the time in 12-hour format followed by 'AM' or 'PM' for each iteration of the loop, based on the input time and the value of `day`. The variables `h`, `m`, and `day` will be updated for each iteration, but the initial state of `s`, `t`, and `n` will remain unchanged. The final values of `h`, `m`, and `day` will depend on the last input time and the number of iterations `n`.**
