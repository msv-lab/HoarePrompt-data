Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` consists of only one unique character, it prints 'NO'. If the string `s` has more than one unique character, it prints 'YES', followed by either the lexicographically smallest or largest sorted version of `s` depending on whether `s` is already in lexicographically smallest order. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the variable `n` remains unchanged, and `s` holds the last input string read. **
