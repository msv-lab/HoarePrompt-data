Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and a list `l` of `n` integers. It then processes these inputs to compute a value `c` based on the sorted list `l`, the values of `m` and `k`, and prints the integer value of `c`. After processing all test cases, `k` is set to 0 for each test case, and the function has no return value. **
