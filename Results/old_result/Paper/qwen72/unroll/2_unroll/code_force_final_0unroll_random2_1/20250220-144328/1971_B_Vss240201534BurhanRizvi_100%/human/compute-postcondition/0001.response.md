Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. Each of the t test cases has been processed, and for each test case, if the string s had a length of 1 or all characters were the same, "No" was printed. Otherwise, "Yes" was printed followed by a shuffled version of s (or a modified version if the shuffle resulted in the same string). The variable s is undefined or reset for each iteration, and the loop has completed all t iterations.**
