The function operates in an interactive environment to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it finds and outputs two indices `i` and `j` from a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, such that the XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. The function makes at most 3n queries to the environment to determine these indices. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value but has printed the results for each test case in the format `! {prev} {v1}`, where `prev` and `v1` are the indices found.
