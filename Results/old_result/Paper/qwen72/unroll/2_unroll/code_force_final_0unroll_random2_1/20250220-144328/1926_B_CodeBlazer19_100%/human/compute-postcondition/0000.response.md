The value of `t` is assigned the integer value obtained from the `input()` function. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The function should accept a 2D list `grid` of size n x n where each element is either '0' or '1', and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1. `t` is an input integer.
