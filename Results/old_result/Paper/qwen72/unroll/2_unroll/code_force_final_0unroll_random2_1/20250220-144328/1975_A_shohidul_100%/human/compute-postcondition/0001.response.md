The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 1000, `_` is a placeholder**
