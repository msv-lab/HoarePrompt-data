The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `p`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000.
- `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` satisfies |p_i| <= n and the list is sorted in non-decreasing order (p_1 <= p_2 <= ... <= p_n).

The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, we can only describe the parameters and the general expectation that the function will return some value based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000), `n` (an integer between 1 and 5000), and `p` (a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer is between -n and n). The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not described.**
