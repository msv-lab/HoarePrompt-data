Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in how it calculates the number of triangles that can be formed. The program only counts the number of gaps of size 1 between the chosen vertices and adds a fixed number of triangles based on the number of chosen vertices. However, this approach is too simplistic and does not consider the actual geometry of the polygon or the correct way to form non-intersecting triangles.

### Correct Approach:

1. **Identify the Chosen Vertices**: The vertices chosen by Bessie are given in the input. These vertices are used to form the diagonals.

2. **Count the Gaps**: The gaps between the chosen vertices are crucial. Each gap of size 2 or more can be used to form additional triangles by connecting the vertices within the gap.

3. **Calculate the Maximum Number of Triangles**:
   - For each gap of size \( k \) (where \( k \geq 2 \)), you can form \( k - 1 \) triangles.
   - Additionally, the number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices themselves is \( x - 2 \).

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        # Add a virtual vertex to handle the wrap-around
        list0.append(list0[0] + n)
        
        count = 0
        for i in range(x):
            gap = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if gap >= 2:
                count += gap - 1
        
        # Add the triangles formed by the chosen vertices
        count += x - 2
        
        print(count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and the details of each test case.
2. **Gap Calculation**: It sorts the chosen vertices and adds a virtual vertex to handle the wrap-around (i.e., the gap between the last and the first vertex).
3. **Triangle Counting**:
   - For each gap of size \( k \) (where \( k \geq 2 \)), it adds \( k - 1 \) to the count.
   - It also adds \( x - 2 \) to the count to account for the triangles formed by the chosen vertices themselves.

This approach ensures that the program correctly counts the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.
