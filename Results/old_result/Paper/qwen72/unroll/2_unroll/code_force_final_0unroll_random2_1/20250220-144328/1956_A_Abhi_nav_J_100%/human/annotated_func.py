#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of k integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100, b is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100.
def func_1(a, b):
    if (a <= b) :
        return a - 1
        #The program returns an error because the operation `a - 1` is not valid for a list.
    else :
        return b
        #The program returns the list 'b', which is a list of q integers where 1 ≤ q ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. `a` is a list of `k` integers where `1 ≤ k ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100`, and `b` is a list of `q` integers where `1 ≤ q ≤ 100` and `1 ≤ b_i ≤ 100`. The function returns an error if the condition `a <= b` is true because the operation `a - 1` is not valid for a list. Otherwise, it returns the list `b` unchanged.
