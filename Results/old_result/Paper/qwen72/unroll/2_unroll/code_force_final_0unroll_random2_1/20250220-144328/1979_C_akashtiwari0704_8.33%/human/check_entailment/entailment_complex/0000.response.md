Reasoning:

The program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the product of all multipliers and then distributing the coins such that the bet for each outcome is the product divided by the corresponding multiplier. This approach is flawed because:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Bets**: The product of all multipliers is used to determine the bets. However, the sum of these bets (product divided by each multiplier) is always going to be equal to the product, not strictly less than the product. This violates the condition that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

2. **Sum Condition**: The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the product. Since the sum of the bets is always equal to the product, this condition will always be true, leading to the program printing `-1` for all test cases where the product is not zero.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if all multipliers are the same, the product divided by each multiplier will result in the same bet for each outcome, and the sum of these bets will be equal to the product, leading to an incorrect `-1` output.

4. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve finding a set of bets such that the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the sum of the bets multiplied by their respective multipliers. This can be achieved by setting the bets in such a way that the sum of the bets is just slightly less than the minimum of the multipliers.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
