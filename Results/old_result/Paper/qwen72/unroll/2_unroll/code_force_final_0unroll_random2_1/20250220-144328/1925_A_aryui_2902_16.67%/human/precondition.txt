The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 676) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 26) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 26), where n is the length of the strings to be formed and k is the number of the first lowercase English alphabets to be used.
