You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The array a contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The array b contains m integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_m where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    nabors = int(input())
    for _ in range(nabors):
        n, m, k = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        aa = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        bb = [str(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        cnt_aa = Counter(aa[:m])
        
        cnt_bb = Counter(bb)
        
        D = cnt_aa & cnt_bb
        
        pairs_in_D = sum(D.values())
        
        E = cnt_aa - D
        
        C = cnt_bb - D
        
        fnd = 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        for in_aa, out_aa in zip(aa[m:], aa[:n - m]):
            if D[out_aa] > 0:
                if E[out_aa] > 0:
                    E[out_aa] -= 1
                else:
                    D[out_aa] -= 1
                    pairs_in_D -= 1
                    C[out_aa] += 1
            else:
                E[out_aa] -= 1
            if C[in_aa] > 0:
                D[in_aa] += 1
                pairs_in_D += 1
                C[in_aa] -= 1
            else:
                E[in_aa] += 1
            fnd += 1 if pairs_in_D >= k else 0
        
        print(fnd)
        
    #State: The variable `fnd` will contain the number of times the condition `pairs_in_D >= k` is true during the execution of the loop. The arrays `aa` and `bb` will remain unchanged. The variables `cnt_aa`, `cnt_bb`, `D`, `E`, and `C` will be updated based on the operations within the loop, but their final states are not explicitly defined in the output. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` will be overwritten in each iteration of the loop, but their final values will be the last input values read.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and two arrays `a` and `b`. It returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters and arrays, with the number of test cases `t` ranging from 1 to 10^4 and the sum of `n` and `m` over all test cases not exceeding 2 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
