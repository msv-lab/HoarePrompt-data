### Reasoning:

The original assessment is correct in identifying the flaw in the program. Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - Each pair of children has an equal probability of being chosen in each excursion.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the result as `f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD` for each friendship.
   - This formula assumes that each pair of friends will be chosen in every excursion, which is incorrect.

3. **Correct Calculation**:
   - The correct approach should consider the probability of each pair being chosen in each excursion.
   - The number of possible pairs of children is \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\).
   - The probability of choosing a specific pair (a, b) in any given excursion is \(\frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of a specific pair (a, b) over \(k\) excursions is \(\frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\).
   - Therefore, the expected value for a pair (a, b) with initial friendship value \(f\) over \(k\) excursions is:
     \[
     f \times \left(1 + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}}\right)
     \]
   - This value should be summed over all pairs and taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case:
     ```
     1
     3 1 2
     1 2 1
     ```
   - There are 3 children, 1 pair of friends (1, 2) with an initial friendship value of 1, and 2 excursions.
   - The number of possible pairs is \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\).
   - The probability of choosing the pair (1, 2) in each excursion is \(\frac{1}{3}\).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value of (1, 2) over 2 excursions is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3}
     \]
   - The expected total sum of friendship values is:
     \[
     1 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{5}{3}
     \]
   - However, the program calculates:
     \[
     1 \times \left(\frac{2 \times (2 + 1)}{2}\right) = 1 \times 3 = 3
     \]
   - This is incorrect.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation in `func_1` does not correctly account for the probability of each pair being chosen.
   - The correct approach should involve calculating the expected value for each pair and summing these expected values.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
