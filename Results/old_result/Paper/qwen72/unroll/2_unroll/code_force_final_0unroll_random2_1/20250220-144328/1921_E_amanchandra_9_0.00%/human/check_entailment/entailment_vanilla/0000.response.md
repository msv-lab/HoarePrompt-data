### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for Draw Condition:**
   - The program first checks if `xa > xb`. If Alice's chip is below Bob's chip, the game will end in a draw because Alice cannot move upwards, and Bob cannot move downwards. This is a valid condition for a draw.

2. **Calculate the Number of Moves to Converge:**
   - The program calculates `x = abs(xa - xb) // 2`, which represents the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to potentially meet in the middle of the board if they move optimally. This is a correct approach because each move by Alice and Bob reduces the vertical distance by 1, and they can meet after an even number of moves.

3. **Odd Number of Moves:**
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is 1, it means the number of moves required for Alice and Bob to meet is odd. In this case:
     - The program calculates the leftmost and rightmost possible positions `l` and `r` where Alice and Bob can meet after `x` moves.
     - It then checks if Alice's current position `ya` is within the range `[l, r]` and if the distance from `ya` to `l` or `r` is less than or equal to `x + 1`. If this condition is met, Alice can win. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.
   - This logic is correct because if Alice can move to a position where Bob will be after an odd number of moves, she can win by placing her chip in the same cell as Bob.

4. **Even Number of Moves:**
   - If `abs(xa - xb) % 2` is 0, it means the number of moves required for Alice and Bob to meet is even. In this case:
     - The program calculates the leftmost and rightmost possible positions `l` and `r` where Alice and Bob can meet after `x` moves.
     - It then checks if Bob's current position `yb` is within the range `[l, r]` and if the distance from `yb` to `l` or `r` is less than or equal to `x`. If this condition is met, Bob can win. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.
   - This logic is correct because if Bob can move to a position where Alice will be after an even number of moves, he can win by placing his chip in the same cell as Alice.

5. **Output:**
   - The program uses the `print` function to output the result for each test case. It correctly handles the output format by printing "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the conditions.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the given conditions and edge cases correctly. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice and Bob's chips and the number of moves required to meet.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
