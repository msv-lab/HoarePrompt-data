Output State: **The program returns the absolute difference between the number of integers in the expression and the number of "+" characters in the expression.**

To clarify, in the initial state, `count` is the number of "+" characters in `expression`, and `sub` is the difference between the length of `expression` and `count`. The program returns the absolute value of the difference between `sub` and `count`. Since `sub` is `length - count`, the program essentially returns the absolute value of the difference between the number of integers in the expression and the number of "+" characters.
