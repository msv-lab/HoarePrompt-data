Output State: **The `results` list contains `t` elements, each being the result of `func_1(n, p)` from each iteration of the loop. The `index` is the initial `index` plus the total number of elements processed in the loop, which is `t * (n + 1)` where `n` is the average number of elements in each `p` list. The values of `t`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged after the loop execution. The `data` list remains unchanged.**
