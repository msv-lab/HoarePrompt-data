Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner or a draw is flawed. Here's an example where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 4 2 2 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
Draw
```

Actual Output:
```
Alice
```

In this case, Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob starts at (3, 3). Alice can move to (3, 2), (3, 1), or (3, 3). If Alice moves to (3, 3), she wins. However, if Alice moves to (3, 2) or (3, 1), Bob can move to (2, 3), (2, 2), or (2, 1). If Bob moves to (2, 2), he wins. Therefore, Alice cannot guarantee a win, and Bob cannot guarantee a win either, leading to a draw. The program incorrectly identifies this as a win for Alice.
