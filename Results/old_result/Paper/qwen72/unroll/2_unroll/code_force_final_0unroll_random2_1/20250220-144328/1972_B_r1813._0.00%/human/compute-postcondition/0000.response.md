Output State: **The function is now set up to read input from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `s` are still as described in the initial state, and no other variables have been affected.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the variable `input` to the function `sys.stdin.read`, which reads from the standard input. This change does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `s`, which are still part of the function's parameters. No other variables are introduced or modified by this code snippet.
