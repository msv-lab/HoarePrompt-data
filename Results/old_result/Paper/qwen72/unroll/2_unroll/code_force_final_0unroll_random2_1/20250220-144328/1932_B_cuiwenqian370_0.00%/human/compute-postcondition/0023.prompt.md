You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: path is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity. The length of path is at least 2.
def func_1(path):
    n = len(path)
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0.
    #State: path is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity. The length of path is at least 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `path`. `n` is not equal to 0.
    dp = [0] * n

The length of `path` is at least 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `path`. `n` is not equal to 0. `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros, except if `path[0]` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf`. The first element of `path` is not '@'.
    #State: *`path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity. The length of `path` is at least 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `path`. `n` is not equal to 0. `dp` is a list of length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest of the elements in `dp` are zeros. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf` and the rest of the elements in `dp` are zeros. Otherwise, `dp` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
    if (n > 1) :
        if (path[1] == '*') :
            dp[1] = -float('inf')

The length of `path` is at least 2, and `n` is equal to the length of `path`. `n` is not equal to 0 and is greater than 1. `dp` is a list of length `n`. If the first element of `path` is '@', then `dp[0]` is 1 and `dp[1]` is 2 if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf` and `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is `-inf`. Otherwise, `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is 1 if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is 0. The rest of the elements in `dp` are zeros. If the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is `-inf`. If the second element of `path` is not '*', then the values of `dp[1]` are as described above.

If `n` > 1, `dp[1]` is 2 if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is 1. If the first element of `path` is '*', then `dp[0]` is `-inf`. If `n` > 1, `dp[1]` is `-inf` if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is `-inf`. If the first element of `path` is neither '@' nor '*', then `dp[0]` is 0. If `n` > 1, `dp[1]` is 1 if `path[1]` is '@', otherwise `dp[1]` is 0. The rest of the elements in `dp` are zeros. If the second element of `path` is '*', then `dp[1]` is `-inf`.

    #State: `dp` is a list of length `n`. Each element in `dp` represents the maximum number of '@' signs that can be collected up to that index, considering the constraints imposed by '*' signs. If an element in `path` is '*', the corresponding element in `dp` is `-inf`. If an element in `path` is '@', the corresponding element in `dp` is the maximum value of the previous two elements in `dp` plus 1. If an element in `path` is a sign's periodicity (not '@' or '*'), the corresponding element in `dp` is the maximum value of the previous two elements in `dp`.
    return max(x for x in dp if x > -float('inf'))
    #The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `path`, which is a non-empty list of strings with each string being either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity, and the length of `path` is at least 2. It returns `0` in one case, and in another case, it returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0.

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
