The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `expression` and `length`. `expression` is a string consisting only of the characters "+" and "-", and `length` is a positive integer such that 1 <= length <= 5000 and `length` is equal to the length of `expression`.

The function returns the absolute difference between the number of integers in the `expression` and the number of "+" characters in the `expression`.
