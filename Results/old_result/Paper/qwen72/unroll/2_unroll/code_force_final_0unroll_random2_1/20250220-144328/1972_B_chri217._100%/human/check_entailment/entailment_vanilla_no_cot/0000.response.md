Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. Here’s a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling (func_1)**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins.
   - It collects these test cases into a list and returns the list.

2. **Logic for Determining the Winner (func_2)**:
   - The function counts the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`) in the string `s`.
   - It returns "YES" if the count of facing-up coins is odd, and "NO" if the count is even.

The logic in `func_2` is based on the observation that the game can be reduced to a parity problem. Here’s why this works:

- **Parity Analysis**:
  - Each move removes one facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins.
  - Flipping a coin changes its state from up to down or from down to up.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice can always make a move that leaves an even number of facing-up coins for Bob.
  - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Bob can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Alice.
  - This parity alternation continues until one player is left with no facing-up coins to choose, and thus loses the game.

Given this, the program correctly determines the winner based on the initial parity of the number of facing-up coins. If the number of facing-up coins is odd, Alice will win; if it is even, Bob will win. The program handles all the test cases as described in the problem statement.
