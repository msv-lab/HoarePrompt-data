The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range(cases)` function, so it starts at 0 and will iterate up to `cases - 1`.

State: **`info` list contains `cases` sublists, each with three integers representing the positions of the letters after decoding, `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
