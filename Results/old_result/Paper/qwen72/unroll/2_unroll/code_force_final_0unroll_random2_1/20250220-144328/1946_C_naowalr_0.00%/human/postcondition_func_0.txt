The function reads an integer `t` from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from standard input, where `n` is the number of vertices in a tree and `k` is a positive integer less than `n`. It then reads `n-1` lines to construct an adjacency list `adj` representing the tree. The function performs a binary search to determine the maximum value `L` such that the tree can be cut into at most `k` connected components, each with a size of at least `L`. After processing all test cases, the function prints the value of `L` for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.
