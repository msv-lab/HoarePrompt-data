### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The program uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - However, the loop for \(b\) starts from 4 instead of 1, which is incorrect based on the problem statement.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is checked using the modulo operation.
   - The program should check if \((a + b) \% (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

5. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of valid pairs and prints it.
   - However, the logic used to calculate the sum is incorrect. The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) does not correctly count the valid pairs.

6. **Correct Logic**:
   - The correct approach should involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition for each pair.
   - The loop for \(b\) should start from 1 and go up to \(m\).
   - The loop for \(a\) should start from 1 and go up to \(n\).

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the program should find pairs like \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\).
   - The program's current logic does not correctly identify these pairs.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(b\) and the logic used to count valid pairs is flawed.

Correctness: **False**
