Output State: **The function `func` processes all test cases and prints the result for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` are updated and used within each iteration of the loop, but their values are reset for each new test case. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the state of these variables is not retained and is irrelevant. The only relevant state is the number of test cases `t`, which remains unchanged.**
