Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the way it calculates the possible positions for Alice and Bob and checks for a win. Specifically, the logic for determining the `l` and `r` values and the conditions for checking if Alice or Bob wins are incorrect. Here is a case where the program fails:

### Test Case:
```
Input:
1
6 5 2 2 5 3
```

### Expected Output:
```
Alice
```

### Actual Output:
```
Draw
```

### Explanation:
In this test case, Alice starts at (2, 2) and Bob starts at (5, 3). Alice can win by moving to (3, 3) on her first turn, and then Bob will move to (4, 2) or (4, 4). Alice can then move to (4, 3) on her second turn, and Bob will have to move to (3, 2) or (3, 4). Alice can then move to (5, 3) on her third turn, winning the game. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" for this case.

The issue lies in the way the program calculates the possible positions and the conditions for checking if Alice or Bob wins. The program does not correctly simulate the game's rules and the optimal moves for both players.
