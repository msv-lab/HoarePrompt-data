Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the binary string is already sorted and contains only '0's or only '1's correctly. Specifically, the program increments the `count` whenever it encounters a change in the characters, but it does not account for the fact that if the string is already sorted, it should return `1` regardless of the length of the string.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
00000000
```
The program will output `1`, which is correct. However, for the input:
```
1
11111111
```
The program will also output `1`, which is correct. But for the input:
```
1
00000001
```
The program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because the string is already sorted and does not require any cuts.

To fix this, the program should check if the string is already sorted and return `1` in such cases.
