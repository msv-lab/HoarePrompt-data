### Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires finding the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, where each subarray's product of its length and its maximum value equals `m`.
   - If no such `m` exists, the answer should be `-1`.
   - The program is allowed to make at most `2n` queries to determine this value.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Reads a list of integers from input.
   - **func_2**: Reads a single integer from input.
   - **func_3**: Reads a list of integers from input and returns an iterator.
   - **func_4**: Reads a string from input and strips leading and trailing whitespace.
   - **func_5**: This is the main function that interacts with the problem constraints and performs the necessary queries.

3. **func_5 Logic**:
   - **Initial Query Loop**:
     - The function iterates from `n` down to 1, making queries of the form `? 1 (i * n)`.
     - It checks if the response `v` from `func_2` equals `n`. If so, it sets `v` to the current `i` and breaks the loop.
     - This loop is intended to find the maximum possible value of `m` that can be achieved by the entire array.
   - **Subarray Query Loop**:
     - The function then iterates from 1 to `n // k + 1`, making queries of the form `? l (i * v)`.
     - It updates `l` to the response from `func_2` plus 1 and decrements `cnt` (which starts as `k`).
     - If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` equals `n + 1`, it prints the result `! (i * v)` and returns.
     - If no such condition is met, it prints `! -1` and returns.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - **Initial Query Loop**:
     - The loop is designed to find the maximum possible value of `m` that can be achieved by the entire array. This is a reasonable approach because the maximum value of `m` for the entire array is `n * max(a)`.
     - However, the loop should break when `v` is found, and it does so correctly.
   - **Subarray Query Loop**:
     - The loop attempts to find a valid split of the array into `k` subarrays where each subarray's product of length and maximum value equals `i * v`.
     - The logic of updating `l` and decrementing `cnt` is correct for checking if a valid split exists.
     - The condition `if cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` ensures that all subarrays are valid and the entire array is covered.
     - If no valid split is found, it correctly prints `! -1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k = 1` correctly, as it will always find `m` equal to `f(1, n)`.
   - The function also handles the case where no valid split exists by printing `! -1`.

6. **Query Limit**:
   - The function makes at most `n` queries in the initial loop and at most `n` queries in the subarray loop, which is within the allowed `2n` queries.

### Conclusion
The function `func_5` correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays with the required properties. It handles all edge cases and adheres to the query limit.

Correctness: **True**
