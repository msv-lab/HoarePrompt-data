Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by the number of chat participants (`n`) and the number of participants who posted screenshots (`k`). For each test case, the function reads `k` lines of `n` distinct integers, representing the order of participants shown to the participant who posted the screenshot. The function checks if the order of participants shown to each participant is consistent with the conditions specified. If the conditions are met for all participants in a test case, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function has no side effects on the input variables, and the state of the program is reset for each new test case. **
