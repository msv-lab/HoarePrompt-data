Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers. Additionally, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. The condition `(k - 1 < n - k + 1)` is false, which means `(k - 1 >= n - k + 1)`.**
