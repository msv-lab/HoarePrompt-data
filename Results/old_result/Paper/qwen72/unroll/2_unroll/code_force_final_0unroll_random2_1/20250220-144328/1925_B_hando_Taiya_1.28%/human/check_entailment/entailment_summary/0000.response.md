### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program iterates over all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i` of `x`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` or `i`.
   - If `n <= x // i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - If `n <= i`, it updates `ans` to be the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The GCD of a set of numbers is the largest number that divides all of them.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `i` can be a common divisor of `n` sub-problems, each having a difficulty of `i`.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, then `x // i` can be a common divisor of `n` sub-problems, each having a difficulty of `x // i`.
   - By iterating over all divisors up to the square root of `x`, the program ensures that it checks all possible divisors efficiently.
   - The program correctly updates `ans` to the maximum possible GCD that satisfies the conditions.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem difficulty as `1`, which gives a GCD of `1`.
   - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the program correctly identifies that the maximum GCD is `2` by splitting `10` into `4, 2, 4`.
   - For `x = 420` and `n = 69`, the program correctly identifies that the maximum GCD is `6` by splitting `420` into `6` repeated `70` times (since `6` is the largest divisor of `420` that is less than or equal to `69`).

5. **Input/Output Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - Each test case reads `x` and `n` from the input and prints the result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the problemset. It efficiently checks all possible divisors and updates the answer accordingly. The edge cases and example inputs are handled correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
