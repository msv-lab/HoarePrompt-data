The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 1000`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`. The function then calculates a list `ans` of integers based on the value of `k`. Specifically, it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, and constructs a list `ans` that includes `k - (1 << i)`, `k + 1`, and `k + 1 + (1 << i)`, where `i` is the exponent of the largest power of 2. Additionally, it appends all powers of 2 up to `1 << 19` to the list, except for `1 << i`. The function prints the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their final values from the last test case, and the loop variables `tc`, `i`, and `j` are no longer in scope.
