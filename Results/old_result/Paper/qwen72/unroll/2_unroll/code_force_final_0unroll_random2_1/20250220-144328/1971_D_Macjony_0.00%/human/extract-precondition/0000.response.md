Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.**
