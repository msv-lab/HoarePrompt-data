    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns the list `ans` in its original order, where `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements in `b` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of `n` positive integers), and `s` (a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by selecting elements from `a` based on the characters in `s` ('L' for left and 'R' for right). The function then returns a list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `b`, in the original order of `b`. The final state of the program includes the unchanged parameters `n`, `m`, and `a`, the string `s` of length `n` with characters 'L' and 'R', the list `b` of `n` positive integers, and the list `ans` with the cumulative products.
