To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop head:

1. `left <= right`
2. `right < len(s)`
3. `left < len(s)`

Given the current state:
- `s` is a list containing all the characters of the binary string `sChar` in the same order.
- `left` is 0.
- `cost` is 0.
- `right` is 1.

Let's evaluate each condition:

1. **`left <= right`**:
   - `left` is 0 and `right` is 1.
   - 0 <= 1 is true, so this condition is satisfied.

2. **`right < len(s)`**:
   - `right` is 1.
   - For this condition to be true, `len(s)` must be greater than 1.
   - Since `s` is a list containing all the characters of the binary string `sChar`, `len(s)` is the length of `sChar`.
   - Therefore, `sChar` must have at least 2 characters for this condition to be true.

3. **`left < len(s)`**:
   - `left` is 0.
   - For this condition to be true, `len(s)` must be greater than 0.
   - Since `s` is a list containing all the characters of the binary string `sChar`, `len(s)` is the length of `sChar`.
   - Therefore, `sChar` must have at least 1 character for this condition to be true.

Since `left <= right` is already true and `left < len(s)` will be true as long as `sChar` has at least 1 character, the only condition that needs to be ensured is `right < len(s)`. This requires `sChar` to have at least 2 characters.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `sChar` has at least 2 characters.

State: **`s` is a list containing all the characters of the binary string `sChar` in the same order, `sChar` must have at least 2 characters, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0, `right` is 1**
