Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program fails to correctly handle the case where the binary representation of `x` has consecutive 1s. According to the problem description, there should not be consecutive non-zero values in the array `a`. However, the program does not always ensure this condition is met.

For example, consider the input `x = 7`:
- The binary representation of 7 is `111`.
- The program will initially set `s` to `['1', '1', '1']`.
- The program then attempts to adjust the array to avoid consecutive 1s, but it does not correctly handle this case.

The expected output should be:
```
4
-1 -1 0 1
```
However, the program will output:
```
4
-1 0 -1 1
```
This output is incorrect because it has consecutive non-zero values at indices 2 and 3 (`-1` and `1`).

Thus, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
