Output State: **The loop will execute for `num` iterations, and for each iteration, it will read `num2` and `case` from the input. If `num2` is greater than 10000, it will print `1` and `16668` and break out of the loop. Otherwise, it will parse the list `a` from `case`, sort it, and then increment the middle element until the median increases, printing the number of operations required. After all iterations, the loop will have processed `num` test cases, and the variables `i`, `num2`, `case`, `op`, `a`, `b`, `ma`, and `median` will have their final values based on the last test case processed.**
