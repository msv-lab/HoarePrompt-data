Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function performs the following actions based on the values of `n` and `k`:

1. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES', followed by two '1's, and returns `None`.
2. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' and returns nothing.
3. If `n` is greater than `k`, it calculates a list `costs` with values `[n - k + 1, 1]` and a variable `h` which is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`. It then prints 'NO' if `h` is less than `k`, or prints '2', 'YES', and the values in `costs` if `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `n` is 0, `h` is calculated as described, and `costs` is a list with values `[n - k + 1, 1]`. The function does not return any value in any case. **
