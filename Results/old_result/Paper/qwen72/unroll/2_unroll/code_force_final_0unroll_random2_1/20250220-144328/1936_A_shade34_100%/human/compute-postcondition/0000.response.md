To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
```

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. For the loop to execute, this value must be greater than 0.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Identify the Objects in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains a call to `range(int(input()))`.
   - The `int(input())` function reads an integer from the standard input and converts it to an integer.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute if the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - If the value is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - The state before the loop starts should ensure that `int(input())` returns a positive integer.
   - Since the function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, the input should be a positive integer indicating the number of test cases.

### Adjusted State:
- The input must be a positive integer to ensure the loop executes at least once.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
