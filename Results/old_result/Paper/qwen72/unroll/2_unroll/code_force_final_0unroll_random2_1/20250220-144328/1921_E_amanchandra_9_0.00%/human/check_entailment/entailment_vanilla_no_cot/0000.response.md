Correctness: **False**

The program provided has a logical error in its approach to determining the game's outcome. The logic for calculating the possible positions and checking the conditions for a win or draw is flawed. Specifically, the way it calculates the left (`l`) and right (`r`) boundaries and checks the conditions for Alice or Bob to win does not correctly reflect the game's rules and the optimal play strategy.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (h, w, xa, ya, xb, yb) = map(int, input().split())
        if xa > xb:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            # Calculate the number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to meet
            moves = (xb - xa) // 2
            # Check if they can meet in the same column
            if (yb - ya) % 2 == 0 and abs(yb - ya) <= 2 * moves:
                print('Alice')
            else:
                print('Draw')

```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Check for Draw**: If Alice's chip is already below Bob's chip (`xa > xb`), the game will end in a draw because Bob cannot move down and Alice cannot move up.
2. **Calculate Moves**: The number of moves it would take for Alice and Bob to meet in the same row is `(xb - xa) // 2`.
3. **Check Column Difference**: For Alice to win, the column difference between Alice's and Bob's chips must be even and within the range of possible moves. This ensures that Alice can move to the same column as Bob within the given number of moves.
4. **Output the Result**: If the conditions for Alice to win are met, print "Alice"; otherwise, print "Draw".

This corrected version should accurately determine the outcome of the game based on the provided problem description.
