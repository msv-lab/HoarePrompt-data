The only objects in the loop head are variables `T` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, but this information is not relevant to the loop head. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0 and `T` should start at 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `T` is 0**
