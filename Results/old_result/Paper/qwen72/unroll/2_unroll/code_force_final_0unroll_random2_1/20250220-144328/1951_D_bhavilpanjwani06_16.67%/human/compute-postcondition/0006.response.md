Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18.
- The function is handling multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers.
- `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Additionally, the current values of `n` and `k` are equal.

Given these conditions, the `print(1)` statement will always print the integer `1`, regardless of the values of `n` and `k` because the print statement does not depend on `n` or `k` in any way.

Output: **1**
