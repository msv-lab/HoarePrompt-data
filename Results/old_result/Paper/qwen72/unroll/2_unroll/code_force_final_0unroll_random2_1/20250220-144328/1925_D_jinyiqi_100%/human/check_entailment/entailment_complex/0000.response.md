### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, the number of pairs of friends, and the number of excursions, respectively.

2. **Sum of Friendship Values**:
   - The function initializes `sum_f` to 0 and then iterates over the `m` pairs of friends, summing their initial friendship values `f`.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The function calculates `cn2` as the number of ways to choose 2 children from `n` children, which is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
   - The formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values is derived from the problem statement. The expected value is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Expected Value} = \frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)}{2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2}
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the initial friendship values and the incremental increases in friendship values for each excursion.

4. **Simplification and Modular Inverse**:
   - The function simplifies the fraction by dividing both the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` where `M` is \(10^9 + 7\).
   - Finally, it prints the result of `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `m` is 0 (no pairs of friends) correctly, as `sum_f` will be 0, and the expected value will be 0.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is 1 correctly, as the friendship values will not change after the first excursion.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each test case and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The formula used is derived from the problem statement and is mathematically sound. The function also handles edge cases appropriately.
