You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        i = 0
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        print(len(ans))
        print(*ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        i = 0
        
        while 1 << i + 1 <= k:
            i = i + 1
        
        ans = [k - (1 << i), k + 1, k + 1 + (1 << i)]
        
        for j in range(20):
            if j != i:
                ans.append(1 << j)
        
        print(len(ans))
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing for all `t` test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` were read from input, and the loop calculated and printed a list `ans` of integers. The length of `ans` and the integers in `ans` were printed for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their final values from the last test case, and the loop variables `tc`, `i`, and `j` are no longer in scope.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not always generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not handle the case where `k` is a power of 2 correctly. For example, consider the input `n = 8` and `k = 8`:

- The program generates the sequence `[0, 9, 11, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576]`.
- This sequence includes `0`, which is a non-negative integer, but it does not ensure that there is no subsequence with a sum of `8`.
- Additionally, the sequence includes `8`, which means there is a subsequence (the single element `8`) that sums to `8`, violating the condition that there should be no subsequence with a sum of `k`.

To meet the problem's requirements, the sequence should be constructed such that no subsequence sums to `k`, but all other values from `1` to `n` (excluding `k`) should have a subsequence that sums to them. The current implementation does not guarantee this for all cases.
