Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t` and returns it as an integer.
   - `func_2` reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and returns a map object of integers. This is used to read the values of `n` and `k`, as well as the lists of `a_i` and `b_i`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `func_4` initializes an empty heap and a list `combined` that contains tuples of the form `(-a_i, b_i)`. The negative of `a_i` is used to facilitate the use of a min-heap to simulate a max-heap.
   - The `combined` list is sorted by `b_i` to ensure that items with the highest `b_i` (Bob's price) are considered first.
   - The first `k` items are pushed into the heap, which simulates Bob taking these items for free.
   - The function then calculates the current profit using `func_3`, which sums the profits of the items in the heap and the remaining items that Alice can sell to Bob.
   - The function iterates through the remaining items, adjusting the current profit and the heap to find the maximum profit.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - `func_3` calculates the total profit by summing the `b_i - a_i` values of the items in the heap and adding the `a_i + b_i` values of the remaining items that have a non-negative profit.
   - The `func_4` function updates the maximum profit by comparing the current profit with the maximum profit found so far.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit, and Bob wants to minimize it. The strategy of pushing the first `k` items into the heap and then adjusting the heap to maximize the profit is a reasonable approach.
   - The use of a heap ensures that Bob takes the items with the highest `b_i` values for free, which minimizes Alice's profit if she sells those items to Bob.
   - The function correctly handles the case where Alice can sell items to Bob with a positive profit.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `k` is 0, meaning Bob takes no items for free.
   - The function also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n`, meaning Bob takes all items for free.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the maximum profit for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The functions work together to handle the input, process the test cases, and output the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
