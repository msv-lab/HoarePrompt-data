Postcondition: **`r` is a list of integers. `n` is `r[0]`, `m` is `r[1]`, `x1` is `r[2] + a`, `y1` is `r[3] - a` if `y2 <= y1` else `r[3] + a`, `x2` is `r[4] - a`, `y2` is 1 if `y2 <= y1` else `r[1]`. `a` is `r[5] - 1` if `y1 >= y2` else `r[1] - r[5]`. `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`. `x2` is greater than `x1`, `x1` is greater than or equal to 1, and `x2` is less than or equal to `n`. If `y2 <= y1`, `x2` is equal to `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `c` is `y1 - 1`. If `y2 > y1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, and `c` is `m - y1`. Additionally, the current value of `b // 2` is greater than `a`, the absolute value of `x2 - c` is greater than or equal to `x1 + c`, `y1` is between 1 and `m` inclusive, and `x1` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.**
