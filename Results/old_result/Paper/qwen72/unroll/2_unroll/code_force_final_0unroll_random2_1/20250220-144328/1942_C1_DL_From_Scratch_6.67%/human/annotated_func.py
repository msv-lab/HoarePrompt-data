#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `n` must satisfy 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` must satisfy 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        list0 = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        list0 = sorted(list0)
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(x - 1):
            num = list0[i + 1] - list0[i] - 1
            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        
        num = n - list0[-1]
        
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        
        print(count + x - 2)
        
    #State: The loop executes `T` times, and for each iteration, it prints the number of pairs of consecutive chosen vertices that are exactly one vertex apart, plus `x - 2`. The values of `n`, `x`, and `chosen_vertices` are not modified by the loop, and `T` is decremented by 1 after each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `T` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, followed by a list of `x` integers representing chosen vertices. It then calculates the number of pairs of consecutive chosen vertices that are exactly one vertex apart, adds `x - 2` to this count, and prints the result. The function does not return any value. The values of `n`, `x`, and the list of chosen vertices are not modified by the function. The function repeats this process `T` times.
