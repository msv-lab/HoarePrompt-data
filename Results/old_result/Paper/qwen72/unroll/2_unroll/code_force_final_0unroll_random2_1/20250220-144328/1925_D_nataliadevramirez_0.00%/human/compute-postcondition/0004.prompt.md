You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2, but it reads inputs from the standard input. The first input is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function reads three integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively. It then reads m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        friendships = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        
        result = func_1(n, m, k, friendships)
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has executed `t` times. Each execution of the loop reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from input, reads `m` lines of friendship data, calls `func_1` with the provided arguments, and prints the result. No other variables are affected.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. It then reads `m` lines, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The function processes these inputs and returns the results for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
