Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.

2. **Friendship Value Sum Calculation**: The program sums up the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends. This is done correctly using a loop that reads each friendship pair and adds the friendship value to `sum_f`.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The program calculates the number of ways to choose a pair of children from `n` children, which is `cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2`. This is the correct combinatorial formula for choosing 2 items from `n` items.

4. **Expected Value Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all `k` pairs chosen. The formula used is:
     \[
     p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \text{cn2} \cdot \text{sum_f} + m \cdot k \cdot (k - 1)
     \]
     \[
     q = 2 \cdot \text{cn2}^2
     \]
   - The term `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f` accounts for the initial friendship values being chosen `k` times.
   - The term `m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the increase in friendship values due to the pairs being chosen multiple times. This is because each pair of friends can be chosen in `k` excursions, and each time it is chosen, the friendship value increases by 1 for the subsequent excursions.

5. **Simplification and Modulo Operation**:
   - The program simplifies the fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) by dividing both `p` and `q` by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - It then calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)` and multiplies it by `p` to get the final result, which is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where there are no friends (i.e., `m = 0`) correctly, as it will result in `sum_f = 0`, and the expected value will be 0.
   - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as shown in the second test case.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints given in the problem, as it processes each test case in \(O(m + \log q)\) time, where `m` is the number of friendship pairs and \(\log q\) is the time complexity for calculating the modular inverse.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.
