You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the values of t, n, a, and b are unchanged. The loop prints the result of the calculation for each test case, which is either `a * n` if `b <= a`, or `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` where `k = min(n, b - a)`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. It calculates the maximum profit by considering the optimal value of \( k \) (the number of buns to be sold at the modified price). The logic ensures that if \( b \le a \), all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \), which is the correct approach since selling at the modified price would not yield a higher profit. If \( b > a \), the program calculates the profit by selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price, where \( k \) is chosen to maximize the profit. The calculation \( b \cdot k - k \cdot (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) \cdot a \) correctly accounts for the sum of the modified prices and the usual prices, ensuring the maximum profit is obtained. The program also handles the constraints and edge cases, such as when \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) are large or when \( n \) is 1. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
