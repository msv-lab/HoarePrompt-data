Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept the string `s` and the number of test cases `t` as arguments. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, s):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and s is a string of length at most 10 consisting of lowercase English letters.**
