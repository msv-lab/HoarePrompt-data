#State of the program right berfore the function call: fillvalue is a string that will be returned for recursive calls to the `repr` function.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the `decorating_function`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `fillvalue` and returns the `decorating_function`. It is intended to be used as a decorator to modify the behavior of a `repr` function, such that it returns the specified `fillvalue` for recursive calls. However, the function itself does not modify `fillvalue` or perform any actions beyond returning `decorating_function`.
