The only objects in the loop head are the variables `tc` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer, and `stones` is a list of lists as described. The state of `t` and `tc` are the only ones that can be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `tc` should start at 0. The state of `stones` does not need to be adjusted because it is not part of the loop head, but it must be valid as per the problem description.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0, `stones` is a list of lists where each sublist represents the piles of stones for a test case, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2Â·10^5`.**
