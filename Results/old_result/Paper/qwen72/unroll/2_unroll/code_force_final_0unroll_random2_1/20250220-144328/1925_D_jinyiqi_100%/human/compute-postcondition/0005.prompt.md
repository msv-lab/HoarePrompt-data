You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, m, and k, where n is the number of children (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), m is the number of pairs of friends (0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2)), and k is the number of excursions (1 ≤ k ≤ 2 × 10^5). Additionally, m lines follow, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i, representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i) and their initial friendship value (1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. The function should return an integer for each test case, which is the answer to the problem modulo (10^9 + 7).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    M = 10 ** 9 + 7
    for i in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        sum_f = 0
        
        for j in range(m):
            a, b, f = map(int, input().split())
            sum_f += f
        
        cn2 = n * (n - 1) // 2
        
        p = 2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)
        
        q = 2 * cn2 ** 2
        
        gcd = math.gcd(p, q)
        
        p = p // gcd
        
        q = q // gcd
        
        print(int(p * pow(q, -1, M) % M))
        
    #State: The function `func` processes all test cases and prints the result for each test case. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `sum_f`, `cn2`, `p`, `q`, and `gcd` are updated and used within each iteration of the loop, but their values are reset for each new test case. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the state of these variables is not retained and is irrelevant. The only relevant state is the number of test cases `t`, which remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and `m` lines of friendship data. It returns an integer for each test case, representing the answer to the problem modulo (10^9 + 7).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
