Let's analyze the initial state and the conditions step by step to determine what will be printed when the `print('draw')` statement is executed.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + a`.
- `y1` is `r[3]`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`.
- `x2` is still greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is still even.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- `a` is either `y1 - 1` if `y2` is greater than or equal to `y1`, or `m - y1` if `y2` is less than `y1`.
- `b` is `x2 - x1`.
- `t` is the absolute value of `y2 - y1`.
- Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition `x2` is still greater than `x1` is explicitly stated.
   - The condition that the difference between `x2` and `x1` is still even is also explicitly stated.
   - The condition `y1` is not equal to `y2` is explicitly stated.
   - The additional condition states that either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

2. **Contradiction:**
   - The additional condition states that either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, or `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.
   - However, we already know from the initial state that `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - Therefore, the only possible conditions left are `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `x2` is greater than `x1` and the difference between `x2` and `x1` is even, the only way the additional condition can be true is if `x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`.
   - Given that `x1` and `x2` are derived from the input list `r` and the value of `a`, and the conditions are such that `x2` is greater than `x1`, the most likely scenario is that `x2` is greater than `n` or `x1` is less than 1.

### Final Output:
The `print('draw')` statement will print the string 'draw' because the additional condition is met, either `x1` is less than 1 or `x2` is greater than `n`.

Output: **draw**
