The code snippet `num = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `num`. The `input()` function accepts an input from the user, and `int()` converts this input to an integer. The initial state specifies that the function `func` is incomplete and should be defined as `def min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a):`, and that the function will be called multiple times for different test cases. The total number of test cases `t` is such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. After executing the code snippet, the variable `num` will hold an integer value provided by the user, and the other details of the initial state remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function `min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a)` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function will be called multiple times for different test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `num` is an input integer.**
