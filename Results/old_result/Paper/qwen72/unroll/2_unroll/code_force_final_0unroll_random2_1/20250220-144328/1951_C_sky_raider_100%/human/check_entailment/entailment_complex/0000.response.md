Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of purchasing exactly `k` tickets at the minimum cost, given the constraints on the number of tickets that can be bought per day and the price increases after each purchase. Let's break down the logic and verify if it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list `l` of ticket prices in ascending order. This is a crucial step because it ensures that the program always considers the lowest available price first, which helps in minimizing the total cost.

3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**:
   - The program initializes `t` to 0, which will track the total number of tickets bought so far.
   - It initializes `c` to 0, which will accumulate the total cost.
   - It iterates over each day, calculating the number of tickets to buy on that day as the minimum of `m` (the maximum tickets allowed per day) and `k` (the remaining tickets needed).
   - It adds the cost of the tickets bought on the current day to `c`.
   - It updates `t` by adding the number of tickets bought on the current day.
   - It decreases `k` by the number of tickets bought on the current day.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all days for a test case, the program prints the total cost `c`.

5. **State Reset**:
   - The program correctly resets the state for the next test case by reinitializing `t`, `c`, and `k` for each new test case.

### Verification of Correctness:
- **Sorting**: Sorting the ticket prices ensures that the program always buys tickets at the lowest possible price first, which is optimal.
- **Purchase Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the number of tickets to buy on each day as the minimum of `m` and `k`, ensuring that it does not exceed the daily limit and buys exactly `k` tickets in total.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets bought on a day by the price of that day plus the total number of tickets bought so far (`t`), which correctly accounts for the price increase after each purchase.
- **State Management**: The program correctly manages the state for each test case, ensuring that the variables are reset appropriately.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
