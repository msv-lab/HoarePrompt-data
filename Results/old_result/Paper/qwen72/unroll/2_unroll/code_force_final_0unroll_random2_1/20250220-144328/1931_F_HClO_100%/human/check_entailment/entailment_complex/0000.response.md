### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Checks:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and processes `k` lines of input.
   - If `k == 1`, the function immediately prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case, which is correct because a single screenshot can always be consistent with the order.

2. **Processing the First Two Screenshots:**
   - The function reads the first two lines of the screenshot and extracts the author (`a1` and `a2`) and the remaining list of participants (`l1` and `l2`).
   - It then creates `l11` and `l22` by removing the author from the respective lists.
   - If `l11` and `l22` are not equal, the function prints 'no' and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if the lists are different, the order cannot be consistent.

3. **Finding the Insertion Point:**
   - The function initializes `idx1` and `idx2` to -1 and `p1` and `p2` to 0.
   - It iterates through the lists `l1` and `l2` to find the first position where the elements differ.
   - If the elements differ and one of them is the author of the other list, it sets the corresponding index and updates the pointer.
   - If both indices are found, it breaks the loop.

4. **Adjusting the Lists:**
   - If one of the indices is still -1, it sets it to `n - 2` (the second-to-last position).
   - Depending on the relative positions of `idx1` and `idx2`, it inserts the author into the appropriate list to create a consistent order.
   - If `m == 2` (i.e., only two screenshots), it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case.

5. **Processing Remaining Screenshots:**
   - The function reads the remaining `k - 2` lines of input and stores them in `val`.
   - For each remaining screenshot, it checks if the order of participants (excluding the author) matches the consistent order created earlier.
   - If any screenshot does not match, it prints 'no' and breaks the loop.
   - If all screenshots match, it prints 'yes'.

### Correctness:
The function correctly handles the problem by ensuring that the order of participants shown to each participant is consistent with the conditions specified. It processes each test case independently and resets the necessary variables for the next test case. The logic for finding the insertion point and checking the consistency of the order is sound.

**Correctness: True**
