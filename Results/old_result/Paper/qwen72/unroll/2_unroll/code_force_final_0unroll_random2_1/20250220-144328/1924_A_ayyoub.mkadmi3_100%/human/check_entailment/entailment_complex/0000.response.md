### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - It initializes two empty strings `s1` and `s2`, and a set `alphabet` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It iterates through each character in `s`:
     - If the character is in the `alphabet` set, it is added to `s1`.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains more than one character, the character is removed from the set.
     - If the `alphabet` set contains only one character, it is added to `s2`, and the set is reset to its initial state.
   - After processing the string `s`, it calculates `r` as the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`.
   - It returns a tuple with three elements:
     - A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`.
     - A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`.
     - The string `s2`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - If the boolean returned by `func_1` is `False`, the program appends "No" to the `OUT` list.
   - It then constructs a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in `s` by:
     - Finding the first character from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets that is not in `s1`.
     - Appending this character enough times to make the string of length `n`.
   - If the boolean is `True`, the program appends "Yes" to the `OUT` list.
   - Finally, it prints each element in the `OUT` list.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Subsequence Check:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The logic of removing characters from the `alphabet` set and resetting it is not sufficient to ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked.
   - The function should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.

2. **String Construction:**
   - The method of constructing a string that does not occur as a subsequence by finding a character not in `s1` and repeating it is not always correct.
   - For example, if `s1` contains all characters from the first `k` alphabets but not in the required combinations, the constructed string might still be a subsequence of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The subsequence check and the construction of the string that does not occur as a subsequence are flawed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
