The code snippet `loop = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `loop`. The `input()` function waits for user input, and `int()` converts that input to an integer. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 for each test case. The constraints for each test case are also defined, but the code snippet only affects the `loop` variable.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `loop` is an input integer, and the constraints for each test case remain unchanged.**
