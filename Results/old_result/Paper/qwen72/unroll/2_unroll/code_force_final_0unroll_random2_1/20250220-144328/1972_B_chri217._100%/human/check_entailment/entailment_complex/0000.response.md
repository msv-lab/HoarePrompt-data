Reasoning:  
The problem requires determining the winner of a game where players take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping the adjacent coins. The game ends when no facing-up coins are left, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

The key to solving this problem lies in understanding the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins. Here's why:

1. **Initial State and Moves**:
   - If there are an even number of facing-up coins, Alice can always mirror Bob's moves. For example, if Bob removes a facing-up coin and flips the adjacent coins, Alice can do the same with another facing-up coin, ensuring that the number of facing-up coins remains even after each of her moves. This strategy guarantees that Alice will always have a move if Bob has one, and she will be the one to make the last move, winning the game.
   - If there are an odd number of facing-up coins, Bob can mirror Alice's moves. This means that after Alice's first move, the number of facing-up coins becomes even, and Bob can then follow the same mirroring strategy as Alice, ensuring that he will make the last move and win the game.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` reads the input correctly and constructs a list of test cases, each containing the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the state of the coins. This function is correct.
   - `func_2` determines the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string `s` and returns 'YES' if the count is even, indicating that Alice will win, and 'NO' if the count is odd, indicating that Bob will win. This function is also correct.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where there are no facing-up coins (i.e., the string `s` contains only 'D') by returning 'NO', which is correct because the player who starts (Alice) will lose immediately.
   - The function also handles the case where there is only one coin left, which is correctly managed by the parity check.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
