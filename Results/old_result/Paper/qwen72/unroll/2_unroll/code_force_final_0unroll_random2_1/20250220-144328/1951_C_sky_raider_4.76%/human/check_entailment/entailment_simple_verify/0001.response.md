Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it ensures that the cheapest tickets are purchased first, which helps in minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which is not used effectively in the loop.
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect and unnecessary. The total cost `c` should be initialized to 0.

4. **Loop for Purchasing Tickets**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that the number of tickets bought each day does not exceed the daily limit `m` and does not exceed the remaining number of tickets `k` to be bought.
   - The remaining number of tickets `k` is then reduced by `s`.
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula is incorrect because it subtracts `s * s / 2` from the cost, which does not make sense in the context of the problem. The correct formula to update the cost should be `c += l[i] * s`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the integer value of `c` after the loop.

6. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to update the cost should be `c += l[i] * s`.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `k` is 0 after the loop, which should not affect the cost. However, since `k` is reduced by `s` in each iteration and the loop continues until `k` is 0, this edge case is implicitly handled.

8. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of buying the cheapest tickets first is correct, but the implementation has issues with the cost calculation.

Given these issues, the program is indeed incorrect. The initialization of `c` and the cost update formula are both flawed, leading to incorrect results.

Final: **False**
