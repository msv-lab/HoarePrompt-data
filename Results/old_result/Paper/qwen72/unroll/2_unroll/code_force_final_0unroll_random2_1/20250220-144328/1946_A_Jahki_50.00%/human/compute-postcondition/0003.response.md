The function `min_operations_to_increase_median` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a` by at least 1. The function will be called multiple times for different test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, and returns the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the list `a` by at least 1.**
