Output State: **The loop will execute `test_cases` times, and after each iteration, the variables `heap`, `remaining_items`, `n`, `k`, `prices`, `neg_prices`, `bonuses`, `max_profit`, `current_profit`, and `combined` will be reset to their initial states within the loop. The final output state will be the same as the initial state, except that `max_profit` will be printed for each test case.**
