No variables are directly passed to the function `func_4`. However, it relies on the outputs of `func_1` and `func_2` to provide the necessary inputs. `func_1` is expected to return the number of test cases, and `func_2` is expected to return a tuple of two integers (n, k) and lists of integers representing the item prices and bonuses.
