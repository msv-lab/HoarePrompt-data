### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts and Cost:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It also initializes a variable `ans` to store the total cost of operations.

4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0` and there are any `1`s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the `0` to the correct position.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes that need to be moved to the left of the current `1` to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing the string, the program prints the total cost `ans` for the current test case.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The string `10` can be sorted by performing a cyclic shift on the entire string, which costs 2. This is correct.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0000`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The string `0000` is already sorted, so no operations are needed. This is correct.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `11000`
  - Output: `9`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves three operations, each costing 3. This is correct.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `101011`
  - Output: `5`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 5. This is correct.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `01101001`
  - Output: `11`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 11. This is correct.

### Detailed Analysis:

The program's logic is based on the idea of counting the number of cyclic shifts needed to move each `0` to the left of any `1` that appears before it. This is a valid approach because:
- Each `0` that appears after a `1` needs to be moved to the left of the `1`.
- The cost of moving a `0` to the left of a `1` is the length of the substring from the `1` to the `0` (inclusive).

The program correctly implements this logic by:
- Incrementing the count of `1`s when a `1` is encountered.
- Adding the cost of moving a `0` to the left of a `1` when a `0` is encountered and there are `1`s before it.
- Adding the cost of moving all remaining `0`s to the left of a `1` when a `1` is encountered.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts. It handles all the test cases correctly and follows the problem description.
