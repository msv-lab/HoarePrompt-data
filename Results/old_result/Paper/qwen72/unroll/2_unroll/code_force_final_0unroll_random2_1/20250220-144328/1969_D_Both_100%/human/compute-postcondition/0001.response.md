The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a dummy variable used to indicate that the loop index is not used within the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` must be greater than 0, `_` is a dummy variable**
