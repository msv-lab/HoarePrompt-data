### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if the given array `b` can be rearranged to form a progressive square of size `n` using the given values `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`.
   - A progressive square is constructed such that each element `a_{i,j}` is calculated as `a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d`.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of `n * n` integers.
   - This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Finding the Minimum Element:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum element `a` from the array `l`. This minimum element is assumed to be `a_{1,1}`.
   - This is a valid assumption because the smallest element in the array must be `a_{1,1}` if the array can form a progressive square.

4. **Generating the Progressive Square:**
   - The program generates a list `li` of all elements that should be in the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - This step is correct because it correctly applies the formula to generate all possible elements of the progressive square.

5. **Sorting and Comparing:**
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`.
   - If they match, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array can form the progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
   - This step is also correct because sorting both lists ensures that we can compare the elements directly.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the input array `l` might already be in the correct order or might contain duplicate elements.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem statement, such as the range of `n`, `c`, `d`, and the elements in `l`.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and their correctness.
- The program's logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
- The annotations confirm that the state of the program at each key point is as expected.

### Final Evaluation:

The program is correct as it follows the steps of finding the minimum element, generating the expected elements, sorting both lists, and comparing them. The original assessment was accurate.

Final: **True**
