The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input (stdin), processes it to extract a series of paths, and then applies the function `func_1` to each path. The results of these function calls are collected into a list and printed to the console, one result per line. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `results` list contains the output of `func_1` for each path, and the variables `data`, `t`, and `index` are in the same state as described in the final annotation.
