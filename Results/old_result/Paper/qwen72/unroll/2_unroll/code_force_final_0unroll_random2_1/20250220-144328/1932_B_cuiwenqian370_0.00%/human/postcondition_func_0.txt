The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`, which is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity, and the length of `path` is at least 2. It returns the maximum number of '@' signs that can be collected while traversing the `path`, with the constraint that encountering a '*' sign results in an immediate penalty represented by `-inf`. If the `path` is empty, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the highest value in the `dp` list that is greater than `-inf`, which represents the optimal number of '@' signs that can be collected under the given constraints.
