The function `func_5` performs a series of queries using `func_2` and `func_3`. It first determines a value `v` by iterating from `n` down to 1, checking if the result of `func_2` equals `n`. If found, `v` is set to the corresponding `i`; otherwise, `v` remains 1. It then iterates from 1 to `n // k + 1`, performing additional queries and checking conditions. If a specific condition is met, it prints a result and calls `func_2` before returning. If no such condition is met, it prints `! -1` and calls `func_2` before returning. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any output.
