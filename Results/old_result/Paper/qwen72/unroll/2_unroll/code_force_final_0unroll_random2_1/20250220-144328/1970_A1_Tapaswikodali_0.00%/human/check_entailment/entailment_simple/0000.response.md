Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input string `s` which is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000.

2. **Balance Calculation**: The program iterates through the string `s` and calculates the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position. This is done correctly by incrementing the balance for an opening parenthesis `(` and decrementing it for a closing parenthesis `)`.

3. **Details List Construction**: The program constructs a list `details` where each element is a tuple `(balance, -i, char)`. This tuple contains the balance of the prefix before the character, the negative index of the character (to break ties in decreasing order of position), and the character itself. This construction is correct and aligns with the problem description.

4. **Sorting**: The program sorts the `details` list based on the balance and the negative index. This sorting ensures that the columns are sorted in increasing order of prefix balance, and ties are broken in decreasing order of position, as required.

5. **Result Construction**: The program constructs the result string by joining the characters from the sorted `details` list. This step is correct and follows the problem's definition of the balanced shuffle operation.

6. **Output**: The program prints the result string, which is the balanced shuffle of the input string `s`.

Given that all steps in the program align with the problem description and the logic is implemented correctly, the program should produce the correct output for any valid input.

Correctness: **True**
