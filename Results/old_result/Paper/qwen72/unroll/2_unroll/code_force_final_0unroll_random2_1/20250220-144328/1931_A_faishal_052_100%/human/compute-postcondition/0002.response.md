The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `func` and `n` are not relevant to the loop head, and `info` being an empty list does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `info` is an empty list**
