The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, there is a parameter constraint mentioned: `numero_testes` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `numero_testes` <= 10^4. This constraint likely refers to the context in which the function is used, but it does not directly influence the function's parameters. The function's output is not provided, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its return value cannot be determined from the provided information.**
