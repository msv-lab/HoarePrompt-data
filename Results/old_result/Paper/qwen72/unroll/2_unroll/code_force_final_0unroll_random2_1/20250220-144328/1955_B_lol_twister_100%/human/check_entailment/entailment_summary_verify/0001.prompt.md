You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A progressive square of size n is an n \times n matrix. Maxim chooses three
integers a_{1,1} , c , and d and constructs a progressive square according to
the following rules:

For example, if n = 3 , a_{1,1} = 1 , c=2 , and d=3 , then the progressive
square looks as follows:

Last month Maxim constructed a progressive square and remembered the values of
n , c , and d . Recently, he found an array b of n^2 integers in random order
and wants to make sure that these elements are the elements of that specific
square.

It can be shown that for any values of n , a_{1,1} , c , and d , there exists
exactly one progressive square that satisfies all the rules.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le {10} ^ 4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , c , and d (2 \le
n \le 500 , 1 \le c, d \le 10^6 ) — the size of the square and the values of c
and d as described in the statement.

The second line of each test case contains n \cdot n integers b_1, b_2, \dots,
b_{n \cdot n} (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements found by Maxim.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n ^ 2 over all test cases does not exceed 25
\cdot {10} ^ 4 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" in a separate line if a progressive square
for the given n , c , and d can be constructed from the array elements a ,
otherwise output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, c, d, l))

def func_1(n, c, d, l):
    a = min(l)
    li = []
    for k in range(0, n):
        for h in range(0, n):
            li.append(a + k * c + d * h)
    li.sort()
    l.sort()
    if l == li:
        return 'yes'
    return 'no'



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `c`, `d`, and `l`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500, `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6, and `l` is a list of `n^2` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. The function generates a new list `li` containing `n^2` integers, where each integer is of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for 0 <= k < n and 0 <= h < n, with `a` being the smallest integer in `l`. It then sorts both `l` and `li`. If the sorted list `l` is equal to the sorted list `li`, the function returns 'yes'. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if the given array `b` can be rearranged to form a progressive square of size `n` using the given values `a_{1,1}`, `c`, and `d`.
   - A progressive square is constructed such that each element `a_{i,j}` is calculated as `a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d`.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of `n * n` integers.

3. **Finding the Minimum Element:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum element `a` from the array `l`. This minimum element is assumed to be `a_{1,1}`.

4. **Generating the Progressive Square:**
   - The program generates a list `li` of all elements that should be in the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - This step is correct because it correctly applies the formula to generate all possible elements of the progressive square.

5. **Sorting and Comparing:**
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`.
   - If they match, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array can form the progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the input array `l` might already be in the correct order or might contain duplicate elements.
   - The program also correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form a progressive square. It follows the steps of finding the minimum element, generating the expected elements, sorting both lists, and comparing them. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
