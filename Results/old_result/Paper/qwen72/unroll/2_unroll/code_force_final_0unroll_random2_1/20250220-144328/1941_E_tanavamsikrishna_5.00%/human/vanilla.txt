- The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` is correct for calculating the minimum cost of installing supports in a single row.
   - The sliding window approach used in `func_2` to find the minimum total cost for `k` consecutive rows is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the minimum total cost for building `k` bridges on consecutive rows of the grid.

Correctness:
