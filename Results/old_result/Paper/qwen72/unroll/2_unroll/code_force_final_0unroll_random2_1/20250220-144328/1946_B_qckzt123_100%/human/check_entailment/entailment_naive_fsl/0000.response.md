Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the array `s` is negative and `k` is greater than 1. In such a case, the program incorrectly adds the maximum subarray sum `t` multiple times, which can lead to an incorrect final result. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 2
-1 -2 -3
```
The sum of the array `s` is `-6`, and the maximum subarray sum `t` is `0`. According to the problem description, the best strategy here would be to insert an empty subarray sum (which is `0`) into the array, resulting in a final sum of `-6` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is `999999994`. However, the program will output `0` because it incorrectly adds `t` (which is `0`) multiple times, leading to an incorrect result.
