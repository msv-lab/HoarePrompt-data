Output State: **`n` and `t` retain their initial values, `edges` remains an empty list, `nodes` retains its initial state as a defaultdict with list as the default factory, `start` is now the integer value provided by the user, `empty` remains True, `leaves` is now a deque containing all the nodes that have exactly one neighbor, `moves` is the value returned by `func_1(nodes, start)`.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `t` retain their initial values.
- `edges` remains an empty list.
- `nodes` retains its initial state as a defaultdict with list as the default factory.
- `start` is now the integer value provided by the user.
- `empty` remains True.
- `leaves` is now a deque containing all the nodes that have exactly one neighbor.
- `moves` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1(nodes, start)`. The specific value of `moves` depends on the implementation of `func_1` and the current state of `nodes` and `start`.
