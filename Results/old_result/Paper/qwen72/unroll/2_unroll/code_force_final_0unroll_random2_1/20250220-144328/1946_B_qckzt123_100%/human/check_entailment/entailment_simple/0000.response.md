### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of operations `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` containing `n` integers.

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the sum `s` of the array `a`.

3. **Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the maximum subarray sum `t` using a simple dynamic programming approach. This is done by iterating through the array and keeping a running sum `tmp`. If `tmp` becomes negative, it is reset to zero. The maximum value of `tmp` is stored in `t`.

4. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is calculated as `(s + t) % MOD`. This is because the maximum possible sum after one operation is the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum.

5. **Subsequent Operations:**
   - For each subsequent operation (from 2 to `k`), the program doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` and adds it to `ans`. This is done because the maximum subarray sum can be added to the array in each operation, and the sum of the array will double each time.
   - The result is taken modulo `MOD` to ensure it does not exceed the specified limit.

6. **Output:**
   - The final answer `ans` is printed for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Initial Answer Calculation:**
  - The initial answer `ans` is calculated correctly as the sum of the array plus the maximum subarray sum. This is because the maximum subarray sum can be added to the array in the first operation.

- **Subsequent Operations:**
  - The program correctly doubles the maximum subarray sum `t` for each subsequent operation and adds it to `ans`. This is because each operation can add the maximum subarray sum to the array, and the sum of the array will double each time.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result does not exceed the limit `10^9 + 7`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as negative sums and empty subarrays correctly.
  - The program also handles the case where the array contains only zeros, as the maximum subarray sum will be zero, and the answer will be the sum of the array.

- **Performance:**
  - The program is efficient and should handle the constraints within the given limits. The time complexity is \(O(n)\) for each test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.
