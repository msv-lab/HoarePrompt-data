The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, where `1 <= a, b <= 2 * 10^6`. It then calculates a value `suma` based on the input integers `a` and `b`, and prints `suma - 1`. The function does not modify the values of `n` and `m` as they are not used within the function. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the state of the program is unchanged except for the printed output.
