Reasoning:  
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine which letter, 'A' or 'B', appears most frequently in a string of length 5. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading a string `a` and counting the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. If the count of 'A' is greater than the count of 'B', it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. This logic aligns with the problem description and the example provided. The program also handles the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) and ensures that each string is of length 5, as required.

Correctness: **True**
