The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters for each test case:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, representing the number of sale days.
- `m`: An integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day.
- `k`: An integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ min(nm, 10^9), representing the number of tickets to be bought.
- `a`: A list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

The function returns the minimum total cost required to buy `k` tickets over the `n` sale days, considering the constraints and the prices per ticket for each day.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each with parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and a list `a` of ticket prices. It returns the minimum total cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the maximum tickets purchasable each day `m`.**
