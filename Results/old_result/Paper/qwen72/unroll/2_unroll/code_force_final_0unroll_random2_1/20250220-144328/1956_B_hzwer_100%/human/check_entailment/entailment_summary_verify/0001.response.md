### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list of integers `a` representing the cards in your hand.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Card Frequencies:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` of size `n + 1` to count the frequency of each card number in your hand.
   - It iterates through the list `a` and increments the count for each card number.
   - This part is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Calculating Maximum Points:**
   - The program initializes a variable `ans` to store the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It iterates through the `cnt` list and for each card number `x`, it adds `max(0, x - 1)` to `ans`.
   - The expression `max(0, x - 1)` correctly ensures that if you have only one card of a particular number, you get 0 points for it. If you have two cards of the same number, you get 1 point (since the second card will match the first one on the table).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.
   - This part is correct and aligns with the problem description.

### Analysis:
- **Optimal Strategy:**
  - The program correctly focuses on the maximum points you can score, which is independent of Nene's strategy as long as you play optimally.
  - The logic `max(0, x - 1)` is appropriate because it correctly accounts for the points you can score by playing pairs of cards.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where you have only one card of a particular number (you get 0 points for it).
  - The program also handles the case where you have no pairs at all (you get 0 points).
  - The program handles the case where you have multiple pairs correctly by summing up the points for each pair.

- **Efficiency:**
  - The program efficiently counts the frequencies of the card numbers and calculates the maximum points in linear time, which is suitable given the constraints.
  - The time complexity is O(n) for each test case, and the space complexity is O(n) for the `cnt` list, which is efficient for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score by playing optimally. It handles all the cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.
