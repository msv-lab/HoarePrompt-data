Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that the function should process multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The function should internally handle the input for multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is provided at the beginning and is now an integer with a value between 1 and 1000.**
