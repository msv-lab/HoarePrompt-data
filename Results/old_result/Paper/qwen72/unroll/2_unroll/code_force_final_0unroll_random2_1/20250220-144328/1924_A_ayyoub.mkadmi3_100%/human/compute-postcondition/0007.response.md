The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `s`, `k`, and `n`. 

- `s` is a string of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
- `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 26).
- `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 26).

The function returns a tuple with three elements:
1. A boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` (a derived string from `s`) is greater than or equal to `n * k`.
2. A substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1`, where `r` is some integer.
3. The last character from `s` that was in the alphabet set when the alphabet set had only one character left.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n` (1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26). It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the length of a derived string `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from index `r * k` to the end, and the last character from `s` that was in the alphabet set when the set had only one character left.**
