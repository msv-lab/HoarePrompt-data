You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Chamo gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Mocha doesn't like arrays containing different numbers, so Mocha decides to
use magic to change the array. Mocha can perform the following three-step
operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  1. Choose indices l and r (1 \leq l < r \leq n ) 
  2. Let x be the median^\dagger of the subarray [a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r] 
  3. Set all values a_l, a_{l+1},\ldots, a_r to x 

Suppose a=[1,2,3,4,5] initially:

  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(3,4) in the first operation, then x=3 , the array will be changed into a=[1,2,3,3,5] . 
  * If Mocha chooses (l,r)=(1,3) in the first operation, then x=2 , the array will be changed into a=[2,2,2,4,5] . 

Mocha will perform the operation until the array contains only the same
number. Mocha wants to know what is the maximum possible value of this number.

^\dagger The median in an array b of length m is an element that occupies
position number \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor after we sort the elements in
non-decreasing order. For example, the median of [3,1,4,1,5] is 3 and the
median of [5,25,20,24] is 20 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the maximum value of the number.

Example

Input

    2
    
    2
    
    1 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 3 4 5

Output

    1
    4
    
Note

In the first test case, a=[1,2] . Mocha can only choose the interval
(l,r)=(1,2) . The array will be changed to a=[1,1] . Therefore, the answer is
1 .

In the second test case, Mocha can perform the following operations:

  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(4,5) , then a=[1,2,3,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(3,5) , then a=[1,2,4,4,4] . 
  * Choose the interval (l,r)=(1,5) , then a=[4,4,4,4,4] . 

The array contains only the same number, which is 4 . It can be proven that
the maximum value of the final number cannot be greater than 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        print(max)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) representing the length of the array a, and a list of n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a. The total number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        max = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if min(a[i], a[i - 1]) > max:
                max = min(a[i], a[i - 1])
        
        print(max)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum value of the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the array a. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are modified during the execution of the loop, but their final state is not directly relevant to the output. The output is a series of integers, each corresponding to the result of one test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. For each test case, the function computes and prints the maximum value among the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` in an undefined state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible value that all elements in the array can be changed to using the described operations.
   - The operations involve selecting a subarray, finding its median, and setting all elements in that subarray to the median.
   - The median of a subarray of length \( m \) is the element at position \( \lfloor \frac{m+1}{2} \rfloor \) after sorting the subarray.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The maximum possible value that all elements can be changed to is the maximum value among the minimum pairs of adjacent elements in the array.
   - This is because the median of any subarray will always be at least as large as the smallest element in that subarray. Therefore, the smallest element in any subarray can be used to set the entire subarray to a value that is at least as large as the smallest element.
   - By iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum value among the minimum pairs of adjacent elements, we can determine the maximum possible value that the entire array can be changed to.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array elements \( a \).
   - It initializes a variable `max` to 0, which will store the maximum value among the minimum pairs of adjacent elements.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \( n-1 \) (i.e., from the second element to the last element).
   - For each pair of adjacent elements \( (a[i-1], a[i]) \), it computes the minimum value and updates `max` if this minimum value is greater than the current `max`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `max` for each test case.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum value among the minimum pairs of adjacent elements.
   - This approach ensures that the maximum possible value that the entire array can be changed to is found, as explained in the key insight.
   - The program handles the input and output format as specified in the problem description.
