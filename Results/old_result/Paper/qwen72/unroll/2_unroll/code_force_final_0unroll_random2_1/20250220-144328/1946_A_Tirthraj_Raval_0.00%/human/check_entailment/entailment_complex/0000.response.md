### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
   - An operation consists of choosing an integer \( i \) and increasing \( a_i \) by 1.
   - The median is defined as the element at index \( \lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil \) in the sorted array.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a`.
   - It calculates the index `p` of the median element as \( \left( \frac{n + 1}{2} \right) - 1 \).
   - It then counts the number of occurrences of the median element `a[p]` and prints this count.

3. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The program counts the number of occurrences of the median element, but this does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
   - To increase the median, we need to find the smallest number of operations required to make the median element greater than its current value.
   - The correct approach would be to find the smallest number greater than the median and calculate the difference between this number and the median, then sum the differences for the necessary elements to move the median to the next value.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - After sorting the array, identify the median element.
   - Find the smallest element greater than the median.
   - Calculate the number of operations required to make the median element equal to this next element.
   - This involves summing the differences between the median and the next element for the necessary elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it only counts the occurrences of the median element, which is not the required output. The correct output should be the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
