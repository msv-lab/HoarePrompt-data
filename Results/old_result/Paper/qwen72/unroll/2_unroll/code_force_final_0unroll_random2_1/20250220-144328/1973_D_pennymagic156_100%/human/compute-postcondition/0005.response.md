To determine the output state after all the executions of the loop, let's break down the loop and understand its behavior.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
- `v` is the value of `i` when `v == n` for the first time, or `v` is 1 if no such `i` is found.

### Loop Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(1, n // k + 1)`):**
   - This loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.

2. **Inner Loop (`while cnt and l < n + 1`):**
   - `cnt` is initialized to `k` and `l` is initialized to `1`.
   - The loop continues as long as `cnt` is greater than 0 and `l` is less than `n + 1`.
   - Inside the loop, it prints a query and updates `l` using the result of `func_2() + 1`.
   - `cnt` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Condition after Inner Loop:**
   - If `cnt` becomes 0 and `l` equals `n + 1`, it prints a final result and calls `func_2()` before returning.

### Variables Affected:
- `i` is incremented in the outer loop.
- `cnt` and `l` are reset and updated in the inner loop.
- `v` is used in the inner loop but is not modified.

### Final Output State:
- The outer loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n // k`.
- For each `i`, the inner loop runs `k` times, updating `l` and decrementing `cnt`.
- If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` equals `n + 1` for any `i`, the loop prints a result and returns, terminating the function.

Since the loop returns when the condition `cnt == 0 and l == n + 1` is met, the final state of the variables will be:
- `i` will be the value at which the loop returns.
- `cnt` will be 0.
- `l` will be `n + 1`.
- `v` will remain unchanged.

### Natural Language Description:
The loop will iterate through values of `i` from 1 to `n // k`. For each `i`, it will perform `k` iterations of the inner loop, updating `l` and decrementing `cnt`. If `cnt` reaches 0 and `l` equals `n + 1` for any `i`, the loop will print a result and return, setting `i` to the value at which this condition is met, `cnt` to 0, and `l` to `n + 1`. The value of `v` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is the value at which the loop returns, `cnt` is 0, `l` is `n + 1`, and `v` remains unchanged.**
