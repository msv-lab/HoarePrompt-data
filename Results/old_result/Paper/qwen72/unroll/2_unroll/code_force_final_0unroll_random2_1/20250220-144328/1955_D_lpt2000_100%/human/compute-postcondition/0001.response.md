The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `nabors`. For the loop to execute, `nabors` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized before the loop starts, as it will be assigned values by the `range` function during each iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `nabors` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `nabors` must be greater than 0**
