Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1 in this version). It then reads the edges of the tree and constructs a deque to represent the tree as an array-like structure. This is appropriate because the tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, making it a linear structure.

2. **Tree Construction**: The program constructs the tree by adding nodes to the deque based on the edges. It correctly handles the conditions for inserting nodes at the beginning or the end of the deque. This ensures that the tree is represented as a linear sequence of nodes, which is necessary for the game logic.

3. **Starting Node**: The program reads the starting node for the round and finds its index in the deque. This is necessary to determine the number of moves each player can make.

4. **Move Calculation**: The program calculates the number of moves each player can make from the starting node. It considers the minimum number of moves to reach the beginning or the end of the deque. This is a correct approach because the game ends when a player cannot move to an inactive neighbor, and the leaves of the tree (the start and end of the deque) are the only points where this can happen.

5. **Winning Condition**: The program checks if the number of moves available to any player is odd. If at least one of the moves is odd, Ron wins because he makes the first move and can force an odd number of moves. If both moves are even, Hermione wins because she will always be the one to make the last move in an even sequence of moves.

6. **Output**: The program prints "Ron" if the number of moves is odd and "Hermione" if the number of moves is even. This is consistent with the problem's requirements.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
