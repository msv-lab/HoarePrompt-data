The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case is a string of length 5 consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. The input to the function is not directly provided in the function definition but is expected to be read from standard input. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 32, and all strings in the test cases are distinct.
