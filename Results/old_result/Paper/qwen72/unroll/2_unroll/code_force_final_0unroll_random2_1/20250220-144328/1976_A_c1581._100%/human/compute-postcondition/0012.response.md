Postcondition: **The loop completes without returning `False`, and the `digits` and `letters` lists remain unchanged. `sortedPassword` is a string formed by concatenating all elements in the `digits` list followed by all elements in the `letters` list, and `sortedPassword` is not equal to `password`.**
