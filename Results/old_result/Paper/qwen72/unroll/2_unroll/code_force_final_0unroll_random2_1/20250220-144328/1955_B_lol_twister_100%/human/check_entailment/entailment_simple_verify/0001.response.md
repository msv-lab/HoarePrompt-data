### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining if the given array `b` can be rearranged to form a progressive square of size `n` using the given values `c` and `d`.
   - A progressive square is constructed such that each element `a_{i,j}` is calculated as `a_{1,1} + (i-1) * c + (j-1) * d`.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of `n * n` integers.
   - This part of the program is correct.

3. **Finding the Minimum Element:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum element `a` from the array `l`. This minimum element is assumed to be `a_{1,1}`.
   - This is a valid assumption because the smallest element in the array must be the starting point of the progressive square.

4. **Generating the Progressive Square:**
   - The program generates a list `li` of all elements that should be in the progressive square using the formula `a + k * c + d * h` for `k` and `h` ranging from `0` to `n-1`.
   - This step is correct because it correctly applies the formula to generate all possible elements of the progressive square.

5. **Sorting and Comparing:**
   - Both the generated list `li` and the input list `l` are sorted.
   - The program then checks if the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`.
   - If they match, it returns 'yes', indicating that the array can form the progressive square. Otherwise, it returns 'no'.
   - This approach is valid because sorting both lists and comparing them ensures that the elements are the same and in the correct order.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the input array `l` might already be in the correct order or might contain duplicate elements.
   - The program also correctly handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 500.
  - `c` and `d` are integers such that 1 <= c, d <= 10^6.
  - `l` is a list of n^2 integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9.
  - This state is correctly described and matches the problem constraints.

- **State after generating the progressive square:**
  - `a` is the smallest integer in the list `l`.
  - `li` is a list of n^2 integers where each integer is of the form `a + k * c + d * h` for 0 <= k < n and 0 <= h < n.
  - This state is correctly described and matches the logic of generating the progressive square.

- **State after sorting and comparing:**
  - `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers.
  - `li` is a sorted list of n^2 integers.
  - The program correctly compares the two sorted lists and returns 'yes' if they match, otherwise 'no'.
  - This state is correctly described and matches the logic of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the given array can form a progressive square. It follows the steps of finding the minimum element, generating the expected elements, sorting both lists, and comparing them. The annotated code confirms that the program's state and behavior are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**

The original assessment was accurate, and the program is correct.
