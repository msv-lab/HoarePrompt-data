The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of integers. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `x` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤ k, x ≤ n. The list `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and a list `a` of integers. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it uses `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` to produce a result. The exact output for each test case is not specified.**
