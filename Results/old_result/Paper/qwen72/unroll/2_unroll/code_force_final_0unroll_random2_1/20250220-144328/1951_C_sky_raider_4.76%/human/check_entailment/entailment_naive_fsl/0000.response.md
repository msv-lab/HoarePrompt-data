Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the calculation of the total cost. Specifically, the variable `c` is initialized as `k * k / 2`, which is incorrect and does not follow the problem description. The correct approach should be to initialize `c` as 0 and then calculate the cost based on the number of tickets bought each day and the price increase rule.

Additionally, the logic inside the loop is flawed. The program does not correctly handle the price increase for subsequent days after purchasing tickets. The price increase should be applied to all subsequent days, but the program does not reflect this.

Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3
8 6 4 2
```

Expected Output:
```
10
```

Actual Output:
```
11
```

The program incorrectly calculates the total cost, leading to an incorrect result. The correct approach should be to buy tickets in a way that minimizes the total cost, taking into account the price increase for subsequent days.
