Output State: `a` is a list where the elements at the indices from the middle to the start of the list and their corresponding mirrored indices from the end to the middle of the list are updated with the values calculated from the `odds` list. Specifically, for each `x` in `odds`, if `idx` is the middle index, `a[idx]` is set to `x`. Otherwise, `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to `(x - prev) // 2`. The `prev` variable is updated to the current `x` and `idx` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The final value of `idx` is -1, and `prev` is the last element of the `odds` list.
