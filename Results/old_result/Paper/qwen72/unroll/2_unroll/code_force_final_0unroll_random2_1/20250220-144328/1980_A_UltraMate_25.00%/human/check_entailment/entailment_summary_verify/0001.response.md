### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties:**
   - The program uses the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Missing Problems:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the string `p = 'ABCDEF'` (which should be `p = 'ABCDEFG'` to include all difficulty levels from 'A' to 'G').
   - For each difficulty level `i` in `p`, it checks if `i` is not in `hmp` (the counter of the string `s`). If `i` is not in `hmp`, it means there are no problems of that difficulty level, so `m` additional problems are needed for each of the `m` rounds.
   - If `i` is in `hmp` but the count is less than `m`, it calculates the number of additional problems needed to meet the requirement of `m` problems for each round and adds this to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Missing 'G' in `p`:**
  - The string `p` is defined as `p = 'ABCDEF'`, which means it does not include the difficulty level 'G'. This will result in the program not correctly accounting for the 'G' difficulty level, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
To fix the issue, we need to include 'G' in the string `p`.

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'  # Include 'G' in the string
        hmp = Counter(s)
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
            elif hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        print(ans)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected to include 'G' in the string `p`.
- **False** if the program remains as is, because it will not correctly handle the 'G' difficulty level.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program is incorrect because it does not include the 'G' difficulty level in the string `p`, which is necessary to ensure all difficulty levels are accounted for. Therefore, the final evaluation is **False**.
