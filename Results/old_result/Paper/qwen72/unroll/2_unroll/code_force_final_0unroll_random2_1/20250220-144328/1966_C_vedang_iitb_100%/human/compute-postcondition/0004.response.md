Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads a list of integers `a` representing piles of stones. It determines the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') based on the following rules: If the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sorted list of stones (`mexsize`) is greater than the maximum stone size (`maxsize`), the winner is 'Alice' if `mexsize` is even, and 'Bob' if `mexsize` is odd. Otherwise, the winner is 'Alice' if `mexsize` is odd, and 'Bob' if `mexsize` is even. The function prints the winner for each test case and does not return any value. The input list `stones` is not modified. **
