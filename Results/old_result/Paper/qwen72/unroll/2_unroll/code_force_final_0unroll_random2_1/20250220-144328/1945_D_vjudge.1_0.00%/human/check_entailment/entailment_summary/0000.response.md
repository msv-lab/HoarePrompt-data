### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input, followed by two lists `lista_A` and `lista_B` of length `n`. It then reverses both lists.
   - **Processing**:
     - The function initializes `soma_b` and `pref` to 0.
     - It iterates over the first `n - k` elements of the reversed lists. If `lista_A[i]` is less than `lista_B[i]`, it adds `soma_b` and `lista_A[i]` to `pref`, and resets `soma_b` to 0. Otherwise, it adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
     - After this, it initializes `resultado` to infinity and iterates over the last `k` elements of the reversed lists. For each element, it updates `resultado` to the minimum of its current value and the sum of `pref`, `soma_b`, and `lista_A[i]`, and then adds `lista_B[i]` to `soma_b`.
   - **Output**: The function prints the minimum value of `resultado`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `numero_testes` from the input.
   - **Processing**: It calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Output**: The function does not return any value, but `func_1` prints the result for each test case.

### Analysis:
- **Reversing the Lists**: The lists are reversed to process the queue from the end to the beginning, which is a valid approach since Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward.
- **Prefix and Suffix Sums**: The function correctly calculates the prefix sum of `lista_A` and the suffix sum of `lista_B` for the first `n - k` elements, and then iterates over the last `k` elements to find the minimum cost.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation in the second loop is correct. It considers the cost of moving to each of the last `k` positions and updates `resultado` to the minimum cost.
- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**: `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each one.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes the input data, calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people, and prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**
