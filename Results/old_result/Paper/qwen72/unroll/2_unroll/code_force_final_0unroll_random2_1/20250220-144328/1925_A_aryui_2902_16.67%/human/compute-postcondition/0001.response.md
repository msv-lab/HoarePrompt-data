Initial State: The function should take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values provided by the user as input, where the input is split and converted to integers.

```
s = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'
```

Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code snippet provided assigns the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` to the variable `s`. This does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which are still assigned based on user input.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers provided by the user, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26, `s` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'.**
