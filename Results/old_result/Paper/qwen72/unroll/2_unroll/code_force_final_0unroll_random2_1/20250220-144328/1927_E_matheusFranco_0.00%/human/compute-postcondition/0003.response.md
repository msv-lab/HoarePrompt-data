Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1.**

The code snippet assigns the value 1 to the variable `idx_v`. The values of `n` and `k` remain as the initial integer inputs with the constraints that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even. The list `permutation` remains a list of `n` zeros, and `idx` remains 0. The new variable `idx_v` is now set to 1.
