### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - This part of the code is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set to store the values of `k` that must be excluded (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the minimum upper bound (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the maximum lower bound (type 1 constraints).
   - These initializations are appropriate for the problem, ensuring that `ax` starts as a large value and `bx` starts as a small value.

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the function reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`.
   - This processing is correct and ensures that `bx` and `ax` are updated to reflect the tightest possible bounds for `k`.

4. **Checking Valid Range**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the function appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - This check is correct and necessary to handle cases where the constraints are contradictory.

5. **Counting Excluded Values**:
   - If there is a valid range (`bx < ax`), the function initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates through the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
   - This calculation is correct. The range `[bx, ax]` is inclusive, so the total number of integers in this range is `ax - bx + 1`. Subtracting `tmp` (the number of excluded values) gives the correct count of valid integers.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.
   - This matches the required output format.

### Analysis:
- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The function correctly identifies the maximum lower bound (`bx`) and the minimum upper bound (`ax`).
  - This ensures that the range `[bx, ax]` is the valid range for `k`.

- **Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The function correctly excludes the values that must not be equal to `k` by adding them to the set `cx`.
  - It then counts how many of these excluded values fall within the valid range.
  - The use of a set for `cx` ensures that the exclusion values are unique and that the operations (addition and membership check) are efficient.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `bx >= ax`, the function correctly returns 0, indicating no valid integers.
  - The function correctly handles the case where there are multiple constraints of type 3 that fall within the valid range.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of a set for `cx` ensures that the exclusion values are unique and that the operations (addition and membership check) are efficient.
  - The overall complexity is O(n) per test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all types of constraints and edge cases appropriately.
