Output State: **`n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 â‰¤ `a_i` < 2^30.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `x` are updated to the values returned by the function `func_3()`.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and still contains `n` integers, each of which is between 0 and 2^30 - 1.
