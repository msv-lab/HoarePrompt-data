### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program defines several functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) to handle input. However, the main function `func_5` is the one that processes the actual problem.
   - `func_3` reads the first line of each test case, which contains `n` and `x`.
   - `func_1` reads the second line of each test case, which contains the array `a`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the bits of `x` from the most significant bit (29) to the least significant bit (0).
   - For each bit position `i`:
     - It checks if the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 (`u == 0`).
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is odd (`v % 2`), it returns `-1` because it's impossible to satisfy the condition.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 0 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is even, it tries to split the array into segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 (`u == 1`):
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is even (`v % 2 == 0`), it continues to the next bit.
       - If the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is odd (`v % 2`), it counts the number of segments where the `i`-th bit of the XOR of each segment is 0 and updates the answer.
     - If the `i`-th bit of `x` is 1 and the sum of the `i`-th bits of the array `a` is 0, it breaks the loop.

3. **Segment Splitting**:
   - The program uses a variable `op` to keep track of the XOR of the `i`-th bits of the current segment.
   - It uses `ai` to keep track of the cumulative XOR of the values in the current segment.
   - When `op` becomes 0, it means the current segment can be split, and it appends `ai` to the list `t` and resets `ai`.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - After processing all bits, the program returns the maximum value between the current `ans` and the length of the array `a`.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the constraints and input format.
- The logic for checking the `i`-th bit of `x` and the sum of the `i`-th bits of `a` is sound.
- The segment splitting logic is correct, as it ensures that the XOR of each segment's `i`-th bits is 0 when `x`'s `i`-th bit is 0.
- The program correctly updates the answer and handles the case where no valid segments can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented.
