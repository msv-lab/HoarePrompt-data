Output State: **The function `I` is defined as a lambda function that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. The initial state remains unchanged except for the addition of this function.**

The function operates in an interactive environment where the input is provided through queries and responses. The input includes multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) representing the length of a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1. The function can make at most 3n queries to find indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The total sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
