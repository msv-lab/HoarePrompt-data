Output State: **The function should accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000. `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers.**
