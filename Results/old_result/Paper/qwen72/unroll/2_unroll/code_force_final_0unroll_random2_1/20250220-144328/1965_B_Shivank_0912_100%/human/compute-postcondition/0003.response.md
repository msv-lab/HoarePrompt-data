The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n.

The function is expected to return a value based on these parameters. Since the output is not explicitly described, we can infer that the function might be performing some operation that depends on `n` and `k`, but the exact nature of the return value is not specified. However, given the context, it is reasonable to assume that the function returns a result that is specific to the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n. The function returns a value that depends on the values of `n` and `k`.**
