### Reasoning

The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Let's break down the issues and validate the assessment step by step.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` processes the string `s` to create `s1` and `s2`.
   - `s1` is a string that contains all characters from `s` that were in the initial set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - `s2` is a string that contains the last character from `s` which was in the alphabet set when the set had only one character left.
   - The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1` (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2`.

2. **Logic Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`.
   - The construction of `s2` is not aligned with the problem's requirement to find a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence.
   - The logic to determine the boolean value `b` is flawed. It checks if `len(s1) >= n * k`, which is not a sufficient condition to ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences.

3. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - **First Test Case:**
     - Input: `2 2 4 abba`
     - Expected Output: `YES`
     - Actual Output: `YES`
     - The program correctly identifies that all possible strings of length 2 (aa, ab, ba, bb) are subsequences of `abba`.
   - **Second Test Case:**
     - Input: `2 2 3 abb`
     - Expected Output: `NO\naa`
     - Actual Output: `NO\naa`
     - The program correctly identifies that `aa` is not a subsequence of `abb`.
   - **Third Test Case:**
     - Input: `3 3 10 aabbccabab`
     - Expected Output: `NO\nccc`
     - Actual Output: `NO\nabc`
     - The program incorrectly outputs `abc` as the string that does not occur as a subsequence, but `abc` is actually a subsequence of `aabbccabab`. The correct output should be `ccc` or any other string of length 3 formed using the first 3 alphabets that does not occur as a subsequence.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, one needs to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, print `NO` followed by that string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, print `YES`.

### Final Evaluation
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify and output a string of length `n` that does not occur as a subsequence in the third test case.

Final: **False**
