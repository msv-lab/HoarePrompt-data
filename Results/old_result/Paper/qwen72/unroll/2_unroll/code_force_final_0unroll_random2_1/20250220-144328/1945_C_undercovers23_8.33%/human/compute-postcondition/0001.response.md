The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is an input integer, but it does not specify that `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
