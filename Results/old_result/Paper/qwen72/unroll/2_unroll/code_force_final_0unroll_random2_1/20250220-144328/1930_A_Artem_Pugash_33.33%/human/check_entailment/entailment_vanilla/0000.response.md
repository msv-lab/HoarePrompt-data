### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers (`numInteger`), which is always `2n`.
   - It then reads the list of integers (`numbers`), splits the input string into a list, and sorts the list in ascending order.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting the list in ascending order ensures that the smallest numbers are always considered first when pairs are formed. This is crucial because the goal is to maximize the score by adding the minimum of each pair, and the smallest numbers should be paired with the next smallest numbers to maximize the sum of the minimums.

3. **Pairing and Summing**:
   - The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly pop the first two elements from the sorted list (`a` and `b`).
   - It adds the minimum of these two elements to the score (`suma`).
   - This process continues until the list is empty, which will happen after `n` iterations because `2n` elements are removed in pairs.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all pairs for a test case, the program prints the final score (`suma`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly, as shown in the first test case.
   - It also handles cases where all numbers are the same, as shown in the third test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest two numbers and adding the smaller of the two to the score.
- The sorting step ensures that the pairs are formed optimally, and the `while` loop correctly processes all pairs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
