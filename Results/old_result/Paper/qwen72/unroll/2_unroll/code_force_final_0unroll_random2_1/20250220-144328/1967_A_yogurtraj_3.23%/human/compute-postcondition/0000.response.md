The only objects in the loop head are the variables `ii` and the result of `int(input())`, which we can refer to as `t` (the number of test cases). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `ii` should start from 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, representing the number of test cases.
- `ii` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but the loop will initialize it to 0.

To ensure the loop executes, `t` must be at least 1, and `ii` will be 0 at the start of the first iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `ii` is 0**
