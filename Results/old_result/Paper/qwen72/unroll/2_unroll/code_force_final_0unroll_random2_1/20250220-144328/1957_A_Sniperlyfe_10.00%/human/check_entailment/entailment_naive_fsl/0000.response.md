Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only counts the number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed, but it does not consider the possibility of forming other regular polygons with different numbers of sides (e.g., triangles, pentagons, etc.).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```
The expected output is `1` because we can form a square with the four sticks of length 3. However, the program will output `0` because it only checks for the possibility of forming squares and does not consider other regular polygons.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed for all possible side counts (3 or more) and return the sum of the maximum number of polygons for each side count.
