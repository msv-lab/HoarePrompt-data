To determine if the `while` loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that the condition `low <= high` is true for the first iteration. Let's analyze the given state step by step:

- `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\).
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`.

For the loop condition `low <= high` to be true:
- `low` is 0.
- `high` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Given that `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`, and both `n` and `b` are at least 1, `high` will always be at least 1 (since the minimum of two numbers, each at least 1, is at least 1).

Therefore, the condition `low <= high` will always be true because `low` is 0 and `high` is at least 1.

Since the loop condition is already satisfied, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `n`, `a`, `b` <= 10^9; `low` is 0; `high` is the minimum value between `n` and `b`; `max_profit` is 0**
