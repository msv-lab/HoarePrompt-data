Output State: **The program returns False.** 

In this scenario, the program explicitly returns the boolean value `False`. The variables `digits`, `letters`, and `sortedPassword` remain unchanged and are not part of the return value. The condition that `sortedPassword` is not equal to `password` does not affect the return value since the return statement is unconditional.
