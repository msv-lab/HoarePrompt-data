#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and the two binary strings representing the rows of the grid. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the binary strings are of length `n` and consist of characters '0' or '1'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    a = []
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(2):
        a.append(input())
        
    #State: The list `a` contains two input strings, each of length `n`, representing the rows of the grid. The other variables (`t`, `n`) remain unchanged.
    s = []
    x = 0
    y = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1':
            y = i
        
        if a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0':
            s = a[0][:i + 1] + a[1][i:]
            x = i
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged. The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The list `s` is either an empty list or a modified version of the list `a` based on the loop conditions. The variable `x` is either `n - 1` or the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met. The variable `y` is the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or it remains 0 if the condition was never met.
    t = 1
    for i in range(y, x):
        if a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]:
            t = x - i + 1
            break
        
    #State: The list `a` remains unchanged. The variable `t` is either 1 or `x - i + 1` where `i` is the first index in the range `y` to `x` (exclusive) that satisfies the condition `a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1]`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. The list `s` remains either an empty list or a modified version of the list `a` based on the loop conditions. The variable `x` remains either `n - 1` or the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '1' and a[1][i] == '0'` was met. The variable `y` remains the index `i` where the loop condition `a[0][i + 1] == '0' and a[1][i] == '1'` was met, or it remains 0 if the condition was never met.
    print(s, sep='')
    #This is printed: [elements of s concatenated together]
    print(t)
    #This is printed: t (where t is either 1 or x - i + 1, depending on whether an index i is found in the range y to x (exclusive) such that a[1][i:x] == s[i + 1:x + 1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and two binary strings of length `n` from the user. It then processes these strings to determine a modified string `s` and an integer `t`. The modified string `s` is a combination of the two input strings based on specific conditions, and `t` is a value calculated based on the positions where these conditions are met. The function prints the modified string `s` (if it is not empty) and the integer `t`. The function does not return any values, and its behavior is undefined if `n` is less than 2 or greater than 2 · 10^5, or if the input strings are not of length `n`.
