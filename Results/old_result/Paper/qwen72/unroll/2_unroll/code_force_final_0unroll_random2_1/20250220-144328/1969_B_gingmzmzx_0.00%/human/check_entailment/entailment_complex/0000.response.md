### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function starts by reading an integer `n` which denotes the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Zeroes**: The variable `zeroes` is correctly initialized to the count of zeros in the string `s`.

3. **Counting and Cost Calculation**:
   - The function uses a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far in the string.
   - The variable `ans` is used to accumulate the total cost of the operations.
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is 0, the function increments `cnt[0]` and adds 1 to `ans` if there are any 1s before the current position (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is 1, the function increments `cnt[1]` and adds the number of remaining zeroes to `ans` (i.e., `zeroes - cnt[0]`).

4. **Output**: After processing each string, the function prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum total cost to make the string sorted in non-descending order.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering the cost of moving each 1 to the right of all 0s and the cost of moving each 0 to the left of all 1s.
   - The logic ensures that the total cost is minimized by only counting the necessary shifts.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the string is already sorted (e.g., "0000") by outputting 0, which is correct.
   - The function also handles the case where the string has a mix of 0s and 1s and calculates the correct cost (e.g., "101011" results in 5).

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.
