### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(T\) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \(a\) and \(b\).

3. **Loop Structure**:
   - The program uses a single loop to iterate over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - The loop for \(b\) starts from 1, which is correct based on the problem statement.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The program does not use a nested loop to check all pairs \((a, b)\). Instead, it uses a formula to calculate the number of valid pairs.
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is used to determine the number of valid pairs for each \(b = i\).

5. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum of valid pairs and prints it.
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is derived from the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This formula is based on the observation that for a fixed \(b = i\), the number of valid \(a\) values can be determined by the given condition.

6. **Correct Logic**:
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) is derived from the condition \(a + i\) is a multiple of \(i \cdot \gcd(a, i)\).
   - For a fixed \(b = i\), the condition \(a + i\) is a multiple of \(i \cdot \gcd(a, i)\) can be simplified to \(a\) being a multiple of \(i\). This is because \(i \cdot \gcd(a, i)\) is a multiple of \(i\), and \(a + i\) being a multiple of \(i\) implies \(a\) is a multiple of \(i\).
   - The formula \((a - i * (i - 1)) // i ** 2 + 1\) correctly counts the number of multiples of \(i\) within the range \([1, a]\).

7. **Example Verification**:
   - For the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the program should find pairs like \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\).
   - The program's current logic correctly identifies these pairs by using the formula to count valid \(a\) values for each \(b\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct because it correctly iterates over all possible values of \(b\) and uses a valid formula to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each \(b\). The original assessment was incorrect in stating that the program does not correctly iterate over all possible values of \(b\) and that the logic used to count valid pairs is flawed.

Final: **True**
