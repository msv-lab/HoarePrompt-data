Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads two strings of digits from the user input, modifies them according to specific rules, and prints the modified strings. The function ensures that for the first position where the digits in the two strings differ, if the digit in the first string is less than the digit in the second string, they are swapped. After the first swap or if the digit in the first string is greater than the digit in the second string at any position, the digits will be swapped for all subsequent positions where the first string's digit is greater than the second string's digit. The function does not handle multiple test cases or return the sum of the integers represented by the strings. **
