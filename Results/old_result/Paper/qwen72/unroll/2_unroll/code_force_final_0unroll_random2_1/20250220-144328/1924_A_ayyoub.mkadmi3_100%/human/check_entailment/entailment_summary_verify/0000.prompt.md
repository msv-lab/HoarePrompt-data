You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
t = int(input())
OUT = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    (b, s1, s2) = func_1(s, k, n)
    if not b:
        OUT.append('No')
        i = 97
        while i <= k + 97:
            if chr(i) not in s1:
                break
            i += 1
        be9i = chr(i) * (n - len(s2))
        OUT.append(s2 + be9i)
    else:
        OUT.append('Yes')
for i in OUT:
    print(i)

def func_1(s, k, n):
    s1 = ''
    s2 = ''
    alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
    for i in s:
        if i in alphabet:
            if len(alphabet) != 1:
                alphabet.remove(i)
            else:
                s2 += i
                alphabet = {chr(i) for i in range(97, 97 + k)}
            s1 += i
    r = len(s1) // k
    return (len(s1) >= n * k, s1[r * k:], s2)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` of length `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000) comprising only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, and two integers `k` and `n` (1 ≤ k, n ≤ 26). It processes the string `s` to create a new string `s1` that contains all characters from `s` that were in the initial set of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Additionally, it creates a string `s2` that contains the last character from `s` which was in the alphabet set when the set had only one character left. The function returns a tuple with three elements: a boolean indicating whether the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`, a substring of `s1` starting from the index `r * k` to the end of `s1` (where `r` is the integer division of the length of `s1` by `k`), and the string `s2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. 

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
3
2 2 4
abba
2 2 3
abb
3 3 10
aabbccabab
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
ccc
```

**Actual Output:**
```
YES
NO
aa
NO
abc
```

In the third test case, the program outputs `abc` as the string that does not occur as a subsequence, but `abc` is actually a subsequence of `aabbccabab`. The correct output should be `ccc` or any other string of length 3 formed using the first 3 alphabets that does not occur as a subsequence.

The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` where it incorrectly constructs the string `s2` and does not properly check all possible combinations of strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` alphabets.
