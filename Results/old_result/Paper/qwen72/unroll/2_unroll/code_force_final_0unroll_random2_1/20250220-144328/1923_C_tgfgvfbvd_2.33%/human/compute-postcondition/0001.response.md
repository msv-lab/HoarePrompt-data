Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and q are integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5, c is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9, and for each query, l_i and r_i are integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The loop has processed all test cases, and for each query, it has printed 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop.**
