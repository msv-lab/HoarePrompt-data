Reasoning:  
The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The program only handles specific cases for `n` (1, 2, 3, and 4) and prints a hardcoded checkerboard pattern for each of these cases. However, the problem description requires the program to handle any integer `n` within the range 1 to 20 and generate the appropriate checkerboard pattern dynamically.

The program fails to handle cases where `n` is greater than 4, as it only prints 'No esta en el rango' for such cases. This is incorrect because the problem does not specify that the program should only handle `n` up to 4; it should handle any valid `n` (1 to 20).

Additionally, the program does not follow the correct output format for `n > 4`, which should be a 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard pattern. The program should generate this pattern dynamically based on the value of `n`.

Given these issues, the program is not correct for the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
