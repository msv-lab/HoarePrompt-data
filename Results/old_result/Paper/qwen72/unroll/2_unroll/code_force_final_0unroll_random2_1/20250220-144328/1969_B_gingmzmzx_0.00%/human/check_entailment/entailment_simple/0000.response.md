### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it to a list of integers.

2. **Counting Zeroes**:
   - The variable `zeroes` is used to count the number of `0`s in the string `s`.

3. **Counting Substrings**:
   - The variable `cnt` is a list of two elements, where `cnt[0]` keeps track of the number of `0`s encountered so far, and `cnt[1]` keeps track of the number of `1`s encountered so far.

4. **Calculating the Minimum Cost**:
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the total cost.
   - For each character `c` in the string `s`:
     - If `c` is `0`, the cost is incremented by 1 if there are any `1`s before it (`cnt[1] > 0`).
     - If `c` is `1`, the cost is incremented by the number of `0`s that have not been encountered yet (`zeroes - cnt[0]`).

5. **Output**:
   - After processing each string, the total cost `ans` is printed.

### Analysis:
- The logic of the program is to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
- The program correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.
- The cost calculation is based on the number of `1`s and `0`s and their positions in the string, which aligns with the problem's requirement to make the string sorted in non-descending order.
- The program ensures that the cost is minimized by considering the optimal number of shifts needed to move `1`s to the end of the string and `0`s to the beginning.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum cost to sort a binary string using cyclic shifts. The input and output handling is also correct according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
