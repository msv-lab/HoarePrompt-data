### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Collection:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then collects the test cases into a list `cases`. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case in the `cases` list.
   - For each test case, it creates sets `unique_a` and `unique_b` from the lists `a` and `b` to identify unique elements.
   - It then filters these sets to include only elements that are less than or equal to `k`, creating `relevant_a` and `relevant_b`.
   - The sets `only_a` and `only_b` are created to identify elements that are unique to `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - The set `both` is created to identify elements that are present in both `a` and `b`.

3. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - The program checks if the number of elements in `only_a` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case. This is because if `a` has more than `k // 2` elements that are not in `b`, it is impossible to choose `k // 2` elements from `a` and `k // 2` elements from `b` to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
   - Similarly, it checks if the number of elements in `only_b` is greater than `k // 2`. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
   - It then calculates the total number of distinct elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` by summing the lengths of `only_a`, `only_b`, and `both`.
   - If the total number of distinct elements is less than `k`, it appends 'NO' to the results list. This is because if there are fewer than `k` distinct elements, it is impossible to cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results list, indicating that it is possible to choose the elements in the required way.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is correct according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly `k // 2` elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to `k` is included. The conditions and logic used in the function `func_1` are appropriate and follow the problem constraints and requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
