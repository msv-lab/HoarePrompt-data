Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each containing a set of constraints represented by pairs (a, x). For each test case, it calculates the number of integers that satisfy all the constraints and prints this number. The constraints are of three types: type 1 (big) specifies a maximum value, type 2 (less) specifies a minimum value, and type 3 (no) specifies values that must be excluded. The function prints 0 if no integers satisfy the constraints. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the printed output. **
