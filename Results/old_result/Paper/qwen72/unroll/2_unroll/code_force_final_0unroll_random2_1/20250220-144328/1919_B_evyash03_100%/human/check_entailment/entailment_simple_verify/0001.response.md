Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to split the array `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The goal is to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `length` and the string `expression`.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with `expression` and `length` as arguments.
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of `+` characters in the string and calculates the number of `-` characters as `length - count`.
   - It returns the absolute difference between the count of `+` and `-` characters.

3. **Evaluating the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the difference between the number of `+` and `-` characters.
   - This difference is not the same as the minimum possible penalty as defined in the problem.
   - The minimum possible penalty is achieved by splitting the array into subarrays such that the sum of each subarray is as close to zero as possible.
   - For example, in the case of `s = "+-+-+-"`, the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0`.
   - The given program does not attempt to split the array into subarrays; it simply calculates the difference in counts of `+` and `-` characters.

4. **Challenging the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array.
   - The program's approach of calculating the absolute difference between the counts of `+` and `-` characters is not sufficient to solve the problem as stated.
   - The program fails to consider the actual splitting of the array and the calculation of penalties for each subarray.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program is indeed incorrect because it does not follow the required steps to find the minimum possible penalty.
   - The program's logic is flawed and does not match the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
