Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 32) from standard input, and for each test case, it reads a string `a` of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it counts the number of 'A' characters and the number of 'B' characters. If the number of 'A' characters is greater than the number of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to standard output. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed. **
