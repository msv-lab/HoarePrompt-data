Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The program provided is not correct for the given problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Support Costs**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum cost of installing supports for a single row. However, the implementation is flawed.
   - The first loop `for i in range(0, d - 1): row[i] = row[i] + 1` only increments the first `d-1` elements, which is not necessary and incorrect. The cost of installing a support in any cell should be `a_{i,j} + 1`.
   - The second loop `for i in range(d - 1, len(row)): row[i] = (min(row[max(0, i - (d + 1)):i]) if i > 0 else 0) + row[i] + 1` is also incorrect. It should not be updating the row in place but rather calculating the minimum cost dynamically.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The correct approach to solve this problem involves dynamic programming to ensure that the cost of installing supports is minimized while adhering to the distance constraint `d`.
   - The function `func_1` should use a dynamic programming array to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell in the row, considering the distance constraint.

3. **Summing Costs for Multiple Bridges**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly sums the costs for `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost. However, it relies on the incorrect `func_1` function, which means the costs calculated for each row are incorrect.

### Corrected Approach:
Here is a corrected version of the program using dynamic programming to calculate the minimum cost for each row and then summing the costs for `k` consecutive rows:

```python
from typing import List

def min_support_cost(row: List[int], d: int) -> int:
    n = len(row)
    dp = [0] * n
    
    # Initialize the first support cost
    dp[0] = row[0] + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum cost for each cell
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[j] = min(dp[max(0, j - d):j]) + row[j] + 1
    
    return dp[-1]

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k, d = map(int, input().split())
        rows = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Calculate the minimum cost for each row
        costs = [min_support_cost(row, d) for row in rows]
        
        # Calculate the minimum total cost for k consecutive rows
        total_costs = [sum(costs[i:i + k]) for i in range(n - k + 1)]
        
        print(min(total_costs))

# Call the function to solve the problem
func_2()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **`min_support_cost` Function**:
  - This function calculates the minimum cost to install supports in a single row using dynamic programming.
  - `dp[j]` stores the minimum cost to install a support at cell `j`.
  - The initial cost for the first cell is `row[0] + 1`.
  - For each subsequent cell `j`, the cost is the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus the cost of the current cell `row[j] + 1`.

- **`func_2` Function**:
  - This function reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It calculates the minimum cost for each row using the `min_support_cost` function.
  - It then calculates the total cost for `k` consecutive rows and prints the minimum total cost.

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum cost of installing supports while adhering to the given constraints.
