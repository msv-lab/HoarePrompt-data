Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and k is even, `n` is the first integer input, `k` is the second integer input, `permutation` is a list of `n` zeros, `idx` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is initialized to 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and `permutation` is still a list of `n` zeros.
