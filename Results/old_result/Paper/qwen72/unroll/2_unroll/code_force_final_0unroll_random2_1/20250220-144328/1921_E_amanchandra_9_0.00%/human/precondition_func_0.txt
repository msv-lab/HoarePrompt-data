The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each consisting of six integers: `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`. The inputs are such that `1 <= h <= 10^6`, `1 <= w <= 10^9`, `1 <= x_a, x_b <= h`, `1 <= y_a, y_b <= w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips do not coincide (`x_a != x_b` or `y_a != y_b`). Additionally, the sum of `h` over all test cases does not exceed `10^6`.
