### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which represent the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively.
   - It initializes `sum_f` to 0, which will store the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends.

2. **Summing Initial Friendship Values:**
   - The program reads `m` lines, each containing three integers `a`, `b`, and `f` representing a pair of friends and their initial friendship value.
   - It adds each `f` to `sum_f`.

3. **Calculating Combinations:**
   - The program calculates `cn2` which is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n` (i.e., \(\binom{n}{2}\)).
   - This is done using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the numerator `p` and the denominator `q` for the expected value.
   - The numerator `p` is calculated as `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f + m * k * (k - 1)`.
     - `2 * k * cn2 * sum_f` accounts for the initial friendship values being chosen `k` times.
     - `m * k * (k - 1)` accounts for the increase in friendship values for each pair of friends over the `k` excursions.
   - The denominator `q` is calculated as `2 * cn2 ** 2`.

5. **Simplifying the Fraction:**
   - The program uses the `math.gcd` function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `p` and `q`.
   - It simplifies the fraction by dividing both `p` and `q` by their GCD.

6. **Modular Inverse and Final Output:**
   - The program calculates the modular inverse of `q` using `pow(q, -1, M)`.
   - It then computes the final result as `p * pow(q, -1, M) % M` and prints it.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Formula:**
  - The formula used to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values is correct.
  - The expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair chosen is the sum of the initial friendship values multiplied by the probability of choosing a pair of friends, plus the expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions.
  - The probability of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
  - The expected increase in friendship values over `k` excursions is \(\frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}} = \frac{m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{n(n-1)}\).
  - Combining these, the expected value is \(\frac{2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2}\).

- **Modular Arithmetic:**
  - The program correctly uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure the result fits within the constraints.
  - The use of `pow(q, -1, M)` to compute the modular inverse is appropriate.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where there are no pairs of friends (i.e., `m = 0`) correctly, as the expected value is 0 in this case.
  - The program also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends correctly, as the expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the increase over `k` excursions.

### Verification of the Formula:

Let's break down the formula step by step:

- **Initial Contribution:**
  - The initial contribution to the expected value is the sum of the initial friendship values of all pairs of friends, each chosen `k` times.
  - This is given by \( k \cdot \sum f_i \).

- **Increase Contribution:**
  - The increase in friendship value for each pair of friends over `k` excursions is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is \(\frac{k(k-1)}{2}\).
  - Since there are `m` pairs of friends, the total increase contribution is \( m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \).

- **Combining Contributions:**
  - The total expected value is the sum of the initial contribution and the increase contribution.
  - This is given by \( k \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \).

- **Probability Factor:**
  - The probability of choosing a pair of friends is \(\frac{m}{\binom{n}{2}} = \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}\).
  - Therefore, the expected value is scaled by this probability:
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = \left( k \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \right) \cdot \frac{2m}{n(n-1)}
    \]

- **Simplifying the Formula:**
  - The numerator `p` is:
    \[
    p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \binom{n}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)
    \]
  - The denominator `q` is:
    \[
    q = 2 \cdot \binom{n}{2}^2
    \]

- **Simplifying Further:**
  - Since \(\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), we can substitute:
    \[
    p = 2 \cdot k \cdot \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1) = k \cdot n(n-1) \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)
    \]
  - And:
    \[
    q = 2 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{2}
    \]

- **Final Simplification:**
  - The simplified expected value is:
    \[
    \text{Expected Value} = \frac{k \cdot n(n-1) \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1)}{\frac{n^2(n-1)^2}{2}} = \frac{2 \cdot (k \cdot n(n-1) \cdot \sum f_i + m \cdot k \cdot (k-1))}{n^2(n-1)^2}
    \]

- **Modular Inverse:**
  - The program correctly computes the modular inverse of `q` and uses it to find the final result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The original assessment is accurate.
