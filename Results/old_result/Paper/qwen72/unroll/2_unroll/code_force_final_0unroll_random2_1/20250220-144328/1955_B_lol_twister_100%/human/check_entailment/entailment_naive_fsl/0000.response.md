Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the elements in the array `b` are not unique. According to the problem description, the elements of the progressive square should be unique, but the program does not check for this. If there are duplicate elements in the array `b`, the program will still consider it as a valid progressive square, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8 8
```
The array `b` contains a duplicate element `8`. The program will still sort the list and compare it to the generated list of elements, which will result in an incorrect "yes" output, even though the elements are not unique and thus cannot form a valid progressive square.
