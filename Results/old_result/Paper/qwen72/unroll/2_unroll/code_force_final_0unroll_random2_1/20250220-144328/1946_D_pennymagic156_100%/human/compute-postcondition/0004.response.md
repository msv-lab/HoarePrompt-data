To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the loop step by step, considering the initial state and the operations performed within the loop.

### Initial State:
- `n` and `x` are the values returned by `func_3()`.
- `a` is a list of integers returned by `func_1()`.
- `t` is an empty list.
- `ans` is -1.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates from `i = 29` down to `i = 0` (30 iterations in total). For each iteration, the following steps are performed:

1. **Bit Extraction:**
   - `u` is the `i`-th bit of `x`.
   - `v` is the sum of the `i`-th bits of all elements in `a`.

2. **Condition 1: `u == v == 0`**
   - If both `u` and `v` are 0, the loop continues to the next iteration.

3. **Condition 2: `u == 0` and `v % 2 == 1`**
   - If `u` is 0 and `v` is odd, the loop returns `ans` (which is -1 in the initial state).

4. **Condition 3: `u == 0` and `v % 2 == 0`**
   - If `u` is 0 and `v` is even, the loop performs a series of operations:
     - `op` is initialized to 0.
     - `ai` is initialized to 0.
     - For each `val` in `a`, the `i`-th bit is XORed with `op`.
     - If `op` is 0, `ai` is added to `t` and reset to 0.
     - After processing all elements in `a`, `a` is set to `t`, and `t` is reset to an empty list.

5. **Condition 4: `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 1`**
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is odd, the loop continues to the next iteration.

6. **Condition 5: `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0`**
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is even, the loop performs a series of operations:
     - `op` is initialized to 0.
     - `cnt` is initialized to 0.
     - For each `val` in `a`, the `i`-th bit is XORed with `op`.
     - If `op` is 0, `cnt` is incremented.
     - After processing all elements in `a`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `cnt`.

7. **Condition 6: `u == 1` and `v == 0`**
   - If `u` is 1 and `v` is 0, the loop breaks.

### Final Output State:
- **`n` and `x`**: These values are not modified within the loop, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
- **`a`**: The list `a` may be modified within the loop, but the exact final state depends on the initial values of `a` and `x`.
- **`t`**: The list `t` is reset to an empty list at the end of each iteration where it is used, so it will be an empty list at the end of the loop.
- **`ans`**: The value of `ans` is updated based on the conditions within the loop. If `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0`, `ans` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `cnt`.

Given the complexity of the loop and the dependency on the initial values of `a` and `x`, the exact final state of `a` and `ans` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a` and `x`. However, we can describe the general state:

- `n` and `x` remain unchanged.
- `a` may be modified but will be a list of integers.
- `t` will be an empty list.
- `ans` will be the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the iterations where `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0`.

### Output State:
Output State: **`n` and `x` are unchanged, `a` is a modified list of integers, `t` is an empty list, `ans` is the maximum value of `cnt` encountered during the iterations where `u == 1` and `v % 2 == 0`.**
