Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` with specific constraints. It then reads `n` lines, each containing `m` integers representing the depths of river cells. The function calculates the cost for each row using the `func_1` function and stores these costs in a list. It computes the sum of `k` consecutive elements from this list for each possible segment and prints the minimum of these sums. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, `rows`, and `costs` remain unchanged, and the minimum sum of `k` consecutive costs is printed to the standard output. **
