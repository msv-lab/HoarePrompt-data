The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `path`. `path` is a non-empty list of strings where each string is either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity. The length of `path` is at least 2. The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- **Case_1**: The function returns `0`.
- **Case_2**: The function returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `path`, which is a non-empty list of strings with each string being either '@', '*', or a representation of a sign's periodicity, and the length of `path` is at least 2. It returns `0` in one case, and in another case, it returns the maximum value among the elements in the `dp` list that are greater than negative infinity.**
