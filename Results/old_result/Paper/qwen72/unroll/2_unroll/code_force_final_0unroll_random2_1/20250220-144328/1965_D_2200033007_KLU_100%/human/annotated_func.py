#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `a` of positive integers and returns a sorted list `cts` containing the cumulative sums of all subarrays of `a` starting from each index to the end of the list. The original list `a` remains unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` of integers, where each integer represents the sum of all but one of the subarrays of a hidden palindrome array. It processes this list to return a new list `odds` containing unique integers. These integers are the sums of subarrays from the hidden palindrome array that do not have a matching sum in the list `cts`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `odds` contains only those unique sums that do not have a duplicate in `cts`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts a list `odds` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `a` of size `n` where the elements from the middle to the start of the list and their corresponding mirrored positions from the end of the list are set to half the difference between consecutive elements in `odds`.
