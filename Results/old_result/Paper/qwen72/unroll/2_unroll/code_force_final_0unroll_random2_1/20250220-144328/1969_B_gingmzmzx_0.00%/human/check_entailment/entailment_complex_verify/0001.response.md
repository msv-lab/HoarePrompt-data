### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates `n` times to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and converts it into a list of integers (0s and 1s).

2. **Counting Zeroes:**
   - The program correctly calculates the total number of zeroes in the string `s` and stores it in the variable `zeroes`.

3. **Tracking Counts and Cost:**
   - The program initializes a list `cnt` to keep track of the counts of 0s and 1s encountered so far.
   - It also initializes a variable `ans` to store the total cost of operations.

4. **Iterating Through the String:**
   - The program iterates through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - For each character:
     - It increments the count of the current character in `cnt`.
     - If the character is `0` and there are any `1`s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed to move the `0` to the correct position.
     - If the character is `1`, it adds the number of remaining zeroes that need to be moved to the left of the current `1` to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing the string, the program prints the total cost `ans` for the current test case.

### Verification Using Annotated Code:
- **State Before Function Call:**
  - The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a binary string `s`.
  - The input is read and processed within the function itself.

- **State During Loop:**
  - For each test case, the string `s` is converted to a list of integers.
  - The variable `zeroes` is correctly set to the count of 0s in `s`.
  - The list `cnt` is initialized to `[0, 0]` to track the counts of 0s and 1s.
  - The variable `ans` is initialized to 0 to store the total cost.

- **State During String Iteration:**
  - The program correctly updates `cnt` for each character in `s`.
  - For each `0` encountered, if there are any `1`s before it (i.e., `cnt[1] > 0`), it adds 1 to `ans` because a cyclic shift is needed.
  - For each `1` encountered, it adds the number of remaining zeroes that need to be moved to the left of the current `1` to `ans`.

- **State After Loop:**
  - The total cost `ans` is printed for the current test case.
  - The variables `s`, `zeroes`, `cnt`, and `ans` are reset for the next iteration.

### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10`
  - Output: `2`
  - Reason: The string `10` can be sorted by performing a cyclic shift on the entire string, which costs 2. The program correctly calculates this.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `0000`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: The string `0000` is already sorted, so no operations are needed. The program correctly calculates this.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `11000`
  - Output: `9`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves three operations, each costing 3. The program correctly calculates this.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `101011`
  - Output: `5`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 5. The program correctly calculates this.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `01101001`
  - Output: `11`
  - Reason: The optimal strategy involves operations that cost a total of 11. The program correctly calculates this.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic and implementation are correct. It accurately calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string using cyclic shifts for each test case. The annotated code confirms that the program follows the expected behavior and handles all test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
