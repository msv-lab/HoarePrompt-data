Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed when the `print` statement is executed.

### Initial State and Conditions:
1. `r` is a list of integers.
2. `n` is `r[0]`.
3. `m` is `r[1]`.
4. `x1` is `r[2] + a`.
5. `y1` is `r[3] - a` if `y2 <= y1` else `r[3] + a`.
6. `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
7. `y2` is 1 if `y2 <= y1` else `r[1]`.
8. `a` is `r[5] - 1` if `y1 >= y2` else `r[1] - r[5]`.
9. `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
10. `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
11. `x2` is greater than `x1`.
12. `x1` is greater than or equal to 1.
13. `x2` is less than or equal to `n`.
14. If `y2 <= y1`, `x2` is equal to `x1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number, and `c` is `y1 - 1`.
15. If `y2 > y1`, the difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number, and `c` is `m - y1`.
16. The current value of `b // 2` is greater than `a`.
17. The absolute value of `x2 - c` is greater than or equal to `x1 + c`.
18. `y1` is between 1 and `m` inclusive.
19. `x1` is between 1 and `n` inclusive.

### Analysis:
- The `print('Alice')` statement is a simple print statement that prints the string 'Alice'.
- The conditions and variables described in the initial state do not affect the output of the `print` statement because the statement is not dependent on any of these variables or conditions. It simply prints the string 'Alice'.

### Conclusion:
The `print` statement will print the string 'Alice' regardless of the values of the variables or the conditions described in the initial state.

Output: **Alice**
