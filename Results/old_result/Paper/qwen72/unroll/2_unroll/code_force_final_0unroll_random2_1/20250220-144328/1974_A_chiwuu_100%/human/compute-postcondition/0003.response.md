The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function is designed to handle test cases where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `x` and `y` are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function's output is not specified in the given information, but it is expected to process these inputs and return a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case includes two integers `x` and `y` such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the provided information.**
