### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` which represent the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.

2. **Logic for Maximum Profit**:
   - The function calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`. This ensures that `k` is the maximum number of buns that can be sold at the modified price without exceeding the total number of buns or the price difference between `b` and `a`.
   - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it means selling buns at the modified price would not yield more profit than selling them at the usual price. Therefore, the function prints `a * n`, which is the profit from selling all buns at the usual price.
   - If `b` is greater than `a`, the function calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price. The profit from the first `k` buns is given by the sum of an arithmetic series: `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`. The profit from the remaining buns is `(n - k) * a`.

3. **Arithmetic Series Calculation**:
   - The formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the common difference is `-1`. This is because the price of the i-th bun in the promotion is `b - i + 1`, and the sum of the first `k` terms of this series is `b + (b-1) + (b-2) + ... + (b-k+1)`, which simplifies to `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases correctly:
     - When `b <= a`, it sells all buns at the usual price.
     - When `b > a`, it calculates the optimal `k` and the corresponding profit.
     - The function also handles large values of `n`, `a`, and `b` up to \(10^9\), which is within the problem's constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the correct profit for each test case, as verified by the example inputs and outputs provided in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets all the requirements of the problem description.
