You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to group the given integers such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits in any of the 31 least significant bits.
   - The goal is to minimize the number of groups.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - For any two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) to be in the same group, \( x \) and \( y \) must have different bits in all positions from 1 to 31.
   - This means that for any two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) in the same group, \( x \oplus y \) (bitwise XOR) must be all 1s in the 31 least significant bits. In other words, \( x \oplus y = 2^{31} - 1 \).

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `check` to \( 2^{31} - 1 \), which is the number with all 31 least significant bits set to 1.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \( n \) and the list of integers `data`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `dic` to keep track of the occurrences of each number and its XOR with `check`.
   - It also initializes `ans` to \( n \), which is the maximum number of groups needed if no numbers can be paired.

4. **Loop Through Data:**
   - For each integer \( i \) in `data`:
     - It computes \( s = i \oplus \text{check} \).
     - If \( s \) is already in the dictionary `dic`:
       - It decrements the count of \( s \) in `dic` and reduces `ans` by 1.
       - If the count of \( s \) becomes 0, it deletes \( s \) from `dic`.
     - If \( i \) is already in the dictionary `dic`:
       - It increments the count of \( i \) in `dic`.
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \) to `dic` with a count of 1.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

5. **Issues in the Program:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the condition where two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) can be in the same group if \( x \oplus y = 2^{31} - 1 \).
   - The program only checks if the XOR of a number with `check` is already in the dictionary, which is not sufficient to ensure that all pairs in the same group have different bits in all 31 positions.
   - The program does not correctly count the number of groups needed. It incorrectly reduces `ans` by 1 for each number that has a matching XOR, which can lead to incorrect results.

6. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach would be to use a set to keep track of the unique bit patterns of the numbers.
   - For each number, check if its bit pattern or the bit pattern of its XOR with `check` is already in the set.
   - If neither is in the set, add the number's bit pattern to the set.
   - The size of the set at the end of processing all numbers will be the minimum number of groups needed.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to group the numbers based on the given condition. It fails to ensure that all pairs in the same group have different bits in all 31 positions, and it incorrectly reduces the number of groups needed.
