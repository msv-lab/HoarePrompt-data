### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each screen has a grid of size 5x3, which means it has 15 cells.
   - There are two types of icons: 1x1 (occupies 1 cell) and 2x2 (occupies 4 cells).
   - The goal is to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `ap`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of 1x1 icons `x` and 2x2 icons `y`.
   - The program then handles different cases based on the values of `x` and `y`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - The program calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is because each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.
     - It then attempts to subtract the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total number of cells available on the screens calculated for 2x2 icons. However, the calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)` to correctly account for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
     - The remaining cells are used to place the 1x1 icons. If there are not enough cells left, additional screens are calculated using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
     - The program directly calculates the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is correct.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
     - The program directly calculates the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is correct.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
     - The program prints 0, which is correct as no icons need to be placed.

4. **Verification of Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can fit 2 of the 2x2 icons, so `math.ceil(y / 2)` is the correct calculation.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens required for 1x1 icons is also correct. Each screen has 15 cells, so `math.ceil(x / 15)` is the correct calculation.
   - The program correctly handles the case where both `x` and `y` are 0 by printing 0.
   - The program correctly handles the case where only one type of icon is present by directly calculating the required screens for that type.
   - However, the calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)` to correctly account for the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.

### Corrected Program:
```python
import math

def func_1():
    ap = int(input())
    for k in range(ap):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        if x > 0 and y > 0:
            bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
            x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)
            bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)
            print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        elif x == 0 and y > 0:
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
        elif x > 0 and y == 0:
            print(math.ceil(x / 15))
        else:
            print(0)

func_1()
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate in identifying the logical error in the calculation of the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons. The corrected program should use `x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)` to correctly account for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
