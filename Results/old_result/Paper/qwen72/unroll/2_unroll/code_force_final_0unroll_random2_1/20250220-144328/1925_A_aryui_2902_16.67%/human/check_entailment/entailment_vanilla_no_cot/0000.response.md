Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` generates a string `s` by repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the generated string `s`.

For example, for the input `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the program generates the string `aabb`, but the string `ba` is not a subsequence of `aabb`.

A correct approach would be to generate a string that ensures all possible combinations of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets are subsequences. One such approach is to use a De Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence in which every possible subsequence of a given length appears as a substring. However, for this problem, a simpler approach can be used to ensure all combinations are subsequences.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = ''.join([chr(97 + j % k) for j in range(n * k)])
    print(s)
```

This program generates a string of length `n * k` where each character is one of the first `k` alphabets, ensuring that all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of the generated string. For example, for `n = 2` and `k = 2`, it generates `abab`, which contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using `a` and `b`.
