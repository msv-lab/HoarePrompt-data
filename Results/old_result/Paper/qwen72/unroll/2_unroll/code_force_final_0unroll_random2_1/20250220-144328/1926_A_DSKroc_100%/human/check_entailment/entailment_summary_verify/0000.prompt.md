You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        ac = 0
        bc = 0
        s = input()
        for i in s:
            if i == 'A':
                ac += 1
            else:
                bc += 1
        if ac > bc:
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. If the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case to standard output. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the state of the program is as it was before the function call, except for the printed results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases, processes each string of length 5, counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B', and prints the letter that appears most frequently. The logic is straightforward and handles all edge cases, including strings with equal counts of 'A' and 'B' (though the problem guarantees all strings are distinct, so this case is not applicable). The program works correctly for all provided examples and any other potential input within the constraints.
