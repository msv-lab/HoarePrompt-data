Functionality: ** The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` positive integers `a`. For each test case, the function computes and prints the maximum value among the minimum pairs of consecutive elements in the list `a`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly to the standard output. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` in an undefined state. **
