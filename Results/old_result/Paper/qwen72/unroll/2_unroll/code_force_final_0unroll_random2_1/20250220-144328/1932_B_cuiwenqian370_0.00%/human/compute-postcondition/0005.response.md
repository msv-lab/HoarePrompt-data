The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input read from `sys.stdin`, `t` is the integer value of the first element in `data` and must be greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
