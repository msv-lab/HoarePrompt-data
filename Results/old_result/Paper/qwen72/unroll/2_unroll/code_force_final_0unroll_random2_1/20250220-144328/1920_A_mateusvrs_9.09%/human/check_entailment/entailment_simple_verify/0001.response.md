### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - This part is correctly handled and matches the problem description.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `cx` is a set to store the values of `k` that must be excluded (type 3 constraints).
   - `ax` is initialized to a very large number (1000000000 + 7) to represent the minimum upper bound (type 2 constraints).
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to represent the maximum lower bound (type 1 constraints).
   - The initialization values are appropriate and ensure that the initial bounds are set to extreme values that will be updated correctly as constraints are processed.

3. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, the function reads the type `a` and the value `x`.
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum of the current `bx` and `x`. This ensures that `bx` is the highest lower bound.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum of the current `ax` and `x`. This ensures that `ax` is the lowest upper bound.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), it adds `x` to the set `cx`. This correctly collects all values that `k` must not be equal to.

4. **Checking Valid Range**:
   - If `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`, it means there is no valid range for `k`, and the function appends 0 to the result list `r`.
   - This check is correct and ensures that the function handles the case where the constraints are contradictory.

5. **Counting Excluded Values**:
   - If there is a valid range (`bx < ax`), the function initializes a temporary variable `tmp` to 0.
   - It iterates through the set `cx` and counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
   - The number of valid integers `k` is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`.
   - This calculation is correct and ensures that the function subtracts the number of excluded values from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each test case, separated by newlines.
   - This matches the required output format.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Type 1 and Type 2 Constraints**:
  - The function correctly identifies the maximum lower bound (`bx`) and the minimum upper bound (`ax`).
  - This ensures that the range `[bx, ax]` is the valid range for `k`.

- **Type 3 Constraints**:
  - The function correctly excludes the values that must not be equal to `k` by adding them to the set `cx`.
  - It then counts how many of these excluded values fall within the valid range.
  - The use of a set for `cx` ensures that the exclusion values are unique and that the operations (addition and membership check) are efficient.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `bx >= ax`, the function correctly returns 0, indicating no valid integers.
  - The function correctly handles the case where there are multiple constraints of type 3 that fall within the valid range.
  - The function also handles the case where there are no constraints of type 3, resulting in `tmp` being 0 and the valid range being `ax - bx + 1`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The use of a set for `cx` ensures that the exclusion values are unique and that the operations (addition and membership check) are efficient.
  - The overall time complexity is O(n) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.
