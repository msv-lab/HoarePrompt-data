The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def min_operations_to_increase_median(n, a):` where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function will be called multiple times for different test cases, with the total number of test cases `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
