### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `tt`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, calling the function `func_1()` for each one.

2. **Function `func_1()`:**
   - The function reads the input for each test case, which includes the dimensions of the board `n` and `m`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.
   - It checks if Bob's chip is already in or below Alice's row (`x2 <= x1`). If so, the game is a draw because Bob cannot move up to Alice's row.
   - If Bob's chip is above Alice's row (`x2 > x1`), it checks if the difference in rows is odd or even.

3. **Odd Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is odd (`(x2 - x1) % 2 != 0`), Alice has the first move and can potentially win if she can move her chip to Bob's position.
   - The program checks if Alice's chip is directly below Bob's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Alice wins.
   - If not, it simulates Alice's and Bob's moves to see if Alice can force a win by moving diagonally to Bob's position.
   - If Alice cannot force a win, it checks if Bob can force a draw by moving to a position where Alice cannot win.
   - If neither can force a win, the game is a draw.

4. **Even Difference in Rows:**
   - If the difference in rows is even (`(x2 - x1) % 2 == 0`), Bob has the first move and can potentially win if he can move his chip to Alice's position.
   - The program checks if Bob's chip is directly above Alice's chip (`y1 == y2`). If so, Bob wins.
   - If not, it simulates Bob's and Alice's moves to see if Bob can force a win by moving diagonally to Alice's position.
   - If Bob cannot force a win, it checks if Alice can force a draw by moving to a position where Bob cannot win.
   - If neither can force a win, the game is a draw.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases where Alice or Bob cannot make a move (e.g., Alice in the last row or Bob in the first row).
   - It also ensures that the new positions of the chips do not go beyond the board boundaries.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Alice", "Bob", or "Draw" based on the outcome of the game for each test case.

### Correctness:
The program appears to handle all the given conditions and edge cases correctly. It follows the logic of the game and the rules provided in the problem description. The simulation of moves and the checks for winning conditions are implemented appropriately.

**Correctness: **True****

However, it's always a good idea to test the program with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected in all scenarios. If you have any specific test cases or concerns, feel free to share them for further verification.
