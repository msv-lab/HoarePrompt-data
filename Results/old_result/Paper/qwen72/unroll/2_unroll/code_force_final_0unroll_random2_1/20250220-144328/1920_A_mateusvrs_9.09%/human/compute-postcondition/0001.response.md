Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each of the n constraints is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case. `r` is an empty list.**
