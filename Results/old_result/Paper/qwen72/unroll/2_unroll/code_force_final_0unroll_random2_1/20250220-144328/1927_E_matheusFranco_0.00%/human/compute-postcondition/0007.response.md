Output State: **`n` and `k` remain the same, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the first `k` indices are filled with the values from `1` to `k` in a pattern that repeats every `k` elements, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k + 1`, `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code snippet creates a string `result` by joining the string representations of the elements in the list `permutation` with spaces. The values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` are not changed by this code. The new variable `result` is a string that contains the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces.
