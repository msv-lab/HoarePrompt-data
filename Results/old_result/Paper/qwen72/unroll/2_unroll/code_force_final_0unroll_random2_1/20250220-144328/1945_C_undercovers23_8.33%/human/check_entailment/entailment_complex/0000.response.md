### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of houses `n` and the string `s` representing the preferences of the residents.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function calculates `pk` as `n // 2`, which is the middle position of the village. This is correct for both even and odd `n`.

3. **Counting Preferences:**
   - The function converts the string `s` to a list `sl` and counts the total number of '1's (`o`) and '0's (`z`).

4. **Iterating Over Possible Positions:**
   - The function iterates over possible positions for the road (from 0 to `n-1`), updating the counts of '0's and '1's on the left and right sides of the road.
   - It calculates the percentage of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side using `math.ceil` to ensure the conditions are met (at least 50%).

5. **Checking Conditions:**
   - If the conditions are met (at least 50% of residents on each side are satisfied), the position `i + 1` is added to the list `lst`.

6. **Finding the Optimal Position:**
   - The function finds the position in `lst` that is closest to `pk` (the middle of the village) and stores it in `mini`.
   - It then collects all positions in `lst` that are equally close to `pk` and sorts them to find the smallest one.

7. **Handling No Valid Positions:**
   - If no valid positions are found in `lst`, the function checks the overall preference:
     - If more than 50% of residents prefer the right side (`c1 >= 50`), it outputs 0 (road before the first house).
     - Otherwise, it outputs `n` (road after the last house).

8. **Output:**
   - The function prints the optimal position for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Condition Checking:**
  - The condition checking for at least 50% of residents on each side being satisfied is correct. The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the conditions are met for both even and odd numbers of houses.

- **Optimal Position Selection:**
  - The function correctly finds the position that is closest to the middle of the village and handles ties by selecting the smaller position.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where no valid positions are found by checking the overall preference and outputting the appropriate position (0 or `n`).

- **Efficiency:**
  - The function processes each test case in linear time with respect to `n`, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal position for the road based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
