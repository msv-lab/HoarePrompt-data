Output State: **The function should take three parameters: a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of integers `n` where each `n[i]` is the width of the grid for the i-th test case (2 ≤ `n[i]` ≤ 2 × 10^5), and two lists of binary strings `a1` and `a2` where `a1[i]` and `a2[i]` represent the two rows of the grid for the i-th test case. Each binary string in `a1` and `a2` consists of characters '0' or '1' and has a length equal to `n[i]`. The sum of all `n[i]` values does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `a` is an empty list.**
