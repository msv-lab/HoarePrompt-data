The function `min_groups` (incorrectly named `func` in the provided code) accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. It processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The function then calculates and prints the minimum number of unique integers remaining in the list `a` after processing each integer. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the processed test cases, with the final number of unique integers printed for each test case.
