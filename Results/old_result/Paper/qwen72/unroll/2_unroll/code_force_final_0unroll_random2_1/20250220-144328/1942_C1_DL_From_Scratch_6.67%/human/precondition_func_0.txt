The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangles(n, x, chosen_vertices):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Additionally, `n` must satisfy 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` must satisfy 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
