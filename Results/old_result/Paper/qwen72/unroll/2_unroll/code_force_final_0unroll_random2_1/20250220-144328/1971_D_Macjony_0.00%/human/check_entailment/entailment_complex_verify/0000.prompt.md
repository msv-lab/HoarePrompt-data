You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take a binary string `s` as input, where `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1', and its length is between 1 and 500 inclusive. The function should be called within a loop that processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
                    j += 1
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read a binary string `s` from the input, process it to count the number of transitions between '0' and '1' (excluding the transition from '0' to '1' if it occurs), and print the count. The variables `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` will be reset for each iteration, so their final values after the loop will be the values from the last iteration. Specifically, `i` will be `t-1`, `s` will be the last input binary string, `count` will be the count of transitions for the last input string, `flag` will be `True` if the last input string contained a transition from '0' to '1', and `j` will be the length of the last input string minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` and processes it to count the number of transitions between '0' and '1', excluding the transition from '0' to '1' if it occurs. The function prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the final state of the program includes the variables `i`, `s`, `count`, `flag`, and `j` holding the values from the last test case. Specifically, `i` will be `t-1`, `s` will be the last input binary string, `count` will be the count of transitions for the last input string, `flag` will be `True` if the last input string contained a transition from '0' to '1', and `j` will be the length of the last input string minus 1. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the binary string is already sorted and contains only '0's or only '1's correctly. Specifically, the program increments the `count` whenever it encounters a change in the characters, but it does not account for the fact that if the string is already sorted, it should return `1` regardless of the length of the string.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
00000000
```
The program will output `1`, which is correct. However, for the input:
```
1
11111111
```
The program will also output `1`, which is correct. But for the input:
```
1
00000001
```
The program will output `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because the string is already sorted and does not require any cuts.

To fix this, the program should check if the string is already sorted and return `1` in such cases.
