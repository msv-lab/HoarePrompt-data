To determine the output state after the loop executes all the iterations, let's break down the loop and understand what it does:

1. **Loop 1:** `for i in range(cases):`
   - This loop iterates over the range from 0 to `cases - 1`.

2. **Loop 2:** `for j in range(3):`
   - This inner loop iterates over the range from 0 to 2, which means it will run 3 times for each `i`.

3. **Inner Loop Body:**
   - `temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)`
     - This line converts the integer at `info[i][j]` to a character by adding 96 to it and then converting it to a character using `chr`.
     - For example, if `info[i][j]` is 1, `chr(1 + 96)` is `chr(97)`, which is 'a'.
     - If `info[i][j]` is 2, `chr(2 + 96)` is `chr(98)`, which is 'b'.
     - This process is repeated for each of the three integers in the sublist `info[i]`.

4. **After Inner Loop:**
   - `print(temp)`
     - This prints the string `temp` which is constructed by concatenating the characters derived from the integers in `info[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- The `info` list contains `cases` sublists, each with three integers representing the positions of the letters after decoding.
- Each sublist is sorted in ascending order.

Let's assume an example initial state for clarity:
- `info = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
- `cases = 3`

The loop will execute as follows:
- For `i = 0`:
  - `temp = '' + chr(1 + 96) + chr(2 + 96) + chr(3 + 96) = 'a' + 'b' + 'c' = 'abc'`
  - `print('abc')`
- For `i = 1`:
  - `temp = '' + chr(4 + 96) + chr(5 + 96) + chr(6 + 96) = 'd' + 'e' + 'f' = 'def'`
  - `print('def')`
- For `i = 2`:
  - `temp = '' + chr(7 + 96) + chr(8 + 96) + chr(9 + 96) = 'g' + 'h' + 'i' = 'ghi'`
  - `print('ghi')`

The output of the loop will be:
```
abc
def
ghi
```

Since the loop does not modify any variables outside of its scope, the state of `info` and `cases` remains unchanged.

Output State: **The `info` list remains the same, containing `cases` sublists, each with three integers representing the positions of the letters after decoding. Each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The `cases` variable also remains unchanged. The loop prints the decoded strings for each sublist.**
