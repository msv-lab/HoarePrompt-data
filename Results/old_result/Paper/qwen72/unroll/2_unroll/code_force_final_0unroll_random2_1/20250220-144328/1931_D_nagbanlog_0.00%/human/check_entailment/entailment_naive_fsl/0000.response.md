Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition where \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The current logic only checks if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i \mod y\) matches the required modulo value for \(a_j\). However, it does not ensure that \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

For example, consider the test case:
- \(n = 4\), \(x = 3\), \(y = 2\)
- \(a = [1, 2, 4, 5]\)

The program will incorrectly count the pair \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\) as beautiful because:
- \(1 + 5 = 6\) is divisible by \(3\)
- \(1 \mod 2 = 1\) and \(5 \mod 2 = 1\), so the required modulo condition is met.

However, \(1 - 5 = -4\) is not divisible by \(2\). Therefore, the pair \(\langle 1, 4 \rangle\) should not be counted as beautiful, but the program does count it. This makes the program incorrect.
