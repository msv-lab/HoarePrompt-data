### Reasoning:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the prefix sum array `p` from the input array `l`. This is done using the loop:
     ```python
     c = 0
     for x in l:
         c += x
         p.append(c)
     ```
   - The prefix sum array `p` is used to efficiently compute the sum of any subarray `c[a:b]` in constant time.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program calculates the sum of the subarray `c[a:b]` using the prefix sum array `p`:
     ```python
     s = p[b - 1]
     if a - 2 >= 0:
         s -= p[a - 2]
     ```
   - The condition `if a - 2 >= 0` is used to handle the case where `a` is 1, ensuring that the prefix sum subtraction does not go out of bounds.

3. **Good Subarray Condition**:
   - The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying two conditions:
     - The length of the subarray `b - a + 1` is greater than 1.
     - The sum of the subarray `s` is at least twice the length of the subarray.
   - These conditions are derived from the problem statement:
     - The subarray must have at least two elements to ensure there exists a different array `b` where `a_i ≠ b_i` for all `i`.
     - The sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray to ensure that it is possible to construct a different array `b` where each `b_i > 0` and `a_i ≠ b_i`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray meets the conditions, and 'NO' otherwise. This is consistent with the problem statement's requirements.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The prefix sum array is used efficiently, and the conditions are checked accurately for each query.

**Correctness: True**
