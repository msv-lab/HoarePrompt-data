Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and the function should take two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `stones` where each sublist represents the piles of stones for a test case. Each sublist contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where `1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5`. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2·10^5`.**
