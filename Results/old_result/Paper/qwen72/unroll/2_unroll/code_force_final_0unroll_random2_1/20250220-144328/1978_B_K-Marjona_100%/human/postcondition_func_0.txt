The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from input. It calculates and prints a result for each test case based on the following logic: if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `a * n`; otherwise, it prints `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`, where `k = min(n, b - a)`. After processing all test cases, the function completes, and the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
