The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `primary_items`, a list of tuples (a_i, b_i), and `secondary_heap`, a list of tuples (b_i - a_i). It calculates the sum of the first elements of all tuples in `secondary_heap` and adds to this sum the values of `a_i + b_i` for all tuples in `primary_items` where `a_i + b_i` is greater than or equal to 0. The function returns the final value of this sum. The `primary_items` and `secondary_heap` lists remain unchanged after the function execution.
