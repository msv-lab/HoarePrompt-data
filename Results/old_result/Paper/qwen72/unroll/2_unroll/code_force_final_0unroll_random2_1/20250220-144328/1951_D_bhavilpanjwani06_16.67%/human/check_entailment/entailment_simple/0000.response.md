### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, which represent the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - **Case 1: `n < k`**
     - If Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.
   - **Case 2: `n == k`**
     - If Alice has exactly the same number of coins as the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, Bob can set up one stall with the price of `n` coins per jewel. Alice will buy exactly one jewel from this stall, and the program correctly prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (1) and the price per jewel (n).
   - **Case 3: `n > k`**
     - If Alice has more coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, the program checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`.
     - **Sub-case 3a: `k - 1 < n - k + 1`**
       - If this condition is true, Bob can set up two stalls: one with the price `n - k + 1` and another with the price `1`. Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. The program correctly prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls (2) and the prices `n - k + 1` and `1`.
     - **Sub-case 3b: `k - 1 >= n - k + 1`**
       - If this condition is false, it means that Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels with the given constraints. The program correctly prints "NO" in this case.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program follows the required output format for each test case:
     - "YES" or "NO" on the first line.
     - If "YES", the number of stalls on the second line and the prices of the stalls on the third line.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is equal to `k` and where `n` is greater than `k` but the condition `k - 1 < n - k + 1` is not met.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given conditions and produces the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
