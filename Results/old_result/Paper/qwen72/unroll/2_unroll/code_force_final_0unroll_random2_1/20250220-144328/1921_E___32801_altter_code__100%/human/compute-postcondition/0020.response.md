Output State: **The program returns nothing.** 

The given precondition states that `y1` is not equal to `y2`, but the initial state indicates that `y1` is equal to `y2`. Due to this contradiction, the program does not enter the if condition, and as a result, the `return` statement is executed without returning any specific value. Therefore, the program returns nothing.
