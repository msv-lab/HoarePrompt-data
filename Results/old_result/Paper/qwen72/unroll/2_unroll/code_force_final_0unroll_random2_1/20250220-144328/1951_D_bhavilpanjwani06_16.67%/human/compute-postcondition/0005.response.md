Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18.
- The function is handling multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000.
- `n` and `k` are now assigned the values from the input, which are integers, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- Additionally, the current values of `n` and `k` are equal.

Given this information, the `print` statement in the code snippet will execute with the condition that `n` and `k` are equal. The statement itself does not depend on any specific values of `n` or `k`, but rather on the fact that they are equal.

The code snippet is:
```
print('YES')
```

Since the precondition states that `n` and `k` are equal, the `print` statement will always print 'YES' when it is executed.

Output: **YES**
