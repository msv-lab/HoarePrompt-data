The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but they are not defined in the provided function definition. Based on the problem description, the function should take an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it should take an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. The integer `t` should satisfy 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, the integer `n` should satisfy 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
