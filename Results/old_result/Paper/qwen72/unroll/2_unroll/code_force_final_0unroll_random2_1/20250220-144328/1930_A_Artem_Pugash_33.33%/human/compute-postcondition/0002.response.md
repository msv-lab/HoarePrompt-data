Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 5000, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50, `a` is a list of 2n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^7, `numCases` is an input integer. After the loop, `numCases` is 0, `numbers` is an empty list, and `suma` is the sum of the minimum values of each pair of integers from the list `numbers` for each case.**
