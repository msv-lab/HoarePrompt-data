No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains four integers n, m, k, and d such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 100, 3 ≤ m ≤ 2 · 10^5, and 1 ≤ d ≤ m. The following n lines each contain m integers representing the depths of the river cells, with the constraints 0 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ 10^6 and a_{i, 1} = a_{i, m} = 0.
