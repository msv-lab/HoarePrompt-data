Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is designed to compute the difference between the last element in a list `arr` and the element at a specific position `max(-n, -1 - times)`.
   - The function is used to help calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters.
   - The function works correctly for the intended purpose, as it correctly handles the boundary conditions and computes the required difference.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is the main function that processes the grid and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting position.
   - The function initializes `pre` with the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s1`.
   - It then uses `accumulate` to create `preOne`, which is a prefix sum array of the indices of '>' characters.
   - `suffZero` is initialized as a list containing a single 0 and is used to keep track of the suffix sum of indices of '<' characters.
   - The function iterates over the string `s1` from right to left, updating `ans` for each position based on the current state of `preOne` and `suffZero`.
   - The logic for updating `ans` is complex but follows the rules described in the problem:
     - If the current character is '>', it calculates the time based on the positions of '>' characters to the left and '<' characters to the right.
     - If the current character is '<', it calculates the time based on the positions of '<' characters to the right and '>' characters to the left.
   - The function correctly handles the inversion of the characters and the movement of the pinball.
   - The final result is printed as a space-separated list of integers, which matches the expected output format.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2` with the appropriate inputs.
   - The `func_2` function correctly computes the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position, and the results are printed in the correct format.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
