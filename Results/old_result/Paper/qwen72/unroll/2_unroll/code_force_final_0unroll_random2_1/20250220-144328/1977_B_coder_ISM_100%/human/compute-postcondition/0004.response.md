Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (1 â‰¤ x < 2^30) and modifies its binary representation according to specific rules. The modified binary representation is stored in the list `s`, which may contain '1', '0', or '-1'. The function then prints the length of the modified list `s` (which can be 30 or 31) and the elements of `s`. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the original value of `x` is no longer directly accessible, but its modified binary representation is printed. The variable `t` is decremented by the number of test cases processed. **
