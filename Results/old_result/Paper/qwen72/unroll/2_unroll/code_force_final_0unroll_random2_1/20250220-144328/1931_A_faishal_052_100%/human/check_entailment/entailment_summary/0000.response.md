Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the encoded integer for each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `arr` for each test case to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then uses a loop to decode the integer `lex` into three positions.
   - The logic for decoding is as follows:
     - If `lex` is less than 28, it appends 1 (the position of 'a') to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 (the position of 'z') to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 78, it appends 26 (the position of 'z') to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.
   - The program then sorts `arr` to ensure the positions are in ascending order, which is necessary to find the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - The program constructs the final word by converting the positions in `arr` to their corresponding letters using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)`.
   - It prints the constructed word for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `lex` is 3 by correctly outputting "aaa".
   - It also handles the case where `lex` is 78 by correctly outputting "zzz".

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `lex = 24`, the program outputs "aav" which is correct.
   - For `lex = 70`, the program outputs "rzz" which is correct.
   - For `lex = 3`, the program outputs "aaa" which is correct.
   - For `lex = 55`, the program outputs "czz" which is correct.
   - For `lex = 48`, the program outputs "auz" which is correct.

However, there is a logical issue in the decoding process. The program should ensure that the positions are chosen in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order. The current logic does not always achieve this. For example, for `lex = 24`, the program should output "cat" instead of "aav" to be lexicographically smallest.

To fix this, the program should:
- Start by trying to use the smallest possible values for the first two positions.
- Ensure that the third position is the remaining value after subtracting the first two positions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    info = []
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr[j] = lex
                lex = 0
                break
            else:
                arr[j] = 1
                lex -= 1
        arr[2] = lex
        arr.sort()
        info.append(arr)
    for i in range(cases):
        temp = ''
        for j in range(3):
            temp = temp + chr(info[i][j] + 96)
        print(temp)
```

With this corrected logic, the program will correctly output the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **False**  
The original program does not always produce the lexicographically smallest word, especially for cases where the sum can be achieved with smaller letters.
