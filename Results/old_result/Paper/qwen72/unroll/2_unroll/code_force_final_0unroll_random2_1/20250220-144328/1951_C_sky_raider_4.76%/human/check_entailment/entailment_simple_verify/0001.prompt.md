You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `l`.

2. **Sorting the Prices**:
   - The program sorts the list of ticket prices `l` in ascending order. This is a good strategy because it ensures that the cheapest tickets are purchased first, which helps in minimizing the total cost.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `s` is initialized to 0, which is not used effectively in the loop.
   - The variable `c` is initialized to `k * k / 2`, which seems incorrect and unnecessary. The total cost `c` should be initialized to 0.

4. **Loop for Purchasing Tickets**:
   - The loop iterates over the sorted list of ticket prices.
   - Inside the loop, `s` is set to the minimum of `m` and `k`. This ensures that the number of tickets bought each day does not exceed the daily limit `m` and does not exceed the remaining number of tickets `k` to be bought.
   - The remaining number of tickets `k` is then reduced by `s`.
   - The cost `c` is updated by adding `l[i] * s - s * s / 2`. This formula is incorrect because it subtracts `s * s / 2` from the cost, which does not make sense in the context of the problem.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the integer value of `c` after the loop.

6. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to update the cost should be `c += l[i] * s`.

7. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `k` is 0 after the loop, which should not affect the cost.

8. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of buying the cheapest tickets first is correct, but the implementation has issues with the cost calculation.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
