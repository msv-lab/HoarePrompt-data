Precondition: **The function is expected to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a binary string s. The input to the function should be a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of lengths of all strings does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should accept a list of binary strings as input. Here is a corrected function definition:

```
def func_1(test_cases):
```

Precondition: **test_cases is a list of binary strings, where each string s has a length 2 ≤ |s| ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of lengths of all strings in test_cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
