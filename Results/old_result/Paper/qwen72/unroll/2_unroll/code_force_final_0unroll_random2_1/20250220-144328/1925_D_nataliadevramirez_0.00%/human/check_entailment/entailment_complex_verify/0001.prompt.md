You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n children in a class, m pairs among them are friends. The i -th
pair who are friends have a friendship value of f_i .

The teacher has to go for k excursions, and for each of the excursions she
chooses a pair of children randomly, equiprobably and independently. If a pair
of children who are friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1
for all subsequent excursions (the teacher can choose a pair of children more
than once). The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is considered 0
, and it does not change for subsequent excursions.

Find the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen
for the excursions (at the time of being chosen). It can be shown that this
answer can always be expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are
coprime integers. Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 5 \cdot 10^4 ). Description of the test cases
follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m and k (2 \le n \le
10^5 , 0 \le m \le \min \Big(10^5 , \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \Big) , 1 \le k \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of children, pairs of friends and excursions
respectively.

The next m lines contain three integers each — a_i , b_i , f_i — the indices
of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value. (a_i \neq
b_i , 1 \le a_i,b_i \le n , 1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ). It is guaranteed that all
pairs of friends are distinct.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and sum m over all test cases does not
exceed 10^5 and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    100 0 24
    
    2 1 10
    
    1 2 1
    
    3 1 2
    
    2 1 1
    
    5 2 4
    
    1 2 25
    
    3 2 24

Output

    0
    55
    777777784
    40000020
    
Note

For the first test case, there are no pairs of friends, so the friendship
value of all pairs is 0 and stays 0 for subsequent rounds, hence the
friendship value for all excursions is 0 .

For the second test case, there is only one pair possible (1, 2) and its
friendship value is initially 1 , so each turn they are picked and their
friendship value increases by 1 . Therefore, the total sum is 1+2+3+\ldots+10
= 55 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{7}{9} = 777\,777\,784\bmod
(10^9+7) .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of children, m is an integer representing the number of friend pairs, k is an integer representing the number of excursions, and friendships is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers (a, b, f) representing the indices of two children who are friends and their initial friendship value. The values must satisfy 2 <= n <= 10^5, 0 <= m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), 1 <= k <= 2*10^5, and 1 <= a, b <= n with a != b, 1 <= f <= 10^9.

    return result % MOD
    #The program returns the sum of (f * (k * (k + 1) // 2) % MOD) for each friendship (a, b, f) in the list `friendships`, modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of children), `m` (the number of friend pairs), `k` (the number of excursions), and `friendships` (a list of tuples representing friend pairs and their initial friendship values). It calculates the sum of the product of each friendship value `f` and the triangular number of `k`, modulo a constant `MOD`. The function returns this sum, and the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `friendships` remain unchanged after the function execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are passed to the function func_2, but it reads inputs from the standard input. The first input is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function reads three integers n, m, and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions, respectively. It then reads m lines, each containing three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9) representing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their initial friendship value.

        print(result)
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has executed `t` times. Each execution of the loop reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from input, reads `m` lines of friendship data, calls `func_1` with the provided arguments, and prints the result. No other variables are affected.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `m`, and the number of excursions `k`. It then reads `m` lines, each containing the indices of a pair of friends and their initial friendship value. The function processes these inputs by calling another function `func_1` and prints the result for each test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for `k` excursions.
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair who are not friends is 0 and does not change.
   - The answer should be given as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \).

2. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - For each pair of friends, the probability of being chosen in any given excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The expected number of times a specific pair is chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The expected increase in the friendship value for a specific pair over `k` excursions is \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} i \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

3. **Sum of the First `k` Natural Numbers:**
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \).

4. **Expected Value for Each Pair:**
   - For each pair of friends with an initial friendship value \( f_i \), the expected value of the sum of their friendship values over `k` excursions is \( f_i \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

5. **Total Expected Value:**
   - The total expected value is the sum of the expected values for all pairs of friends.
   - Therefore, the total expected value is \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).

6. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The final result should be computed modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) can be precomputed as \( \frac{2}{n \cdot (n-1)} \).

7. **Program Analysis:**
   - **Function 1:**
     - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of \( f_i \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) for all pairs of friends.
     - It does not account for the probability \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
     - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

   - **Function 2:**
     - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and prints the result.

8. **Missing Probability Term:**
   - The program is missing the term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) in the expected value calculation.
   - The correct expected value should be \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \cdot \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{n \cdot (n-1)} \).

9. **Modular Inverse:**
   - To compute \( \frac{2}{n \cdot (n-1)} \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), we need to use the modular inverse of \( n \cdot (n-1) \).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not account for the probability term \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \) in the expected value calculation.

Correctness: **False**
