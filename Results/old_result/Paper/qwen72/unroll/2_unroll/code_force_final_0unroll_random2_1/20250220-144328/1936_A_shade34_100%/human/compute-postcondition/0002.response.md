The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it interacts with a hidden permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is a non-negative integer with the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function's goal is to find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. It can make at most 3n queries, each involving selecting four indices (a, b, c, d) within the range 0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n, and receiving a comparison result between `(p_a | p_b)` and `(p_c | p_d)`. The function must handle multiple test cases, with the total sum of `n` across all test cases not exceeding 10^4.

Functionality: **The function interacts with a hidden permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, where n is a non-negative integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). It returns a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this, and it must handle multiple test cases with the total sum of n not exceeding 10^4.**
