The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The initial state provided does not directly affect the loop head, but it is important to note that the input must be a valid integer for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, with each integer from 1 to n appearing at most 2 times, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
