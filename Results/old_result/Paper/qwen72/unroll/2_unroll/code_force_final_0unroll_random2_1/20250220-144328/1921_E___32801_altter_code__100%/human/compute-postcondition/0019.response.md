Based on the given initial state and the precondition:

- `r` is a list of integers.
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2]`.
- `y1` is `r[3]`.
- `x2` is `r[4]`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an odd number.
- `y1` is not equal to `y2`.
- However, the current value of `y1` is equal to `y2`, which contradicts the precondition.

Given this contradiction, the program should not enter the if condition where `y1` is checked to be equal to `y2`. Therefore, the `print('Alice')` statement should not be executed.

Output: **(nothing is printed)**
