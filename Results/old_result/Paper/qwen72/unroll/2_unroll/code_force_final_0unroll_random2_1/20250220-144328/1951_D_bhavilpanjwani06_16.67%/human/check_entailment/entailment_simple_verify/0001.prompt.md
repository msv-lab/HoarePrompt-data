You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[Nightwish feat. Jonsu - Erämaan Viimeinen](https://youtu.be/QYlFn5q_UQk)

ඞ

Alice has n coins and wants to shop at Bob's jewelry store. Today, although
Bob has not set up the store yet, Bob wants to make sure Alice will buy
exactly k jewels. To set up the store, Bob can erect at most 60 stalls (each
containing an unlimited amount of jewels) and set the price per jewel for each
stall to be an integer number of coins between 1 and 10^{18} .

Fortunately, Bob knows that Alice buys greedily: and she will go to stall 1 ,
buy as many jewels as possible, then go to stall 2 , buy as many jewels as
possible, and so on until the last stall. Knowing this, Bob can choose the
number of stalls to set up, as well as set the price for each stall so that
Alice buys exactly k jewels. Help Bob fulfill the task, or determine if it is
impossible to do so.

Note that Alice does not need to spend all her coins.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

Each test case contains two positive integers n and k (1 \le n, k \le 10^{18}
) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to
have bought at the end.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if Bob can erect at most 60 stalls
and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels, or
"NO" if it is impossible to do so.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer s (1 \le s \le 60
) — the number of stalls to be set up by Bob. On the third line, print s
positive integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_s (1 \le p_i \le 10^{18}) that represent
such a satisfactory pricing p , where p_i is the price per jewel for stall i .
If there are multiple such p 's, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    7 3
    
    6 4
    
    255 8

Output

    YES
    10
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
    NO
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    
Note

In the first test case, at the first stall, Alice buys 3 jewels and is left
with 1 coin. This is not enough to buy any jewels for any of the remaining
stalls, so Alice buys exactly 3 jewels at the end.

In the third test case,

  * At the first stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 127 coins. 
  * At the second stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 63 coins. 
  * At the third stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 31 coins. 
  * At the fourth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 15 coins. 
  * At the fifth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 7 coins. 
  * At the sixth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 3 coins. 
  * At the seventh stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 1 coin. 
  * At the eighth stall, Alice buys 1 jewel and is left with 0 coins. 

Therefore, Alice buys exactly 8 jewels in total.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case using a loop. It also reads the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Initial Check**: The program checks if `n` (the number of coins Alice has) is less than `k` (the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy). If `n < k`, it prints "NO" because Alice cannot buy `k` jewels with fewer than `k` coins. This check is correct.

3. **Exact Match**: If `n == k`, the program prints "YES" and sets up a single stall with the price `n`. This ensures that Alice will buy exactly one jewel from this stall, spending all her coins. This is a valid solution because Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels (which is `n` in this case).

4. **Greedy Strategy**: The program then checks if `k - 1 < n - k + 1`. This condition is intended to determine if it's possible to set up two stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The idea is to set up the first stall with a price of `n - k + 1` and the second stall with a price of `1`. This ensures that Alice will buy `k - 1` jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling `k` jewels. This is a valid strategy because:
   - Alice will buy as many jewels as possible from the first stall, which will be `k - 1` jewels.
   - She will be left with `n - (k - 1) * (n - k + 1)` coins, which is `k - 1` coins.
   - She will then buy 1 jewel from the second stall, which costs 1 coin, and be left with `k - 2` coins, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.

5. **Remaining Cases**: If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints "NO". This is incorrect because it does not consider all possible ways to set up the stalls and prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, the program does not handle cases where `k` is large and `n` is large, but the difference `n - k` is not sufficient to use the greedy strategy with two stalls.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - Alice has 7 coins and needs to buy 3 jewels.
  - The program checks `n < k` (7 < 3) which is false.
  - It then checks `n == k` (7 == 3) which is false.
  - It checks `k - 1 < n - k + 1` (3 - 1 < 7 - 3 + 1) which is true (2 < 5).
  - The program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `5` and `1`.
  - Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 5 coins, left with 2 coins) and 2 jewels from the second stall (spending 2 coins, left with 0 coins).
  - This is correct.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
  - Alice has 6 coins and needs to buy 4 jewels.
  - The program checks `n < k` (6 < 4) which is false.
  - It then checks `n == k` (6 == 4) which is false.
  - It checks `k - 1 < n - k + 1` (4 - 1 < 6 - 4 + 1) which is false (3 < 3).
  - The program prints "NO".
  - This is incorrect because it is possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels. For example, setting up 4 stalls with prices `1, 1, 1, 1` would work.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
  - Alice has 255 coins and needs to buy 8 jewels.
  - The program checks `n < k` (255 < 8) which is false.
  - It then checks `n == k` (255 == 8) which is false.
  - It checks `k - 1 < n - k + 1` (8 - 1 < 255 - 8 + 1) which is true (7 < 248).
  - The program prints "YES" and sets up two stalls with prices `248` and `1`.
  - Alice buys 1 jewel from the first stall (spending 248 coins, left with 7 coins) and 7 jewels from the second stall (spending 7 coins, left with 0 coins).
  - This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where it is possible to set up the stalls and prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Specifically, it fails to consider cases where `k` is large and `n` is large, but the difference `n - k` is not sufficient to use the greedy strategy with two stalls.
