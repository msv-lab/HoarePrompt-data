The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `stones`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `stones` is a list of lists, where each sublist represents the piles of stones for a test case. Each sublist contains integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where each `a_i` is an integer in the range 1 to 10^9, and the length of each sublist `n` is in the range 1 to 2·10^5. The sum of the lengths of all sublists does not exceed 2·10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in `stones`. For each test case, the function determines the outcome based on the piles of stones and returns the appropriate result.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of lists `stones` where each sublist represents the piles of stones for a test case. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case, based on the piles of stones provided.**
