Reasoning:

The given program is not correct for the problem described. The program aims to find the minimum possible penalty by splitting the array `a` (derived from the string `s` with `+` and `-` characters) into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty as defined. However, the function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to find the optimal split of the array to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the number of `+` characters and the number of `-` characters in the string.

Here's why this approach is incorrect:

1. **Penalty Calculation**: The penalty for a subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The function `func_1` does not consider the length of the subarrays or the sum of the elements in the subarrays. It only calculates the difference between the counts of `+` and `-` characters, which does not align with the penalty calculation.

2. **Optimal Splitting**: The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty. The function `func_1` does not attempt to split the array or consider any possible splits. It simply returns a value based on the counts of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `+`, the correct output is `1` because the only possible split is `([1])`, and the penalty is `1`.
   - For the input `-----`, the correct output is `5` because the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`, and the penalty is `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5`.
   - For the input `+-+-+-`, the correct output is `0` because the optimal split is `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty is `0 + 0 + 0 = 0`.
   - For the input `--+++++++`, the correct output is `4` because the optimal split is `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`, and the penalty is `2 + 2 = 4`.
   - For the input `+---++++-+++++---++-`, the correct output is `4` because the optimal split can be `([1, -1, -1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1, 1, 1, -1])`, and the penalty is `3 + 1 + 0 = 4`.

The function `func_1` does not handle these cases correctly. It simply returns the absolute difference between the counts of `+` and `-` characters, which is not the same as the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **False**
