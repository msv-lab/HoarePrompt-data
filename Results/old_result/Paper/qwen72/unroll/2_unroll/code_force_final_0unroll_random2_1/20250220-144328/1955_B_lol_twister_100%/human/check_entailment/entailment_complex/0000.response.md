### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `c`, and `d` and the list `l` of `n^2` integers.
   - It then calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function starts by finding the minimum value `a` in the list `l`.
   - It then generates a new list `li` by iterating over the indices `k` and `h` from 0 to `n-1` and appending the value `a + k * c + d * h` to `li`.
   - Both lists `l` and `li` are sorted.
   - The function compares the sorted lists `l` and `li`. If they are equal, it returns 'yes'; otherwise, it returns 'no'.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly generates the elements of the progressive square based on the given rules.
   - Sorting both lists ensures that the order of elements does not affect the comparison.
   - If the sorted list `l` matches the sorted list `li`, it means that the elements in `l` can be arranged to form the progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints provided in the problem statement.
   - It correctly handles the case where the elements in `l` are in a random order.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the elements in `l` do not match the expected values for the progressive square.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement. It correctly identifies whether the elements in the list `l` can be arranged to form a progressive square with the given parameters `n`, `c`, and `d`.

### Correctness:
**True**
