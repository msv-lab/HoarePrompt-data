Output State: The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be called multiple times for different test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be reduced to 0, and the variable `s` will be the last string input provided by the user. The variable `s2` will be a shuffled version of the last string input `s`, and the loop will have printed 'Yes' followed by the shuffled string `s2` if `s` and `s2` are different, or 'No' if they are the same, for each iteration.
