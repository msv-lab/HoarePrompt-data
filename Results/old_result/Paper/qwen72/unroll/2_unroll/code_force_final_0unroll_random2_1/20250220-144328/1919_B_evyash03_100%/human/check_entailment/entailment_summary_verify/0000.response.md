### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The task is to split the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
   - The penalty for a subarray `c` is calculated as \( p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + \ldots + c_m| \cdot m \).
   - The goal is to find the minimum possible total penalty \( p(b_1) + p(b_2) + \ldots + p(b_k) \).

2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression`.
   - It then calculates the absolute difference between these counts and returns it.
   - This approach does not consider the splitting of the array into subarrays and the calculation of penalties for each subarray.

3. **Counterexample**:
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     6
     +-+-+-
     ```
     - The expected output is `0` because the array can be split into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, and the penalty for each subarray is `0`.
     - However, the provided program will output `6` because it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is `|3 - 3| = 0`, and then returns `abs(0 - 6) = 6`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
     - Convert the string `s` into the array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
     - Implement a dynamic programming or greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
     - Calculate the penalty for each subarray and sum them up to get the total penalty.

Given the above reasoning, the original assessment is correct. The program does not solve the problem as described and is therefore incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
