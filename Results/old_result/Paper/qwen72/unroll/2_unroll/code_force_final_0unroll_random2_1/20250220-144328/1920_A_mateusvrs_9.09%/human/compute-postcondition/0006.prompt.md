You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n such that 2 <= n <= 100, representing the number of constraints. Each of the n constraints is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct within a test case. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 in each test case.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        cx = set()
        
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        
        bx = -1
        
        for _ in range(n):
            a, x = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        
        if bx >= ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
        
    #State: `r` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of valid integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set `cx` for each test case. The length of `r` is equal to `t`, the number of test cases.
    print(*r, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: [r[0]]
    #[r[1]]
    #...
    #[r[t-1]] (where each r[i] is the number of valid integers in the range [bx, ax] that are not in the set `cx` for the i-th test case)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) representing the number of constraints, and each constraint is a pair of integers (a, x) where `a` is in {1, 2, 3} and 1 <= x <= 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the constraints provided, ensuring that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2 in each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
