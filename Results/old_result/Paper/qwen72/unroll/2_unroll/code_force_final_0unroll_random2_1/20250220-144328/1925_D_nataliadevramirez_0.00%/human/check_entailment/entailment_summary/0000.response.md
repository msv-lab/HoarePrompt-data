### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all pairs chosen for the excursions.
   - The friendship value of a pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if they are chosen.
   - The final answer should be given as \( p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9 + 7) \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are coprime integers representing the expected value as a fraction.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the sum of the product of each friendship value `f` and the triangular number of `k` (i.e., \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \)).
   - The triangular number \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \) represents the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, which is the total increase in friendship value if a pair is chosen every time.
   - The function then takes the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, and then reads `m` lines of friendship data.
   - It calls `func_1` with the read data and prints the result.

4. **Correctness of the Approach:**
   - The approach in `func_1` is to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends.
   - However, the expected value calculation is incorrect. The function assumes that each pair will be chosen every time, which is not the case. The correct approach should consider the probability of each pair being chosen.
   - The probability of a specific pair being chosen in one excursion is \( \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \), where \( \binom{n}{2} \) is the number of ways to choose 2 children out of `n`.
   - The expected value for each pair being chosen in `k` excursions is \( k \cdot \frac{1}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The total expected value for all pairs is the sum of the initial friendship values plus the expected increase for each pair.

5. **Correct Calculation:**
   - The correct expected value for each pair is \( f_i + \frac{k \cdot f_i}{\binom{n}{2}} \).
   - The sum of all expected values is \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( f_i + \frac{k \cdot f_i}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \).
   - This can be simplified to \( \sum_{i=1}^{m} f_i \left( 1 + \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \right) \).
   - The binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

6. **Modulo Arithmetic:**
   - The final result should be taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The modular inverse of \( \binom{n}{2} \) is needed to compute \( \frac{k}{\binom{n}{2}} \) under modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values. It assumes that each pair will be chosen every time, which is not the case. The correct approach involves calculating the probability of each pair being chosen and using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

**Correctness: False**
