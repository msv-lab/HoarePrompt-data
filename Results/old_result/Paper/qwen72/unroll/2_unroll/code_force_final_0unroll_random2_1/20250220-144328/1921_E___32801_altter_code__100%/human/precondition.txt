The function `pushp_` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9) representing the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, with the guarantee that either x_a ≠ x_b or y_a ≠ y_b. The sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
