Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the order of participants is consistent across all screenshots but the authors of the screenshots are in a different order than the one implied by the first two screenshots. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
2 3 1 4 5
3 2 1 4 5
```

The correct output should be "YES" because the order [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is consistent with all three screenshots. However, the program will output "NO" because it incorrectly assumes that the order of the first two screenshots must be the same for all subsequent screenshots. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the case where the first two screenshots are consistent but the order of the authors is different from the order implied by the first two screenshots.
