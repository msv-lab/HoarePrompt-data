### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in a permutation \( p \) of \( \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\} \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements from the permutation.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).

3. **Finding the Maximum OR Value:**
   - The first loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index \( v1 \) such that \( p_{v1} \) is the maximum value in the permutation.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{v1} \) with \( p_i \) for each \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) using the query \( ? \ v1 \ v1 \ i \ i \).
   - If the result is '<', it updates \( v1 \) to \( i \).
   - **Annotation Analysis:** This loop correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation because the bitwise OR of a number with itself is the number itself, and the loop updates \( v1 \) to the maximum value found so far.

4. **Finding the Second Index for Maximum XOR:**
   - The second loop iterates from 1 to \( n-1 \) to find an index \( prev \) such that \( p_{prev} \oplus p_{v1} \) is maximized.
   - It does this by comparing \( p_{v1} \mid p_i \) with \( p_{v1} \mid p_{prev} \) using the query \( ? \ v1 \ i \ v1 \ prev \).
   - If the result is '>', it updates \( prev \) to \( i \).
   - **Annotation Analysis:** This loop correctly identifies the index \( prev \) that maximizes the XOR with \( p_{v1} \). The bitwise OR operation ensures that the comparison is valid, and the loop updates \( prev \) to the index that gives the maximum XOR result.

5. **Output the Result:**
   - After the second loop, it prints the indices \( prev \) and \( v1 \) as the answer.
   - **Annotation Analysis:** The final output is in the correct format and should be valid for the given problem.

6. **Query Count:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - Total queries: \( 2(n-1) \), which is less than \( 3n \) for \( n \ge 2 \).
   - **Annotation Analysis:** The query count is within the allowed limit, ensuring the program does not exceed the maximum number of queries.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly identifies the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using the allowed number of queries. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
**True**
