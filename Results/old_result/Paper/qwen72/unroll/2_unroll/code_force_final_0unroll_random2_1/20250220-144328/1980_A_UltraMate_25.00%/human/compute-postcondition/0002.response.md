Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of n characters where each character is from 'A' to 'G'. The loop has finished executing t times, and for each iteration, the value of ans is printed. The value of ans for each iteration is the number of characters from 'A' to 'F' that are either missing from the string s or appear fewer than m times.**
