Functionality: ** The function `func_2` reads an integer from the user input, which is expected to be a positive integer between 1 and 10,000 inclusive. It then calls the function `func_1` that many times. The function does not return any value, and the input integer `numero_testes` remains unchanged after the function execution. **
