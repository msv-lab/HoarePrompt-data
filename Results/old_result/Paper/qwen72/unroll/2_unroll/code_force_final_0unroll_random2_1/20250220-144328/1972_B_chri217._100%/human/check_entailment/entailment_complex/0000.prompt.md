Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

# Annotated Functions:
import sys

cases = func_1()
for case in cases:
    print(func_2(case))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, representing the number of test cases.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is the integer value read from the standard input, and 1 <= t <= 100; `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`, both read from the standard input.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list `cases` containing `t` tuples, where each tuple consists of an integer `n` and a string `s`, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. Each `n` is an integer, and each `s` is a string, both read from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a number of test cases `t` from the standard input, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from the standard input. The function returns a list of `t` tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list where case[0] is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ case[0] ≤ 100), and case[1] is a string of length case[0] containing only 'U' and 'D', representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #The program returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in `case[1]` is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `case`, which is a list where the first element is an integer representing the number of coins (1 ≤ case[0] ≤ 100), and the second element is a string of length case[0] containing only 'U' and 'D', representing the state of each coin (facing up or facing down). The function returns 'YES' if the number of 'U' characters in the string is even, otherwise it returns 'NO'. The function does not modify the input `case` and only evaluates the state of the coins.
