Output State: **The loop will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' if the list `a` is non-decreasing or can be made non-decreasing by removing the first element, and 'NO' otherwise. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will no longer be in their initial states, as `t` will have been decremented to 0, `n` will have the value of the last test case's integer input, and `a` will have the list of integers from the last test case's input.**
