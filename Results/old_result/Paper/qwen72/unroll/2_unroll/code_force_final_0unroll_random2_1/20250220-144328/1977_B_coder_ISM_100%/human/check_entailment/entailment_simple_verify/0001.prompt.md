You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: The loop modifies the binary representation of `x` by flipping certain bits based on specific conditions. After all iterations, `x` is no longer directly accessible, but its modified binary representation is stored in the list `s`. The length of `s` is printed, which is either 30 or 31 depending on whether an extra bit was appended. The list `s` contains the modified binary representation of `x`, with some bits potentially set to '1', '0', or '-1'. The variable `t` is decremented by the number of iterations performed. The variable `nalla` is not used in the loop and remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The program initializes an array `s` to store the binary representation of `x` but with possible modifications to ensure the constraints are met.
   - It uses a loop to check each bit of `x` from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB) and appends '1' or '0' to `s` based on whether the bit is set or not.

3. **Handling Adjacent Non-Zero Elements**:
   - The program uses a flag to track whether a modification is needed to ensure no two adjacent elements are non-zero.
   - It iterates through the array `s` and checks for adjacent '1's. If it finds them, it sets the current element to '-1' and sets the flag to 1, indicating that the next element should be modified.
   - If the flag is set and the next element is '0', it changes the next element to '1' and resets the flag.
   - If the flag is set and the next element is also '1', it continues to the next element and sets it to '0'.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - After the loop, if the flag is still set and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'.
   - If the flag is still set and the last element is '1', it changes the last element to '0' and appends an additional '1' to the array, increasing the length by 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the array `s`.
   - It prints the elements of the array `s`.

### Analysis:

- **Binary Representation**:
  - The initial binary representation is correctly generated by checking each bit of `x`.
  - The array `s` is initialized with '0's and '1's based on the binary representation of `x`.

- **Handling Adjacent Non-Zero Elements**:
  - The logic to handle adjacent '1's is mostly correct. It ensures that no two adjacent elements are non-zero by setting the current element to '-1' and the next element to '1' when needed.
  - However, the logic for handling the last element and appending an additional '1' if necessary is a bit complex and could be simplified.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The final adjustments to ensure the constraints are met are also mostly correct, but the handling of the last element and the flag could be more straightforward.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should handle edge cases where `x` is a power of 2 or has a simple binary representation.
  - The logic for appending an additional '1' to the array when the flag is set at the last element is a bit convoluted and could be simplified.

- **Simplification**:
  - The logic for handling the flag and modifying the array can be simplified to make the program more readable and maintainable.

### Conclusion:

The program is mostly correct and handles the problem constraints as described. However, the logic for handling the last element and the flag could be simplified for better clarity and robustness.

### Correctness:
**True**
