The function `func` reads an integer `t` from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then reads `t` distinct strings of length 5, each consisting of the characters 'A' and 'B'. For each string, the function counts the number of 'A' and 'B' characters. If the count of 'A' characters is greater than the count of 'B' characters, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case to standard output. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the state of the program is as it was before the function call, except for the printed results.
