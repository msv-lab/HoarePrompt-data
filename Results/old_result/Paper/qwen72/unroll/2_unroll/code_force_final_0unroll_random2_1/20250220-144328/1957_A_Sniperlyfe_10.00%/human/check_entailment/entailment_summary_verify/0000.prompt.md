You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 4 for v in freq.values()))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` where the length of `arr` is between 1 and 100, and each integer in `arr` is between 1 and 100. It returns the sum of the integer division of the frequency of each integer in `arr` by 4. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only counts the number of squares (4-sided polygons) that can be formed, but it does not consider the possibility of forming other regular polygons with different numbers of sides (e.g., triangles, pentagons, etc.).

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
2 2 3 3 3 3
```
The expected output is `1` because we can form a square with the four sticks of length 3. However, the program will output `0` because it only checks for the possibility of forming squares and does not consider other regular polygons.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should consider the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed for all possible side counts (3 or more) and return the sum of the maximum number of polygons for each side count.
