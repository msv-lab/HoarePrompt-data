Let's break down the initial state and the conditions to determine what will be printed by the `print('draw')` statement.

### Initial State:
- `r` is a list of integers.
- `n` is `r[0]`.
- `m` is `r[1]`.
- `x1` is `r[2] + a`.
- `y1` is `r[3]` if `y1` < `y2` else `r[3] - 1`.
- `x2` is `r[4] - a`.
- `y2` is `r[5]`.
- `x2` is greater than `x1` if `y1` < `y2` else `x2` is equal to `x1`.
- The difference between `x2` and `x1` is an even number if `y1` < `y2` else an odd number.
- `a` is `r[5] - 1` if `y1` >= `y2` else `r[1] - r[5]`.
- `b` is the difference between `x2` and `x1`.
- `t` is the absolute difference between `y2` and `y1`.
- Additionally, either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine `a`**:
   - If `y1` >= `y2`, then `a` is `r[5] - 1`.
   - If `y1` < `y2`, then `a` is `r[1] - r[5]`.

2. **Determine `x1`**:
   - `x1` is `r[2] + a`.

3. **Determine `y1`**:
   - If `y1` < `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3]`.
   - If `y1` >= `y2`, then `y1` is `r[3] - 1`.

4. **Determine `x2`**:
   - `x2` is `r[4] - a`.

5. **Determine the relationship between `x1` and `x2`**:
   - If `y1` < `y2`, then `x2` is greater than `x1`.
   - If `y1` >= `y2`, then `x2` is equal to `x1`.

6. **Determine the difference `b`**:
   - `b` is `x2 - x1`.

7. **Determine the nature of `b`**:
   - If `y1` < `y2`, then `b` is an even number.
   - If `y1` >= `y2`, then `b` is an odd number.

8. **Determine the absolute difference `t`**:
   - `t` is `|y2 - y1|`.

9. **Check the additional conditions**:
   - Either `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`, `x1` is less than 1, or `x2` is greater than `n`.

### Conclusion:
Given the additional conditions, one of the following must be true:
- `x2` is less than or equal to `x1`.
- `x1` is less than 1.
- `x2` is greater than `n`.

Since these conditions are explicitly stated to be true, the `print('draw')` statement will always execute and print 'draw'.

### Output:
Output: **draw**
