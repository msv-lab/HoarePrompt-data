### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the array `a` of length `2n`.

2. **Array Splitting:**
   - The array `a` is split into two halves `b` and `c`, each of length `n`.

3. **Sorting:**
   - Both halves `b` and `c` are sorted. This ensures that any duplicates are adjacent in the sorted arrays.

4. **Constructing `ans1` and `ans2`:**
   - The function attempts to construct `ans1` and `ans2` such that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2`.
   - It starts by checking the first and last elements of `b` to see if they are unique or part of a duplicate pair. If they are unique, they are added to `l`.
   - It then iterates through the middle elements of `b` and `c` to find pairs of duplicates and adds them to `ans1` and `ans2` respectively.
   - Finally, it balances the lists by adding elements from `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2` to ensure they both have exactly `2k` elements.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the elements of `ans1` and `ans2` for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Handling of `l` and `k`:**
  - The function initializes `l` and checks if the first and last elements of `b` are unique. However, it does not handle the case where the first and last elements are the same correctly.
  - The function does not ensure that the bitwise XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` is equal. It only ensures that both lists have `2k` elements, but the XOR condition is not guaranteed.

- **Balancing `ans1` and `ans2`:**
  - The function attempts to balance `ans1` and `ans2` by adding elements from `l` to both lists. However, this approach does not guarantee that the XOR condition will be met.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly ensure that the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans1` is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements in `ans2`. While it constructs lists of the correct length, the XOR condition is not guaranteed to be satisfied.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function needs to be revised to ensure that the bitwise XOR condition is met for the lists `ans1` and `ans2`.
