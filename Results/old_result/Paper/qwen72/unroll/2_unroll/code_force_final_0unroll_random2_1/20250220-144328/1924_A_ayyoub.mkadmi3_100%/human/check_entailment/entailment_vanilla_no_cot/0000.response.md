Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. The function `func_1` is not designed to check all possible subsequences of length `n` but rather it is checking a specific pattern which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

Here are the issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**:
   - The function `func_1` is removing characters from the `alphabet` set and then checking if the length of `s1` is at least `n * k`. This approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` are checked as subsequences.
   - The logic of removing characters from the `alphabet` set and then resetting it is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the formation of all possible subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Incorrect Output for "NO" Case**:
   - The program attempts to construct a string that does not occur as a subsequence by appending a character that is not in `s1`. However, this approach is not guaranteed to produce a valid string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`.
   - The program should generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if any of them are not a subsequence of `s`.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. Generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. Check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`.
3. If any string is not a subsequence, print "NO" and the string.
4. If all strings are subsequences, print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    
    # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
    all_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
    
    # Check if each string is a subsequence of s
    for string in all_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(string, s):
            print("NO")
            print(string)
            break
    else:
        print("YES")
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Generate All Possible Strings**:
   - `product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)` generates all possible combinations of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets.
   - `''.join(p)` converts each combination (which is a tuple) into a string.

2. **Check Subsequence**:
   - The function `is_subsequence(x, y)` checks if string `x` is a subsequence of string `y` by using an iterator and the `all` function.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" and the string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks all possible strings and provides the correct output for each test case.
