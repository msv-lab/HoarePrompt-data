You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = input().split()
        a = int(a)
        b = int(b)
        t = b
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        a, b = input().split()
        
        a = int(a)
        
        b = int(b)
        
        t = b
        
        if t % 2 == 0:
            t = t // 2
        else:
            t = t // 2 + 1
        
        t1 = t * 15 - b * 4
        
        if t1 >= a:
            t = t
        else:
            t2 = a - t1
            if t2 % 15 == 0:
                t = t + t2 // 15
            else:
                t = t + t2 // 15 + 1
        
        print(t)
        
    #State: For each test case, the value of `t` is adjusted based on the input values `a` and `b` such that `t` is the minimum number of 15-minute intervals needed to cover the difference `a - t1` (where `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`), ensuring that `t1` is at least `a`. The final value of `t` for each test case is printed. The values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Screen Calculation for 2x2 Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons. Since each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells (5x3), the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is determined by `t = b // 2 + (b % 2 != 0)`. This is because:
     - `b // 2` gives the number of full screens needed for 2x2 icons.
     - If there is a remainder (`b % 2 != 0`), an additional screen is needed.

3. **Remaining Cells Calculation**:
   - The program then calculates the number of remaining cells on the screens used for 2x2 icons: `t1 = t * 15 - b * 4`.
   - If the remaining cells are sufficient to place all 1x1 icons (`t1 >= a`), the total number of screens `t` remains the same.
   - If the remaining cells are not sufficient, the program calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons: `t2 = a - t1`.
   - The number of additional screens required for 1x1 icons is `t2 // 15 + (t2 % 15 != 0)`. This is because:
     - `t2 // 15` gives the number of full screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - If there is a remainder (`t2 % 15 != 0`), an additional screen is needed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of screens required for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct. Each screen can hold at most 3 (15 / 4) 2x2 icons, and the program correctly accounts for the remainder.
- The logic for calculating the remaining cells and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons is also correct. The program ensures that all 1x1 icons are placed, even if they require an additional screen.

### Edge Cases:

- **Zero Icons**: If both `a` and `b` are zero, the program correctly outputs 0 screens.
- **Only 1x1 Icons**: If `b` is zero, the program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `a` 1x1 icons.
- **Only 2x2 Icons**: If `a` is zero, the program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for `b` 2x2 icons.
- **Mixed Icons**: The program correctly handles cases where both 1x1 and 2x2 icons are present, ensuring that the minimum number of screens is used.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly handle all the given test cases and edge cases. The logic and calculations are sound and follow the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
