### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, and the string `a` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Frequency Counting**: The function `func_1` initializes a list `count` of length 7 to zero. This list is used to count the frequency of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The program correctly increments the count for each character in the string `a` using the expression `count[ord(char) - ord('A')] += 1`.

3. **Calculating Needed Problems**: The program then iterates over the `count` list to determine how many additional problems are needed for each difficulty level. If the count of a difficulty level is less than `m`, the program calculates the difference `m - count[i]` and adds it to `needed_problems`.

4. **Output**: The program returns the total number of additional problems needed, which is stored in `needed_problems`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints well, ensuring that `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges and that the string `a` contains only characters from 'A' to 'G'.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case (`n=10`, `m=1`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`), the counts are: `A=0`, `B=2`, `C=2`, `D=3`, `E=1`, `F=0`, `G=0`. Since `m=1`, the program needs to add 1 problem each for `A` and `F`, resulting in `2` additional problems.
   - For the second test case (`n=10`, `m=2`, `a='BGECDCBDED'`), the counts are the same, but since `m=2`, the program needs to add 2 problems each for `A` and `F`, and 1 problem each for `B`, `C`, and `E`, resulting in `5` additional problems.
   - For the third test case (`n=9`, `m=1`, `a='BBCDEFFGG'`), the counts are: `A=0`, `B=2`, `C=1`, `D=1`, `E=1`, `F=2`, `G=2`. Since `m=1`, the program needs to add 1 problem for `A`, resulting in `1` additional problem.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed to hold `m` rounds. The state of the program and the output are consistent with the problem description and constraints.

**Correctness: True**
