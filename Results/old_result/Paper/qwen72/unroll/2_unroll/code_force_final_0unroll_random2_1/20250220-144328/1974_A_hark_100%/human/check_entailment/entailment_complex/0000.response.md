### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `ap` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Logic for Calculating Screens:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - The function calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen has 15 cells, so the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is the ceiling of `y / 2`.
     - It then calculates the remaining cells available after placing the 2x2 icons: `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
     - The remaining 1x1 icons are placed on the remaining screens, and the total number of screens is printed.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
     - The function correctly prints the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
     - The function correctly prints the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons, which is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
     - The function correctly prints 0, as no screens are needed.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles all edge cases correctly, including when `x` or `y` are 0, and when both are 0.
   - The function also handles the maximum values of `x` and `y` (99) correctly.

4. **Mathematical Correctness:**
   - The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the number of screens is always rounded up to the nearest integer, which is necessary because partial screens are not allowed.

5. **Overall Structure:**
   - The function is structured to handle multiple test cases, and the logic for each case is clear and correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly solves the problem as described. It handles all the given test cases and edge cases appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
