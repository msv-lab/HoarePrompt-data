The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits with a length between 1 and 20 characters. It returns `True` if the `password` is already sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., digits come first and are sorted, followed by letters which are also sorted). Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not modify the `password` string or any external state.
