Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for pairs of children chosen for excursions.
   - Each pair of friends has an initial friendship value, which increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion if the same pair is chosen again.
   - The expected value of the sum of friendship values is to be calculated for each of the k excursions, and the result should be given modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - This function calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for a single test case.
     - It iterates over each friendship pair and calculates the contribution of each pair to the total expected value.
     - The formula used is \( f \times \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \mod (10^9 + 7) \), which is the sum of the first k natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value.
     - This formula is correct because it accounts for the increasing friendship value over k excursions.
   - **func_2**:
     - This function reads multiple test cases from the standard input.
     - For each test case, it reads the number of children, pairs of friends, and excursions.
     - It then reads the friendship data and calls `func_1` to get the result for each test case.
     - The results are printed for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1**:
     - The function correctly calculates the expected value for each friendship pair.
     - The use of the triangular number formula \( \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \) is appropriate for summing the friendship values over k excursions.
     - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.
   - **func_2**:
     - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
     - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and prints the result.
     - The input and output handling is consistent with the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where there are no friends (m = 0) correctly by returning 0.
   - The function also handles the case where there is only one pair of friends (m = 1) correctly by calculating the sum of the first k natural numbers multiplied by the initial friendship value.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the solution for the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
