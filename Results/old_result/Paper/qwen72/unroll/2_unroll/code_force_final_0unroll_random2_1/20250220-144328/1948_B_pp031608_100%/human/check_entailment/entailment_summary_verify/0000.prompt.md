You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any values. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `m` and a list of `m` integers `arr`. The function then checks if the list `arr` can be made non-decreasing by changing at most one element. If it can, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function performs this check for each of the `n` test cases. The state of the program remains unchanged with respect to any external variables like `t` or `a` that might have been present before the function call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the program only checks and modifies the array when it finds an out-of-order pair, but it does not handle the case where the digits of the element being split can still cause the array to be unsorted.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program will correctly identify that the array can be sorted by splitting the element `12` into `[1, 2]`, resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 45, 67]`, which is sorted.

However, consider this test case:
```
Input:
1
3
12 28 5
```
The program will identify that `28` is greater than `12`, and it will split `12` into `[1, 2]`. The array then becomes `[1, 2, 28, 5]`. The program will then check if `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` is sorted, which it is not. However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the digits of the element being split can still cause the array to be unsorted. The correct approach would be to split `28` into `[2, 8]` and check if the resulting array `[1, 2, 2, 8, 5]` can be sorted, which it cannot.

Thus, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases where splitting elements can still result in an unsorted array.
