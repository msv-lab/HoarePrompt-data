Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the multipliers are not distinct. For example, consider the input:

```
2
2
3 3
```

The program will output:

```
-1
```

However, a valid solution exists for this case, which is to bet 1 coin on each outcome. The total amount bet is 2 coins, and if either outcome wins, you receive 3 coins back, which is strictly greater than 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
