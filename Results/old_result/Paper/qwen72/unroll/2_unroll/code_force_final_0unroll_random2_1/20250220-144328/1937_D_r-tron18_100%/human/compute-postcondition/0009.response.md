Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5). It computes a list `ans` of length `n` where each element represents the difference between the sum of indices of all '<' characters to the right of the current index and the sum of indices of all '>' characters to the left of the current index, adjusted by the total length of the string `n`. After computing the list, it prints the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. The function does not return any value. **
