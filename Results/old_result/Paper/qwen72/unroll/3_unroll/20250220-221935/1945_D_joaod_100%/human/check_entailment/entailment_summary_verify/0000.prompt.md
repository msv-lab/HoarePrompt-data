You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of people in a queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), a list of costs to bribe each person in the queue (`a`), and a list of costs to bribe each person between positions (`b`). For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue and prints this cost. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the input variables remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the cost to move to the desired position is not minimized correctly. Specifically, the logic for updating the `best` variable and the `total` cost does not ensure that Kirill will end up in the correct position with the minimum cost.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The expected output is `14`, but the program outputs `11`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program fails in this case:
- The program starts with `total = 0` and `best = sys.float_info.max`.
- It iterates from the last person to the first:
  - For `v = 3` (4th person in the queue):
    - `v > pos_final` (3 > 1), so it adds `min(9, 5) = 5` to `total`.
  - For `v = 2` (3rd person in the queue):
    - `v > pos_final` (2 > 1), so it adds `min(6, 8) = 6` to `total`.
  - For `v = 1` (2nd person in the queue):
    - `v <= pos_final` (1 <= 1), so it checks if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]` (best > 11 + 3), which is true, so it updates `best` to `14`.
    - It then adds `min(3, 3) = 3` to `total`.
  - For `v = 0` (1st person in the queue):
    - `v <= pos_final` (0 <= 1), so it checks if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` (best > 14 + 7), which is false, so `best` remains `14`.
    - It then adds `min(7, 4) = 4` to `total`.

The final `total` is `11`, but the correct minimum cost to move Kirill to the 2nd position is `14` (by swapping with the 2nd person and paying 3 coins, and then paying 11 coins to the 3rd and 4th persons).

This test case demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the minimization of the total cost to move Kirill to the desired position.
