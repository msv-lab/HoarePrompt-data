The only objects in the loop head are the variable `c` and the variable `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `c` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `cases` is an input integer representing the number of test cases and must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**
