Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the cost to move to the desired position is not minimized correctly. Specifically, the logic for updating the `best` variable and the `total` cost does not ensure that Kirill will end up in the correct position with the minimum cost.

Consider the following test case:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The expected output is `14`, but the program outputs `11`.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program fails in this case:
- The program starts with `total = 0` and `best = sys.float_info.max`.
- It iterates from the last person to the first:
  - For `v = 3` (4th person in the queue):
    - `v > pos_final` (3 > 1), so it adds `min(9, 5) = 5` to `total`.
  - For `v = 2` (3rd person in the queue):
    - `v > pos_final` (2 > 1), so it adds `min(6, 8) = 6` to `total`.
  - For `v = 1` (2nd person in the queue):
    - `v <= pos_final` (1 <= 1), so it checks if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[1]` (best > 11 + 3), which is true, so it updates `best` to `14`.
    - It then adds `min(3, 3) = 3` to `total`.
  - For `v = 0` (1st person in the queue):
    - `v <= pos_final` (0 <= 1), so it checks if `best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[0]` (best > 14 + 7), which is false, so `best` remains `14`.
    - It then adds `min(7, 4) = 4` to `total`.

The final `total` is `11`, but the correct minimum cost to move Kirill to the 2nd position is `14` (by swapping with the 2nd person and paying 3 coins, and then paying 11 coins to the 3rd and 4th persons).

This test case demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the minimization of the total cost to move Kirill to the desired position.
