The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of people in a queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`m`), a list of costs to bribe each person in the queue (`a`), and a list of costs to bribe each person between positions (`b`). For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue and prints this cost. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the input variables remain unchanged.
