Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position not greater than `m`. After all iterations, the variable `best` holds the minimum cost for the last test case, and this value is printed. The variables `t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are input values and not modified within the loop.**
