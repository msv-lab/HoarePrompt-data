You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for c in range(cases):
        na_frente, pos_final = map(int, input().split())
        
        custo_pra_trocar_a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        custo_pra_passar_b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        na_frente -= 1
        
        pos_final -= 1
        
        total = 0
        
        best = sys.float_info.max
        
        for v in range(na_frente, -1, -1):
            if v <= pos_final:
                if best > total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]:
                    best = total + custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                if custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                    total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
                else:
                    total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
            elif custo_pra_trocar_a[v] < custo_pra_passar_b[v]:
                total += custo_pra_trocar_a[v]
            else:
                total += custo_pra_passar_b[v]
        
        print(best)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position not greater than `m`. After all iterations, the variable `best` holds the minimum cost for the last test case, and this value is printed. The variables `t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are input values and not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts the number of people in the queue `n`, the maximum allowable final position of Kirill `m`, a list of costs to bribe each person `a`, and a list of costs to bribe each person between positions `b`. It returns the minimum total cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. If it is not possible, it returns -1.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
