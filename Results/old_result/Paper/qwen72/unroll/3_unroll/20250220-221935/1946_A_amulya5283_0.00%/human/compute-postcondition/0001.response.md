The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which ensures that the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1 and `i` is 0. The other variables, such as `test_cases` and `results`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `i` is 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, `results` is an empty list**
