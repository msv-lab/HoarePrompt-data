### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this list to extract the number of test cases `t` and the arrays for each test case. This approach is efficient for handling multiple test cases and large inputs.

2. **Sorting**:
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted. This is necessary to determine the median of the array, which is the element at the middle index for odd-length arrays and the element at the index `n // 2` for even-length arrays.

3. **Median Calculation**:
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct because it correctly identifies the middle element for both odd and even lengths of the array.

4. **Heap Initialization**:
   - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently find and increment the smallest element that is still less than or equal to the current median.

5. **Operations Calculation**:
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median. Each increment is counted as an operation. This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

6. **Output**:
   - The results are collected in a list and printed for each test case. This is consistent with the problem's requirements.

### Potential Issues:
- **Heap Initialization**: The heap is initialized with elements from the median index to the end of the array. However, for even-length arrays, the median is the element at `n // 2`, and we need to ensure that the heap contains the elements that are candidates for becoming the new median. The current implementation is correct for both odd and even lengths.

- **Efficiency**: The program sorts the array and then uses a heap, which is efficient. Sorting takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, and heap operations take \(O(\log n)\) time, making the overall complexity \(O(n \log n)\) for each test case, which is acceptable given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The approach is sound and the implementation is efficient.

### Correctness:
**True**
