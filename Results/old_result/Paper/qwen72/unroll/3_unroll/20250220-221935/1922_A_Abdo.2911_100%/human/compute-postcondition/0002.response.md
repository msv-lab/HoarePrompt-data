Output State: **The loop will have executed `t` times, and for each test case, it will have checked the conditions specified in the loop body. If the conditions for a test case result in `possible` being `True`, it will print 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain their values after each iteration, but their values will be overwritten in subsequent iterations. After all iterations, `t` will be the same as the initial input, and `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will be the values from the last test case.**
