You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if there is any position `i` in the strings such that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain the values from the last test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Conditions:**
   - A string `s` matches the template `t` if:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, then `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

3. **Conditions to Check:**
   - The goal is to determine if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - Both `a` and `b` match the template.
     - `c` does not match the template.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, then the template `t[i]` must be the lowercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - For `c` to not match the template, `c[i]` must be different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, then it is possible to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

   - **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, then the template `t[i]` can be either the lowercase version of `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
     - For `c` to not match the template, `c[i]` must be different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - If `c[i]` is the same as either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then it is not possible to construct a template that matches `a` and `b` but not `c`.

5. **Implementation:**
   - The function iterates through each position `i` of the strings.
   - It checks the conditions for each position:
     - If `a[i] == b[i]` and `c[i] != a[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is the same as either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next position.
     - If `a[i] != b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all the same length and contain only lowercase letters.
   - It correctly identifies when `a` and `b` can be matched to a template and `c` cannot.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and edge cases are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
