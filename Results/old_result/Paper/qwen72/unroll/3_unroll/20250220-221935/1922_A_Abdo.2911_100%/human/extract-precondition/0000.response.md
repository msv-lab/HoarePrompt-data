Precondition: **The function should take four parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer n and three strings a, b, and c. Each tuple represents a single test case. 

For the precondition, assuming the function is correctly defined as above:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), and `test_cases` is a list of t tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.**
