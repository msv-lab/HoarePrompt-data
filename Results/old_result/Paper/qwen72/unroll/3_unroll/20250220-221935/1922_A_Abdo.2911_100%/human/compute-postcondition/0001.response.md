To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state before the loop starts should ensure that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000).

State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000**
