### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function checks if there exists a template `t` such that:
     - `a` and `b` match the template.
     - `c` does not match the template.
   - The logic for this is implemented using a loop that iterates over each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Conditions for Template Matching:**
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then the template at position `i` must be an uppercase letter of a different character from `a[i]` and `b[i]`. The function checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (and hence `b[i]`), and if so, sets `possible` to `True`.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, then the template at position `i` can be either `a[i]` or `b[i]` in uppercase. The function checks if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, and if so, sets `possible` to `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints 'YES', indicating that a valid template exists.
   - If `possible` remains `False`, it prints 'NO', indicating that no valid template exists.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `a` and `b` are identical and `c` is different at some position.
   - It also handles the case where `a` and `b` differ at some positions, and `c` is different from both `a` and `b` at those positions.

6. **Execution Summary:**
   - The execution summary confirms that the function processes each test case and prints the correct output for each case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, while `c` does not. The conditions and edge cases are handled appropriately, and the output is consistent with the problem description.
