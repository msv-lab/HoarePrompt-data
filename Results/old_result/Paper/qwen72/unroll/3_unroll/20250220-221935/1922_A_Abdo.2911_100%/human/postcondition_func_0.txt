The function `func_1` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The function checks if there is any position `i` in the strings such that `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. If such a position exists, it prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will retain the values from the last test case.
