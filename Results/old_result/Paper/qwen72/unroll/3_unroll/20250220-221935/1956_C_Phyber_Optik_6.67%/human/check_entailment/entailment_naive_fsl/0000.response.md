Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of operations and the sum is flawed. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` and `sum += i * n` in a loop. This does not correctly reflect the maximum possible sum for the matrix.
   - The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n \times \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \right) \), which is the sum of all elements in the matrix if each row and each column is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is determined in a loop. This does not ensure that the number of operations is no more than \( 2n \).
   - The problem description guarantees that the maximum sum can always be obtained in no more than \( 2n \) operations, but the program does not follow this constraint correctly.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the operations in a format that does not match the required output format. For example, it prints `1, j, end=' '` followed by a permutation, which is not the correct format for the operations.

### Example Case:
For \( n = 2 \):
- The maximum possible sum is \( 7 \) (as shown in the problem description).
- The program outputs:
  ```
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```
- The correct output should be:
  ```
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```

However, the program's logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect outputs for other cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
