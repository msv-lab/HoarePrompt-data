Output State: **After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variables `n`, `sum`, and `r` will have been updated for each test case. For each test case, `n` will be the last input integer, `sum` will be the accumulated sum based on the conditions in the loop, and `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The loop will print the final values of `sum` and `n + r` for each test case, followed by a series of printed lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n + r`.**
