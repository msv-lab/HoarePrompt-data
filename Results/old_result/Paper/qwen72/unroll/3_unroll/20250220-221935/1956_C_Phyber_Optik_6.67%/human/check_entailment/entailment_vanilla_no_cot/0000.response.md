Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as required by the problem description. The problem requires that the sum of all elements in the matrix be maximized, which is achieved by filling the matrix with the maximum possible values using permutations. The maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( n \times n \times n \) because each element can be at most \( n \), and there are \( n^2 \) elements.

However, the given solution calculates the sum in a way that does not necessarily achieve this maximum. It also outputs operations that are not aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of operations and the values to be printed is flawed. Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The sum calculation in the solution is incorrect. It uses a loop to add values that do not correspond to the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The correct sum should be \( n \times n \times n \).

2. **Number of Operations**: The solution outputs \( n + r \) operations, which is not necessarily the correct number of operations. The problem guarantees that the maximum possible sum can be achieved in no more than \( 2n \) operations, and the solution should ensure this.

3. **Operation Output**: The operations output by the solution are not correct. The operations should fill the matrix with the maximum possible values, but the current solution does not achieve this. It prints permutations in a way that does not maximize the sum of the matrix.

A correct solution would involve filling each row and each column with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) in such a way that the sum is maximized. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        max_sum = n * n * n
        operations = 2 * n
        print(max_sum, operations)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum sum and outputs the operations to achieve it. Each row and each column is filled with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \), ensuring that the sum is maximized and the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).
