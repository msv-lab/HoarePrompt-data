### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We are given an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - We can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of \( 1 \) to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} = p_j \) for all \( j \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation**:
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - The sum of the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) is \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - Since we can fill each row and each column with this permutation, the maximum sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

3. **Operation Count**:
   - The problem guarantees that the maximum possible sum can be achieved with no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - We need to output the operations to achieve this sum.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) and updates \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) based on a condition that seems to be incorrect for the problem's requirements.
   - It prints the sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations, which are a mix of Type 1 and Type 2 operations, but the logic for determining the operations is flawed.

5. **Flaw in the Program**:
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not necessary for determining the maximum sum. The maximum sum is always \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The variable \( r \) is used to count the number of Type 2 operations, but the logic for updating \( r \) is incorrect and unnecessary.
   - The number of operations \( n + r \) is not guaranteed to be within the limit of \( 2n \).

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to perform \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - This will ensure that the matrix is filled with the maximum possible values, and the sum will be \( n \times \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).
   - The number of operations will be exactly \( n \), which is within the limit of \( 2n \).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and the number of operations. The logic for updating \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) is flawed, and the number of operations may exceed the limit of \( 2n \).

Correctness: **False**
