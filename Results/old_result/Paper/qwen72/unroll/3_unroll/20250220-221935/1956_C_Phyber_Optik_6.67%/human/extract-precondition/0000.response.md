Precondition: **The function `func` does not take any input parameters. However, based on the problem description, it is implied that the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The function should be designed to read input from stdin or another source, where the first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by t lines, each containing a single integer n.**
