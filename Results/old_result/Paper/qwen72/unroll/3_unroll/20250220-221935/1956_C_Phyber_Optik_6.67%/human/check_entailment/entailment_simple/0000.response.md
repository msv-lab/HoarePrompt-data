### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.

2. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates over `i` from 1 to `n` and updates `sum` and `r` based on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`.
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is used to decide whether to add `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` to `sum`.
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum possible sum for the matrix. The maximum sum should be `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)` since each row and column can be filled with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which sums to `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function prints `sum` and `n + r` as the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It then prints the operations. For the first `n` operations, it prints type 1 operations for each row, filling it with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - For the remaining `r` operations, it prints type 2 operations for each column, filling it with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Number of Operations**:
   - The number of operations `n + r` is not necessarily correct. The function should ensure that the number of operations does not exceed `2n` and that the matrix is filled correctly to achieve the maximum sum.

### Correctness:
- The sum calculation logic is incorrect. The maximum sum for an `n x n` matrix filled with permutations `[1, 2, ..., n]` is `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.
- The number of operations `n + r` is not guaranteed to be correct and may exceed `2n` in some cases.
- The operations themselves are not correctly designed to achieve the maximum sum.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Corrected Program:
To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Calculate the maximum sum as `n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)`.
2. Ensure that the number of operations does not exceed `2n`.
3. Print the operations to fill the matrix with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row and column.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible sum
        max_sum = n * (n * (n + 1) // 2)
        
        # Number of operations should be 2n
        num_operations = 2 * n
        
        # Print the maximum sum and the number of operations
        print(max_sum, num_operations)
        
        # Print the operations
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print(2, i, end=' ')
            print(*range(1, n + 1))

# Example usage
func()
```

This program correctly calculates the maximum sum and ensures that the number of operations does not exceed `2n`. It also prints the operations to fill the matrix with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row and column.
