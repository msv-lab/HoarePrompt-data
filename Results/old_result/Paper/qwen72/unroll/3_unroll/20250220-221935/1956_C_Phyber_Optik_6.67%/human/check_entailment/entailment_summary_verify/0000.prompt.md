You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        (sum, r) = (0, 0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n:
                r = i
                sum += n * (n + 1) // 2
            else:
                sum += i * n
        print(sum, n + r)
        for j in range(1, n + r + 1):
            if j <= n:
                print(1, j, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))
            else:
                print(2, j % n, end=' ')
                print(*range(1, n + 1))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). For each test case, the function calculates a sum and a value `r` based on the conditions provided in the loop. It then prints the sum and the value `n + r`. Additionally, it prints a series of lines, each containing a row of the matrix, with the first element being either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `j` (1 to `n + r`). The function does not return any values; all results are printed to standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of operations and the sum is flawed. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the sum using the formula `sum += n * (n + 1) // 2` and `sum += i * n` in a loop. This does not correctly reflect the maximum possible sum for the matrix.
   - The maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix filled with permutations of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( n \times \left( \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \right) \), which is the sum of all elements in the matrix if each row and each column is a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).

2. **Number of Operations**:
   - The program calculates the number of operations as `n + r`, where `r` is determined in a loop. This does not ensure that the number of operations is no more than \( 2n \).
   - The problem description guarantees that the maximum sum can always be obtained in no more than \( 2n \) operations, but the program does not follow this constraint correctly.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the operations in a format that does not match the required output format. For example, it prints `1, j, end=' '` followed by a permutation, which is not the correct format for the operations.

### Example Case:
For \( n = 2 \):
- The maximum possible sum is \( 7 \) (as shown in the problem description).
- The program outputs:
  ```
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```
- The correct output should be:
  ```
  7 3
  1 1 1 2
  1 2 1 2
  2 1 1 2
  ```

However, the program's logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect outputs for other cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
