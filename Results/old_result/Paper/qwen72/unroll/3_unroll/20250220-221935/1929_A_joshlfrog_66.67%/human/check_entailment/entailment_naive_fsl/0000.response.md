Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The program simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. However, the maximum beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences of consecutive elements after rearranging the array to maximize this sum.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
1 4 2 3
```

The correct output should be 6, which can be obtained by rearranging the array to `[1, 3, 2, 4]` (resulting in a beauty of `(3-1) + (2-3) + (4-2) = 2 + (-1) + 2 = 3`). However, the program will output `3`, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

This shows that the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases.
