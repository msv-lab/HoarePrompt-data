### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements `(a_i - a_i-1)` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. The goal is to rearrange the elements of the array to maximize this sum.

The key insight here is that to maximize the sum of differences, you should place the largest elements in the array at even indices and the smallest elements at odd indices. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.

However, the provided program does not follow this approach. Instead, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints this difference. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the sum of differences between all consecutive elements, but only the difference between the largest and smallest elements.

Let's analyze the program step-by-step:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the length of the array `l` for each test case.
2. **Finding Max and Min**: The program iterates through the array `nums` to find the maximum value `x` and the minimum value `y`.
3. **Output**: The program prints the difference `x - y`.

This approach will not always yield the correct maximum beauty of the array. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3]`:
- The correct maximum beauty is `(3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 2`.
- The program will output `3 - 1 = 2`, which is coincidentally correct in this case, but it is not the general solution.

For another example, consider the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]`:
- The correct maximum beauty is `(4 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = 1`.
- The program will output `4 - 3 = 1`, which is correct, but again, this is not the general solution.

For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`:
- The correct maximum beauty is `(100 - 90) + (90 - 80) + (80 - 54) + (54 - 43) = 10 + 10 + 26 + 11 = 57`.
- The program will output `100 - 43 = 57`, which is correct, but it is not the general solution.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. It only works for some specific cases where the difference between the maximum and minimum values happens to be the correct maximum beauty. However, it does not follow the correct logic to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

### Correctness:
**False**
