Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 500`. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `l` (which is not used in the function) and a list of integers `nums` from the input. It then calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in `nums` and prints this difference. The function does not return any value. After all iterations, the values of `t`, `n`, and `a` (if they exist outside the function) remain unchanged. **
