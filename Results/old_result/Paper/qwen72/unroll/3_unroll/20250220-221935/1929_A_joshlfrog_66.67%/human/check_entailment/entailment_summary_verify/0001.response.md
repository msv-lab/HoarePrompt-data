### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element.
   - The beauty can be expressed as: \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).
   - This simplifies to \(a_n - a_1\), because all intermediate terms cancel out.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the beauty, we need to maximize \(a_n - a_1\).
   - This can be achieved by setting \(a_1\) to the smallest element in the array and \(a_n\) to the largest element in the array.
   - The order of the other elements does not matter since they will cancel out in the sum.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(l\) and the elements of the array \(nums\).
   - It initializes \(x\) to 0 and \(y\) to a very large number (100000000).
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum value \(x\) and the minimum value \(y\).
   - Finally, it prints the difference \(x - y\).

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference.
   - The function does not return any value and does not modify the input values outside the function.

5. **Validation of Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the optimal strategy for maximizing the beauty of the array.
   - The program correctly implements this strategy by finding the maximum and minimum values and printing their difference.
   - The program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements and the function summary confirms that it behaves as expected.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.
