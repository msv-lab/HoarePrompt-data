Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not match the problem description. The problem description outlines a task to generate Python files (`-ac.py` and `-wa.py`) for every `.html` file found in subdirectories whose names are within a specified range of numbers. However, the program provided is a function `func()` that processes input to determine if a string of binary digits meets certain conditions and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. This function does not interact with the file system or generate files as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem.
