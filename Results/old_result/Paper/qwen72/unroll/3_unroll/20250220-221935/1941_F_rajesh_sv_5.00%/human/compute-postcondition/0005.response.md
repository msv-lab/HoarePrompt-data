The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will start with `i` being 1 and will run as long as `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 (since the loop starts at 1 and goes up to, but does not include, `n`).

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` remain unchanged**
