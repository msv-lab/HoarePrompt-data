Functionality: ** The function operates within a test case environment where it receives a sequence `p` of integers, which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4). It interactively queries the comparison of bitwise OR results between pairs of elements from the sequence `p` and finds a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise OR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized. The function outputs these indices (i, j) after performing at most 3n queries. **
