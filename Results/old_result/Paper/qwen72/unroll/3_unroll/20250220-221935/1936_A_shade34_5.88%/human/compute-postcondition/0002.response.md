The function `func` operates within a test case environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. It interacts with a sequence `p` of integers, which is a permutation of {0, 1, ..., n-1}, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can query the comparison of bitwise OR results between pairs of elements from the sequence `p` and must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, using at most 3n queries.
