Output State: **The function will print "NO" for odd values of n and for even values of n where the length of the generated string exceeds 200. For even values of n where the length of the generated string is less than or equal to 200, the function will print "YES" followed by the generated string. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the loop will have completed all its iterations.**
