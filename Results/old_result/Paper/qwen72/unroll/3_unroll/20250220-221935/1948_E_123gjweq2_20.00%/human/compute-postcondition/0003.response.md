Output State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`, `clique` is a positive integer, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged except for the new variable `not_mid`, which is assigned the value of `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given that `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`, `not_mid` is calculated as `right - left + 1 - (right - left) // 2`.
