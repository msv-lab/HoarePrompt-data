Reasoning:
The problem requires us to assign integers to vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques, and each vertex belongs to exactly one clique. The provided functions `func_1` and `make_array` are intended to achieve this goal.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Clique Calculation**: The function calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`. This is a reasonable approach because it ensures that the vertices are divided into segments of size `k` or less, which is necessary to form cliques based on the edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
   - **Array Initialization**: The function initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n` and filled with zeros.
   - **Segment Assignment**: The function iterates over the calculated number of cliques and calls `make_array` for each segment. This ensures that each segment of vertices is assigned to a specific clique.
   - **Output**: The function prints the elements of `arr`, the number of cliques, and the elements of `cliquess`.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - **Parameter Usage**: The function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters. `left` and `right` define the segment of the array to be modified, and `clique` is the identifier for the current clique.
   - **Element Assignment**: The function assigns values to the segment of `arr` in a specific pattern: the first half of the segment is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`, and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. This ensures that the values assigned to the vertices in each segment are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
   - **Clique Assignment**: The function sets the corresponding elements in `cliquess` to the value of `clique`, ensuring that each vertex in the segment belongs to the same clique.

3. **Edge Condition**:
   - The edge condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is implicitly satisfied by the way `make_array` assigns values to `arr`. By assigning values in a pattern that ensures the difference between consecutive values is small, the function ensures that the edge condition is met for vertices within the same segment.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The output of the program should match the expected format: the first line with the values assigned to vertices, the second line with the number of cliques, and the third line with the clique assignments for each vertex.
   - The provided example output matches the expected format and the logic of the functions.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and assign values to vertices such that the edge condition is satisfied. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
