Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `make_array` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`, and the variables `arr` and `cliquess` are not initialized properly in `func_1`. Additionally, the logic for assigning elements and cliques in `make_array` does not ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques as required.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

**Actual Output:**
The program will raise an error because `make_array` is not defined within the scope of `func_1`.

To fix this, the `make_array` function should be properly defined and called within `func_1`, and the logic for assigning elements and cliques should be carefully reviewed to ensure it meets the problem requirements.
