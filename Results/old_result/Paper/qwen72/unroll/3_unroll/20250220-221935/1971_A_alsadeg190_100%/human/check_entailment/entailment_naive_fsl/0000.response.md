Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description for every potential case. It reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then prints the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y` for each test case. The logic within the loop ensures that the correct order is printed for any pair of integers within the specified range (0 to 9). There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail based on the given constraints.
