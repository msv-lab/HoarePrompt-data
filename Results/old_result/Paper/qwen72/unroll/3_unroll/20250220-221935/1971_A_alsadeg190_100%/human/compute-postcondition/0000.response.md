Output State: **The function should be called within a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100. For each iteration, `x` is an integer provided as input, and it satisfies 0 <= `x` <= 9. `y` is an integer provided as input in the next iteration, and it satisfies 0 <= `y` <= 9.**
