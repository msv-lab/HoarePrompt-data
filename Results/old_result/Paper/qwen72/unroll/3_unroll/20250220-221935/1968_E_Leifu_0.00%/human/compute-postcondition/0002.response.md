Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop will print '1 1', '1 2', and if `n` is 3, it will print '2 3'. Otherwise, it will print '2 4' and then for each integer `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), it will print `j j`. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the variable `n` will be the last input integer read for the final test case.**
