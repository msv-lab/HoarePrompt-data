The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3) and prints `n` points in a coordinate system. The points are printed in such a way that they maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. Specifically, it always prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2). If `n` is 3, it prints the point (2, 3). Otherwise, it prints the point (2, 4) and then prints points (j, j) for each integer `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive). The function does not return any value. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and `n` will be the last input integer read for the final test case.
