The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` will start at 0, which is the default behavior of `range(n)`. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers with the constraints 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9; `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is 0**
