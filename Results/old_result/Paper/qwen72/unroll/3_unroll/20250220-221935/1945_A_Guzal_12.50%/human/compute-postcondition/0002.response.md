Output State: **The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are undefined after the loop, and `n` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: 
- The loop iterates `n` times, and within each iteration, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are read from user input, overwriting their previous values.
- The variable `k` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each iteration, and its value is printed at the end of each iteration.
- Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are redefined in each iteration based on user input, their final values after the loop are undefined.
- The variable `n` is not modified within the loop, so it remains the same as its initial value.
