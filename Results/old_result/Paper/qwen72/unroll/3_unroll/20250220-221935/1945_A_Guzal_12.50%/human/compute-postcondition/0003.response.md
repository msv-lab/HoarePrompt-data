The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. These parameters are non-negative integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively, with the constraints 0 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the given information.
