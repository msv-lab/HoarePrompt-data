### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of `y` coins. If he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`. If he loses, his coins decrease by `y`.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Sasha starts with `a` coins and wants to know if he can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
     - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from a series of losses. For example, if `x = 1` and `k = 2`, he can bet 1 coin and if he loses, he can bet 2 coins. This ensures he can always recover and continue betting.
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start the recovery process.
   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
     - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can lose `k - 1` times in a row, which means he can lose a total of `1 + 2 + ... + (k - 1)` coins.
     - The condition `a >= x + 3` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start the recovery process after losing `k - 1` times.
   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
     - If `x > k - 1`, Sasha can lose more than `k - 1` times in a row, which means he needs to ensure he has enough coins to recover from a series of losses.
     - The function calculates the total number of coins required to recover from `x` losses using a loop. The loop increments `z` by `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations, which simulates the recovery process.
     - The condition `a >= z` ensures that Sasha has enough coins to start the recovery process.

3. **Evaluating the Program:**
   - The program correctly handles the three cases based on the values of `x` and `k`.
   - The logic for calculating the required number of coins in the third case (`x > k - 1`) is correct. The loop simulates the recovery process by incrementing `z` in a way that reflects the number of coins needed to recover from a series of losses.
   - The conditions for printing 'YES' or 'NO' are correctly implemented.

4. **Testing the Program:**
   - The provided test cases are correctly handled by the program:
     - For `2 1 7`, the program prints 'YES' because `a = 7` is greater than `x + 1 = 2`.
     - For `2 1 1`, the program prints 'NO' because `a = 1` is not greater than `x + 1 = 2`.
     - For `2 3 15`, the program prints 'YES' because `a = 15` is greater than `z = 7`.
     - For `3 3 6`, the program prints 'NO' because `a = 6` is not greater than `z = 13`.
     - For `4 4 5`, the program prints 'NO' because `a = 5` is not greater than `z = 25`.
     - For `5 4 7`, the program prints 'YES' because `a = 7` is greater than `z = 7`.
     - For `4 88 1000000000`, the program prints 'NO' because `a = 1000000000` is not greater than `z = 25769803776`.
     - For `25 69 231`, the program prints 'NO' because `a = 231` is not greater than `z = 1125899906842624`.
     - For `13 97 18806`, the program prints 'NO' because `a = 18806` is not greater than `z = 1125899906842624`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can guarantee to have at least `n` coins for any integer `n` based on the given rules. The conditions and the recovery process are correctly handled.

Correctness: **True**
