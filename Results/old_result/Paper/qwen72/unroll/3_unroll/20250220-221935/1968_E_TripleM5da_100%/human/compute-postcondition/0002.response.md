The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships provided, it seems the function should accept two parameters: `t` and `n`. Here, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer for each test case such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine what it returns based on the given information.

However, if we assume that the function is designed to process these parameters and return some result, we can describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and `n` is an integer for each test case such that 2 <= n <= 10^3. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.**
