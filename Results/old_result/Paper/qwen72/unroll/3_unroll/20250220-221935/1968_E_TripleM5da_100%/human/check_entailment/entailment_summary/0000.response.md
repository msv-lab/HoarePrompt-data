Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program's approach is to print a specific set of points for each \(n\):

1. It always prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
2. For \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints the points \((i, i)\).

Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:

- For \(n = 2\), the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are printed. The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 2\) is indeed 2.
- For \(n = 3\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\) are printed. The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This is correct because the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 3\) is indeed 4.
- For \(n = 4\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\) are printed. The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has a size of 6. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 4\). The maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 4\) is 10, which can be achieved with a different arrangement of points.
- For \(n = 5\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\) are printed. The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}\), which has a size of 9. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 5\). The maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 5\) is 13, which can be achieved with a different arrangement of points.
- For \(n = 6\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\) are printed. The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}\), which has a size of 11. This is not the maximum possible size for \(n = 6\). The maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for \(n = 6\) is 16, which can be achieved with a different arrangement of points.

The program's approach of printing \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\) does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\). For \(n \geq 4\), the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is smaller than the maximum possible size.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for \(n \geq 4\).
