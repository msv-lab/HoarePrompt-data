### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` is called `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. However, the function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which is incorrect. The function should take `t` and `test_cases` as parameters to handle multiple test cases properly.
   - The function `func_1` reads input directly from `input()`, which is fine for a single test case but not for multiple test cases. The function should be designed to handle each test case individually.

2. **Array Modification:**
   - The program correctly modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is in line with the problem description.

3. **Set and Counter Usage:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts it in descending order. This step is also correct as it ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in the required order.

4. **Constructing the Lexicographically Largest Array:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array `b` by ensuring that the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2. This is done by adding elements between the sorted unique elements to fill the gaps.
   - However, the logic for filling the gaps is flawed. The program uses `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` to determine how many elements to add between `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]`. This logic is not entirely correct because it does not always ensure that the elements added are the largest possible while maintaining the gap of at least 2.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` in the correct format, but the elements in `ans` may not always be the lexicographically largest possible due to the flawed gap-filling logic.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program's logic for filling the gaps between consecutive elements in the sorted array `a` is not optimal. Specifically, the use of `min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)` to determine the number of elements to add between `a[i - 1]` and `a[i]` does not always ensure that the elements added are the largest possible while maintaining the gap of at least 2. This can lead to suboptimal solutions in some cases.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it always adds the largest possible elements while maintaining the gap of at least 2. This can be achieved by a more careful approach to filling the gaps, such as starting from the largest possible value and decrementing by 1 until the gap is filled.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from collections import Counter

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    for n, a in test_cases:
        for i in range(n):
            a[i] += i + 1
        
        counter = Counter(a)
        a = list(set(a))
        a.sort(reverse=True)
        cnt = n - len(a)
        ans = []
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if i > 0:
                gap = a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1
                for j in range(min(gap, cnt)):
                    ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
                cnt -= min(gap, cnt)
            
            ans.append(a[i])
            counter[a[i]] -= 1
            cur = counter[a[i]]
        
        for _ in range(cnt):
            ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
        print(*ans)

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))

func_1(t, test_cases)
```

This corrected code ensures that the elements added to fill the gaps are the largest possible while maintaining the required gap of at least 2, thus producing the lexicographically largest array `b`.
