#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, test_cases):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
        
    #State: For each integer `n` in the test cases, the list `a` will have each of its elements incremented by the corresponding index plus one. Specifically, for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, the element `a[i]` will be increased by `i + 1`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` will remain unchanged.
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        
        ans.append(a[i])
        
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        
        cur += counter[a[i]]
        
    #State: `cur` is 0, `a` remains the same, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, `counter` has all counts reduced to 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2.
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        
    #State: `cur` is 0, `a` remains the same, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, `counter` has all counts reduced to 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, and the last `cnt` elements of `ans` are each 1 less than the previous element.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of `ans` separated by spaces.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the conditions, the output will be the elements of `a` in descending order, with additional elements added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2. Since `cnt` is 0, no additional elements are added at the end.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a` from the standard input. After processing, it prints a list of integers `ans` where each element of `a` is incremented by its index plus one, and additional elements are added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements in `ans` is at least 2. The final state of the program includes `a` being a sorted list of unique elements (in descending order), `counter` having all counts reduced to 0, and `cnt` being 0. The variables `t` and `test_cases` are not used or modified by the function.
