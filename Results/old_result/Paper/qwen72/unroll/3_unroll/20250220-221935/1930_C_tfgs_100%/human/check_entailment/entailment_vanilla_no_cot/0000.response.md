Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the logic used to construct the lexicographically largest array `b`. The program attempts to adjust the values based on the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list, but it fails to correctly handle the unique insertion and the subsequent sorting to ensure the lexicographically largest order.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Unique Elements:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to track the occurrences of elements in the modified array `a`. However, the problem specifies that the set `S` can only contain unique elements. The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the same value might be inserted into `S` multiple times, and it incorrectly tries to adjust the values in the `ans` list based on the difference between consecutive elements.

2. **Incorrect Construction of `ans`:**
   - The program attempts to fill the `ans` list by adding elements that are not in `a` but are between consecutive elements in the sorted `a`. This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the elements added are the largest possible unique values that can be inserted into `S`.

3. **Incorrect Final Adjustment:**
   - The program appends the last element of `ans` minus one for the remaining count of `cnt`. This is not a correct way to ensure the lexicographically largest order, as it does not consider the unique nature of the set `S`.

**Correct Approach:**

To correctly solve the problem, you need to ensure that each insertion into the set `S` is unique and that the final array `b` is constructed in a way that maximizes its lexicographical order. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Step 1: Perform the operations to insert a_i + i into S
    S = set()
    for i in range(n):
        S.add(a[i] + i + 1)
    
    # Step 2: Construct the array b from the set S in decreasing order
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 3: Print the result
    print(*b)
```

**Explanation of the Correct Approach:**
1. **Insertion into Set `S`:**
   - For each element `a[i]` in the array, compute `a[i] + i + 1` and insert it into the set `S`. This ensures that only unique elements are added to `S`.

2. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - Convert the set `S` to a sorted list in decreasing order. This gives the lexicographically largest possible array `b`.

3. **Output:**
   - Print the elements of `b` in the required format.

This approach correctly handles the unique insertion and ensures that the final array `b` is lexicographically largest.
