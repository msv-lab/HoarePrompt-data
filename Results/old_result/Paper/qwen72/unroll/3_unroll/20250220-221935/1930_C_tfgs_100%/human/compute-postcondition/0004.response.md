Output State: **For each integer `n` in the test cases, the list `a` will have each of its elements incremented by the corresponding index plus one. Specifically, for each `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, the element `a[i]` will be increased by `i + 1`. The variables `t` and `test_cases` will remain unchanged. `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`.**

Explanation:
- The list `a` has been updated as described in the initial state.
- The variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged.
- A new variable `counter` is created, which is a `Counter` object from the `collections` module. This `counter` object contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`.
