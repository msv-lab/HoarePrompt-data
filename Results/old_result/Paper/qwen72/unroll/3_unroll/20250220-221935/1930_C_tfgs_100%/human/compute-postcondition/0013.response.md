Output State: **`cur` is 0, `a` remains the same, `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, `counter` has all counts reduced to 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` contains all elements of `a` in descending order with additional elements added to ensure the difference between consecutive elements is at least 2, and the last `cnt` elements of `ans` are each 1 less than the previous element.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `cnt` times.
- In each iteration, the loop appends the last element of `ans` minus 1 to `ans`.
- After `cnt` iterations, the last `cnt` elements of `ans` will form a sequence where each element is 1 less than the previous one.
- The other variables (`cur`, `a`, `t`, `test_cases`, and `counter`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
