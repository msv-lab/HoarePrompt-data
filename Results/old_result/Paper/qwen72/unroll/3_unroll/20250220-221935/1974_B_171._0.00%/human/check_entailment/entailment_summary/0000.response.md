Reasoning:

The provided program aims to decode a string that has been encoded using a specific algorithm. However, the program does not correctly implement the decoding process based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` from the distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order, and then replacing each character in `s` with its symmetric character in `r`. To decode, we need to reverse this process.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` creates a dictionary `mapping` to map each character in the encoded string to a unique lowercase letter.
   - The mapping is done by iterating over the characters in the encoded string and assigning the next available lowercase letter that is not already in the values of the `mapping` dictionary.
   - This approach does not consider the symmetric nature of the encoding. Instead, it assigns a new character to each unique character in the encoded string, which is not the correct way to decode the string.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To decode, we need to reconstruct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string.
   - Then, we should create a mapping where the first character of `r` maps to the last character of `r`, the second character of `r` maps to the second-to-last character of `r`, and so on.
   - Finally, we should use this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string to get the original string.

4. **Example**:
   - For the encoded string "serofedsoc":
     - The auxiliary string `r` would be "cdefors".
     - The correct mapping would be: 's' -> 'c', 'e' -> 'o', 'r' -> 'd', 'o' -> 'e', 'f' -> 'f', 'd' -> 'r', 'c' -> 's'.
     - Using this mapping, the decoded string would be "codeforces".

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation does not follow the correct decoding logic.
   - The program will produce incorrect results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **False**
