Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the construction of the `mapping` dictionary, which is supposed to map each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the original string based on the symmetric property of the auxiliary string `r`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
codeforces
```

**Actual Output:**
```
abcdeffedc
```

The program incorrectly maps each character in the encoded string to a new character without considering the symmetric property of the auxiliary string `r`. For example, it maps 's' to 'a', 'e' to 'b', and so on, instead of mapping 's' to 'c', 'e' to 'o', and so on, as required by the problem description. This results in an incorrect decoded string.
