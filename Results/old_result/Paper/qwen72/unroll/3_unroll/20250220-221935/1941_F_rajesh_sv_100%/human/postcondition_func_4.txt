The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `delimiter` and returns a list of integers. This list is generated by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the `delimiter` and then converting each split part to an integer. The final state of the program includes the returned list of integers, and the `delimiter` remains unchanged.
