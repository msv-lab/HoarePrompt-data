To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`ans`**: This variable is defined as the minimum of the initial `max_diff` and the maximum differences found during the binary search for each `f` in `F`.
2. **`next_max_diff`**: This variable is another value that is given in the initial state.
3. **`max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F`**: These values remain unchanged.

The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
- **`ans`**: This is the result of the minimum operation between `max_diff` and the maximum differences found during the binary search for each `f` in `F`. Therefore, `ans` is the smallest value among these maximum differences.
- **`next_max_diff`**: This is a given value that remains unchanged.

The `max` function will compare these two values and print the larger one.

### Output:
The `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where ans is the minimum of the initial max_diff and the maximum differences found during the binary search for each f in F, and next_max_diff is the given value)**
