Output State: **The console screen is cleared. `s` is assigned the value 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. `t` is an input integer. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, if `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed followed by a string `ans` that contains `n` special characters. The string `ans` is constructed by repeating each character from `s` twice, starting from the first character, until the required length `n` is reached. If `n` is odd, the string `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the pattern.**
