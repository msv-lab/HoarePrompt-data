### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `n`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if `n == 1`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a special character must have a neighbor, and if there is only one special character, it cannot be equal to exactly one of its neighbors without violating the condition for other characters.
   - For `n == 1`, the program correctly outputs 'NO'.

3. **String Construction:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string `ans` with exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating each character from the alphabet twice, which ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct and follows the problem description.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to repeat each character from the alphabet twice, ensuring that the total number of special characters is `n`.
   - The string `ans` is constructed to have a length of at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`.
   - This follows the problem description and ensures that the output is in the correct format.

5. **Edge Cases and General Behavior:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1.
   - For even `n`, the program constructs a string with exactly `n` special characters by repeating each character twice.
   - For odd `n`, the program starts with 'AAA' and then continues the pattern, ensuring the string has exactly `n` special characters.
   - The program ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is a valid constraint.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, special cases, string construction, and output as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
