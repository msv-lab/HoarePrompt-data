Output State: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function should be able to process a number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), where each test case is provided as an input to the function. The console screen is cleared. `s` is assigned the value 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. `t` is an input integer.**
