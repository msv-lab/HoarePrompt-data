### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `n`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if `n == 1`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a special character must have a neighbor, and if there is only one special character, it cannot be equal to exactly one of its neighbors without violating the condition for other characters.
   - For `n == 1`, the program correctly outputs 'NO'.

3. **String Construction:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string `ans` with exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating each character from the alphabet twice, which ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct and follows the problem's requirements.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to repeat each character from the alphabet twice, ensuring that the total number of special characters is `n`. This is also correct because starting with 'AAA' and then repeating characters twice ensures that the total number of special characters is `n` and the string length is within the limit of 200.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`.
   - This follows the problem description and ensures that the output is in the correct format.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case of `n == 1` correctly.
   - For `n == 2`, the program constructs 'AA', which is correct.
   - For `n == 3`, the program constructs 'AAA', which is correct.
   - For larger values of `n`, the program constructs the string by repeating characters, ensuring that the number of special characters is exactly `n`.

6. **Console Clearing:**
   - The program uses `os.system('cls')` to clear the console screen. This is not strictly necessary for the problem's correctness but does not affect the program's functionality in solving the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles the input, special cases, string construction, and output as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
