You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function should be able to process a number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), where each test case is provided as an input to the function.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The console screen is cleared. `s` is assigned the value 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. `t` is an input integer. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each test case, if `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed followed by a string `ans` that contains `n` special characters. The string `ans` is constructed by repeating each character from `s` twice, starting from the first character, until the required length `n` is reached. If `n` is odd, the string `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the pattern.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading an integer `n`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the problem description.

2. **Special Case Handling:**
   - The program checks if `n == 1`. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors. This is correct because a special character must have a neighbor, and if there is only one special character, it cannot be equal to exactly one of its neighbors without violating the condition for other characters.
   - For `n == 1`, the program correctly outputs 'NO'.

3. **String Construction:**
   - For `n > 1`, the program constructs a string `ans` with exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating each character from the alphabet twice, which ensures that each character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' (which has 3 special characters) and then continues to repeat each character from the alphabet twice, ensuring that the total number of special characters is `n`.
   - The string `ans` is constructed to have a length of at most 200, which is within the problem's constraints.

4. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string `ans`.
   - This follows the problem description and ensures that the output is in the correct format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input, special cases, string construction, and output as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
