The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case is defined by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of special characters required in the string. The function should be able to process a number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50), where each test case is provided as an input to the function.
