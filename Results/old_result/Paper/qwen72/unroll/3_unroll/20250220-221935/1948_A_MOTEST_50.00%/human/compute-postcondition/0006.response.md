Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It clears the console screen and then processes a series of test cases. The number of test cases, `t`, is taken as input from the user, and for each test case, another input `n` is taken, representing the number of special characters required in a string. If `n` is 1, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans` that contains exactly `n` characters. For even `n`, `ans` is constructed by repeating each character from the uppercase alphabet twice, starting from 'A'. For odd `n`, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the same repeating pattern until the length `n` is reached. The function does not return any value. **
