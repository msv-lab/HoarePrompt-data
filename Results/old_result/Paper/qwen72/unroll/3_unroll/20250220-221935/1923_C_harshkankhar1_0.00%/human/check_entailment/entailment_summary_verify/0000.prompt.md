You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes an array `a` of positive integers and a number of queries `q`. It computes a cumulative sum array `b` based on the condition that each element in `a` is either 1 or 2 (1 if the element is greater than 1, otherwise 2). It then modifies `a` to be its own cumulative sum array. For each query `(x, y)`, the function prints 'YES' if the sum of elements in the subarray `a[x:y]` is greater than or equal to the corresponding sum in `b[x:y]` and `x != y`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of the queries. After the function concludes, `a` is a list of cumulative sums of its original values, and `b` is a list of cumulative sums based on the condition `a[i] > 1`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Function Call Issue**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined, which will result in a `NameError` when the program is run. The function should be defined before it is called.

2. **Output Issue**: The program prints the accumulated array `a` using `print(*a)`, which is not required by the problem description. The problem only asks to print "YES" or "NO" for each query.

3. **Logic Issue**: The logic for determining if a subarray is good is flawed. The program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[y] - a[x - 1]` is less than the sum of the subarray `b[y] - b[x - 1]` or if `x == y`. However, this does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the condition `x == y` is not sufficient to determine if a subarray is not good. A subarray of length 1 can be good if there exists a `b_i` that meets the conditions (e.g., if `c_i` is 1, then `b_i` can be 2).

4. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle the edge case where the subarray is of length 1 correctly. For a subarray of length 1 to be good, there must exist a `b_i` such that `b_i > 0` and `b_i != c_i`. The current logic does not check this properly.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```
For the query `4 4`, the subarray is `[4]`. The program will print "NO" because `x == y`. However, this subarray can be good if `b_4` is set to 5, which satisfies all the conditions:
- \(\sum_{i=1}^{1} a_i = 4\) and \(\sum_{i=1}^{1} b_i = 5\)
- \(a_4 \neq b_4\)
- \(b_4 > 0\)

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
