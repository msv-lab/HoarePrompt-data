Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining if a subarray of `c` is "good" based on the criteria provided. However, there are several issues with the program that prevent it from being correct:

1. **Function Call and Definition Mismatch**: The function `func_1` is called without any arguments, but it is defined to take no arguments. This is a mismatch, as the function should be taking the test case input as parameters.

2. **Variable Naming**: The variable `a` is used to store the input array, but the problem description mentions an array `c`. This is a naming inconsistency, although it does not affect the logic of the program.

3. **Logic for Determining Good Subarray**: The logic for determining if a subarray is good is flawed. The program calculates the cumulative sums of `a` and `b` and then checks if the sum of the subarray `a[x:y+1]` is less than the sum of the subarray `b[x:y+1]` or if `x == y`. This logic is incorrect because:
   - The condition `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` is not the correct way to determine if a subarray is good. The correct condition should be that the sum of the subarray `a[x:y+1]` is equal to the sum of the subarray `b[x:y+1]` and that all elements in `b` are different from the corresponding elements in `a` and are positive.
   - The condition `x == y` is not sufficient to determine if a subarray is not good. A subarray of length 1 can be good if there exists a positive integer `b_i` such that `b_i != a_i`.

4. **Cumulative Sum Calculation for `b`**: The cumulative sum for `b` is calculated based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. This is incorrect because the problem requires that `b_i` is different from `a_i` and positive. The program should ensure that `b_i` is a positive integer different from `a_i` for every `i`.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the cumulative sums of `a` using `print(*a)`, which is not required by the problem statement. The problem only requires printing "YES" or "NO" for each query.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
