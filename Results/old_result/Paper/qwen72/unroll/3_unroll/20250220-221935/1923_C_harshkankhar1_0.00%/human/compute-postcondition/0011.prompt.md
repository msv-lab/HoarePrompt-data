You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should take parameters for the array `c`, the number of queries `q`, and the queries themselves. The array `c` is a list of positive integers, and the number of queries `q` is a non-negative integer. Each query is a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`, and `n` is the length of the array `c`. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed `3 * 10^5`.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` remains the same, `c` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` starting from `b[0] = 0`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 1 3 6 10 (where the values are the cumulative sums of the original values of list `a`)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: `n` remains the same, `q` remains the same, `a` is now a list of cumulative sums of its original values, `c` remains the same, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[i]` (for `i` from 1 to `n`) is the cumulative sum of `1` or `2` based on the condition `a[i] > 1` starting from `b[0] = 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an array `c` of positive integers, a non-negative integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of `q` queries, each a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)`. It returns a list of results for each query, where each result is based on the subarray `c[l_i-1:r_i]`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
