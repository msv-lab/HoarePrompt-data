You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are digits such that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIRS')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The loop has completed all iterations, and the values of t, a, b, and c remain unchanged. The output state depends on the input values provided for each test case during the loop execution. For each test case, if a < b < c, 'STAIRS' is printed; if a < b > c, 'PEAK' is printed; otherwise, 'NONE' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three digits `a`, `b`, and `c` (0 <= a, b, c <= 9) from the input. Based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the function prints 'STAIRS' if `a < b < c`, 'PEAK' if `a < b > c`, and 'NONE' for all other cases. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer relevant.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the digits are equal. According to the problem description, if all three digits are the same (e.g., `0 0 0`), the output should be "NONE". However, the current implementation will incorrectly output "STAIRS" for the input `0 0 0` because the condition `a < b < c` is not strictly checked for inequality. The correct condition should be `a < b and b < c` for a stair and `a < b and b > c` for a peak. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b and b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

This version will correctly handle all edge cases, including when the digits are equal.
