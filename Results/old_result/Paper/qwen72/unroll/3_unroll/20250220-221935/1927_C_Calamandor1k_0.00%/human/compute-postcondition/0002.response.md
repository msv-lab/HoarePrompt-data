Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are the last input integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is the last input even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is the last input list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, b is the last input list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6, len_a is the length of the last input list a, len_b is the length of the last input list b, count_a is the number of elements in the last input list a that are less than or equal to k and within the first max(len_a, len_b) elements, count_b is the number of elements in the last input list b that are less than or equal to k and within the first max(len_a, len_b) elements, d is k // 2, and the loop has printed 'YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d, otherwise 'NO'.**.
