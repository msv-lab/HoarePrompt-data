Functionality: ** The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates and prints the number of integers in `a` that are greater than both the smallest and the second smallest integers in the list. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The initial state of `t` and the sum of `n` over all test cases remains unchanged. **
