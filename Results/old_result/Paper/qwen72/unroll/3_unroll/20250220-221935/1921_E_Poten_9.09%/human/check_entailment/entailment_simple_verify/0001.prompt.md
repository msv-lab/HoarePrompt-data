You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/d2faa6ca73d70e765c2cc6ef0834e24c2e4a5528.png)
Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a game problem but lacks parameters in its definition. The correct function definition should include parameters for the board dimensions `h` and `w`, and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(x_a, y_a)` and `(x_b, y_b)`. The correct function definition should be: `def func(h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b):` where `h` and `w` are the height and width of the board, respectively, and `x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b` are the initial coordinates of Alice's and Bob's chips, with the constraints: 1 ≤ `x_a`, `x_b` ≤ `h` ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ `y_a`, `y_b` ≤ `w` ≤ 10^9, and it is guaranteed that either `x_a` ≠ `x_b` or `y_a` ≠ `y_b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the input values `h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - If `x_a` (Alice's row) is greater than `x_b` (Bob's row) or the board height `h` is 1, the game will end in a draw. This is because:
     - If `x_a > x_b`, Alice cannot catch Bob as she can only move down and Bob can only move up.
     - If `h == 1`, neither player can move, so the game ends in a draw.

3. **Parity Check:**
   - The function checks the parity (even or odd) of `x_a` and `x_b`.
   - If both `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity (both even or both odd):
     - If `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins because he can always move to the same column as Alice.
     - If `y_a < y_b`:
       - If the absolute difference between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1, the function checks if Alice or Bob can move to the same column within the remaining rows. If they can, it's a draw; otherwise, Bob wins.
       - If the absolute difference is 1, the function checks if Alice or Bob can move to the same column within the remaining rows. If they can, it's a draw; otherwise, Bob wins.
     - If `y_a > y_b`:
       - If the absolute difference between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1, the function checks if Alice or Bob can move to the same column within the remaining rows. If they can, it's a draw; otherwise, Bob wins.
       - If the absolute difference is 1, the function checks if Alice or Bob can move to the same column within the remaining rows. If they can, it's a draw; otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Different Parity:**
   - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities:
     - If `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins because she can always move to the same column as Bob.
     - If `y_a < y_b`:
       - If the absolute difference between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1, the function checks if Alice or Bob can move to the same column within the remaining rows. If they can, it's a draw; otherwise, Alice wins.
       - If the absolute difference is 1, the function checks if Alice or Bob can move to the same column within the remaining rows. If they can, it's a draw; otherwise, Alice wins.
     - If `y_a > y_b`:
       - If the absolute difference between `y_a` and `y_b` is greater than 1, the function checks if Alice or Bob can move to the same column within the remaining rows. If they can, it's a draw; otherwise, Alice wins.
       - If the absolute difference is 1, the function checks if Alice or Bob can move to the same column within the remaining rows. If they can, it's a draw; otherwise, Alice wins.

5. **Output:**
   - The function collects the results for each test case and prints them one by one.

### Correctness:

The program appears to correctly handle the conditions for determining the outcome of the game based on the given problem description. However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

- **Parity Check:**
  - The condition `if clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or (clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0)` can be simplified to `if (clues[2] - clues[4]) % 2 == 0`.
  - The logic for checking the absolute difference between `y_a` and `y_b` and the remaining rows is overly complex and can be simplified.

- **Simplified Logic:**
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `y_a == y_b`, Bob wins.
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `|y_a - y_b| > 1`, the game is a draw.
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have the same parity and `|y_a - y_b| == 1`, Bob wins if the remaining rows are sufficient for him to move to the same column; otherwise, it's a draw.
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities and `y_a == y_b`, Alice wins.
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities and `|y_a - y_b| > 1`, the game is a draw.
  - If `x_a` and `x_b` have different parities and `|y_a - y_b| == 1`, Alice wins if the remaining rows are sufficient for her to move to the same column; otherwise, it's a draw.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for i in range(test_cases):
        h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b = map(int, input().split())
        if x_a > x_b or h == 1:
            answers.append('Draw')
        elif (x_a - x_b) % 2 == 0:
            if y_a == y_b:
                answers.append('Bob')
            elif abs(y_a - y_b) > 1:
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        else:
            if y_a == y_b:
                answers.append('Alice')
            elif abs(y_a - y_b) > 1:
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Alice')
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
```

### Final Correctness:

Correctness: **False**

The original program has overly complex and incorrect logic for determining the outcome of the game. The corrected program simplifies the logic and correctly handles all the conditions as described in the problem.
