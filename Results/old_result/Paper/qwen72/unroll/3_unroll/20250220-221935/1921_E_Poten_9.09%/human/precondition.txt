t is a positive integer (1 \le t \le 10^4), h and w are positive integers (1 \le h \le 10^6, 1 \le w \le 10^9), x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h, 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w) representing the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips, and it is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b.
