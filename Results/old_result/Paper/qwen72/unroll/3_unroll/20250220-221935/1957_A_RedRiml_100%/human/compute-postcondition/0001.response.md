The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `w`. For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and is not used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100 representing the lengths of the sticks, `w` must be greater than 0**
