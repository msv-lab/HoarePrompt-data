Output State: **t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 100, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 100 for each test case, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100 representing the lengths of the sticks. w is an integer input by the user, and the loop has printed the number of shapes (sets of three sticks of the same length) for each of the w test cases.**
