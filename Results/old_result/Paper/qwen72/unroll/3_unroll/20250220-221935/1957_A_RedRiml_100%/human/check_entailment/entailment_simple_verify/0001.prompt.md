You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

            if i not in pl:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `w`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `ln` and the lengths of the sticks `palka`.

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Shape Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if the count `d[j]` is greater than or equal to 3.
   - If so, it calculates the number of regular polygons that can be formed with that stick length by performing integer division `d[j] // 3` and adds this to the `shapes` counter.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of shapes for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of Frequency Count**:
  - The dictionary `d` correctly counts the frequency of each stick length.
  - The list `pl` correctly stores unique stick lengths.

- **Correctness of Shape Calculation**:
  - The program assumes that a regular polygon can be formed if there are at least 3 sticks of the same length.
  - However, this assumption is not entirely correct. A regular polygon can have more than 3 sides (e.g., a square has 4 sides, a pentagon has 5 sides, etc.).
  - The program should check for the maximum number of sides that can be formed with the available sticks of the same length and then determine the number of polygons.

- **Example Test Cases**:
  - For the first test case with 1 stick of length 1, the program correctly outputs 0.
  - For the second test case with 2 sticks of length 1, the program correctly outputs 0.
  - For the third test case with 4 sticks of length 3, the program outputs 1, which is correct (a square can be formed).
  - For the fourth test case with 9 sticks (4 of length 2 and 5 of length 4), the program outputs 2, which is incorrect. It should output 2 (one pentagon with side length 2 and one square with side length 4).

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it only checks for the possibility of forming triangles (3-sided polygons) and does not consider polygons with more than 3 sides. Therefore, it fails to correctly determine the maximum number of regular polygons for some test cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
