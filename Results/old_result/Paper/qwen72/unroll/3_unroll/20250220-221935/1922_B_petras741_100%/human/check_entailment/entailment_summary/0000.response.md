### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `w`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `n` is less than 3, the function correctly prints 0 because it is impossible to form a triangle with fewer than 3 sticks.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function creates a list `q` to store the frequency of each stick length.
   - It iterates through the list `w` and increments the corresponding index in `q`.

4. **Unique Lengths Extraction:**
   - The function creates a list `eta` to store the unique stick lengths that have a non-zero frequency.
   - It iterates through `q` and appends the indices with non-zero values to `eta`.

5. **Triangle Formation Calculation:**
   - If there is only one unique stick length (`eta_ln == 1`), the function correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `n` sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \).
   - If there are multiple unique stick lengths, the function calculates the number of ways to form triangles by considering:
     - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length.
     - The number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length.

6. **Combination Formula:**
   - The combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} \) is correctly used to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length.
   - The formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \) is correctly used to calculate the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length.

7. **Summation:**
   - The function correctly accumulates the results for each unique stick length and prints the final result for each test case.

### Correctness:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic for counting the number of ways to form non-degenerate triangles with the given stick lengths. The combination formulas and the logic for handling unique stick lengths are appropriate and correctly applied.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:
