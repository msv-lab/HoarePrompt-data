### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of stick lengths `w`.

2. **Frequency Counting**: The function creates a frequency array `q` to count the occurrences of each stick length. This is done correctly by iterating over the list `w` and incrementing the corresponding index in `q`.

3. **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition**: The function then checks if `n` is at least 3, which is necessary to form a triangle. If `n` is less than 3, it correctly prints 0.

4. **Unique Stick Lengths**: The function creates a list `eta` to store the unique stick lengths that have a non-zero frequency. This is done by iterating over the frequency array `q` and appending the indices with non-zero values to `eta`.

5. **Single Unique Length Case**: If there is only one unique stick length (`eta_ln == 1`), the function calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using the combination formula \( \binom{q[eta[0]]}{3} \), which is \( \frac{q[eta[0]] \times (q[eta[0]] - 1) \times (q[eta[0]] - 2)}{6} \). This is correct.

6. **Multiple Unique Lengths Case**: If there are multiple unique stick lengths, the function calculates the number of ways to form a triangle by considering:
   - The number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length for each unique length.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length.

   The formula used for the second part is \( \frac{q[eta[j]] \times (q[eta[j]] - 1)}{2} \times \rho \), where `rho` is the cumulative sum of the frequencies of the previously considered stick lengths. This is also correct.

7. **Output**: The function prints the result for each test case, which is the total number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and constraints. It correctly counts the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle for each test case, considering the frequency of each stick length and the combination formulas.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Correctness: True**
