You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    6
    18
    98
    1
    750

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` from input, where `2 ≤ x ≤ 1000`, and prints the result of the integer division of `x` by 2. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the values of `x` and `y` are not retained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \(\gcd(a, b)\) is the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The given program sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \).
   - This means \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a divisor of \( x \) when \( x \) is even, and the largest integer less than \( x \) that is half of \( x \) when \( x \) is odd.

3. **Evaluating the Correctness**:
   - **Case 1: \( x \) is even**:
     - If \( x \) is even, \( x // 2 \) is an integer and \( \gcd(x, x // 2) = x // 2 \).
     - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = (x // 2) + (x // 2) = x \).
     - This is the maximum possible value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) because \( y \) is the largest possible integer less than \( x \) that is a divisor of \( x \).

   - **Case 2: \( x \) is odd**:
     - If \( x \) is odd, \( x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is half of \( x \).
     - \( \gcd(x, x // 2) \) is 1 because \( x \) is odd and \( x // 2 \) is an integer.
     - Therefore, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x // 2) \).
     - This is not necessarily the maximum possible value, but it is a valid value. For example, if \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \) gives \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \), which is not the maximum possible value (the maximum is 6 when \( y = 6 \)).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not always find the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for odd \( x \).
   - However, the problem statement allows for any \( y \) that satisfies the condition, and the program does provide a valid \( y \) in all cases.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not always find the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for odd \( x \), which is a requirement of the problem. For example, for \( x = 7 \), the maximum value of \( \gcd(7, y) + y \) is 6 when \( y = 6 \), but the program outputs \( y = 3 \), which gives a value of 4. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
