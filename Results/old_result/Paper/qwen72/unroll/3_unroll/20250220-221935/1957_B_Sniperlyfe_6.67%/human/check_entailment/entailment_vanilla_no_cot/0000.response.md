Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect due to its approach to distributing the bits across the sequence. The function `func_1` initializes all elements of the sequence with the maximum number of 1s that can fit within the bit length of `k`, then adjusts the last element to ensure the sum equals `k`. However, this approach does not guarantee that the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence is maximized.

### Issues:
1. **Bit Distribution**: The function assigns the same value to all elements in the sequence, which is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest number with all bits set to 1 within the bit length of `k`. However, this does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence.

2. **Sum Adjustment**: The function then adjusts the last element to make the sum equal to `k`. This can lead to a situation where the last element is much larger than the others, which might not be optimal for maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

### Correct Approach:
To maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence, you should distribute the bits as evenly as possible across the sequence. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(30):  # Assuming k <= 10^9, which fits in 30 bits
        if k & (1 << i):
            for j in range(n):
                if k >= (1 << i):
                    nums[j] |= (1 << i)
                    k -= (1 << i)
                else:
                    break
    return nums
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Approach:
- **Bitwise Distribution**: The function iterates over each bit position from 0 to 29 (since \( k \leq 10^9 \) fits within 30 bits).
- **Setting Bits**: For each bit position, if the bit is set in `k`, it distributes this bit to as many elements in the sequence as possible, ensuring that the sum remains equal to `k`.
- **Bitwise OR**: By distributing the bits as evenly as possible, the function maximizes the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence.

This approach ensures that the sequence satisfies both conditions: the sum equals `k` and the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR is maximized.
