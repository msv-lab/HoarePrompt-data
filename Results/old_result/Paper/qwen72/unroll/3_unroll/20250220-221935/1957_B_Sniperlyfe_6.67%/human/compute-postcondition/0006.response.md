Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` and returns a list `nums` of length `n`. Each element in the list, except the last one, is set to the value `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1`. The last element in the list is set to `(1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1 + k`. The function modifies the value of `k` during its execution, but the final state of `k` is not relevant to the user as it is not returned. **
