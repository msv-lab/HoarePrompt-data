The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the integers `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, a permutation `p` of length `n`, and an array `a` of length `n`. It then calculates two scores, `bm` and `sm`, based on the elements of `a` and the permutation `p`. After the calculations, it prints 'Bodya' if `bm` is greater than `sm`, 'Sasha' if `bm` is less than `sm`, or 'Draw' if they are equal. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results of the comparisons for each test case.
