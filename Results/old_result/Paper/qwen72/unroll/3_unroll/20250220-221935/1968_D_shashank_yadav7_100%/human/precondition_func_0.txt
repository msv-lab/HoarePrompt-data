t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers where 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. p is a permutation of length n, and a is an array of length n where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
