Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic of the game for every potential case. Specifically, the way the scores are updated and the moves are simulated is flawed. The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha using a loop that decrements `k` and updates the scores based on the current position and the remaining number of turns. This approach does not accurately simulate the game as described, where players can either stay at their current position or move to the position specified by the permutation.

A potential case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```
Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```
Actual Output:
```
Sasha
```
In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the scores and determines the wrong winner. The correct approach should simulate the game for exactly `k` turns, allowing each player to either stay or move to the position specified by the permutation, and then compare the final scores to determine the winner.
