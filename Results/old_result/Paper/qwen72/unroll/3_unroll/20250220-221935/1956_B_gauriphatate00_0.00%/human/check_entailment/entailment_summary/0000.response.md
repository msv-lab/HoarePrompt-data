### Reasoning:

The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can score in a card game where you and Nene each have `n` cards, and Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The key to solving this problem is to understand how to maximize your points given Nene's optimal play.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- **Input**: `n` (the number of cards each player has) and `a` (the list of integers on your cards).
- **Output**: The maximum number of points you can score.
- **Behavior**:
  - The function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
  - It calculates the number of pairs of integers in `a` (i.e., integers that appear exactly twice).
  - It returns the minimum value between the number of pairs and `n // 2`.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- **Input**: Multiple test cases from `stdin`.
- **Output**: The results of `func_1` for each test case, printed to `stdout`.
- **Behavior**:
  - It reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - It prints the results of `func_1` for each test case.

### Analysis:
1. **Function 1**:
   - The function correctly identifies the number of pairs of integers in your hand.
   - The return value `min(pairs, n // 2)` is correct because:
     - `pairs` represents the number of integers that appear exactly twice in your hand.
     - `n // 2` represents the maximum number of pairs you can play, given that you have `n` cards and each turn involves playing one card.
   - If you have more pairs than `n // 2`, you can only play `n // 2` pairs, and each pair will give you 1 point. If you have fewer pairs, you can play all of them.

2. **Function 2**:
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters for each test case.
   - It prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, which is the correct behavior for the problem.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the card game.
- The input and output handling in `func_2` is appropriate for the problem's requirements.
- The logic in `func_1` is sound and aligns with the problem's constraints and expected behavior.

### Correctness:
**True**
