Output State: The variable `t` remains the same as its initial value. The variable `idx` is now `1 + t + sum(n for n in map(int, data[1:1+t]))`, where `t` is the number of test cases and each `n` represents the number of elements in each test case. The variable `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each test case, where `n` is the number of elements in the test case and `a` is the list of those elements. The loop has printed each element in the `results` list, but the `results` list itself remains unchanged. No other variables are affected.
