### Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves 2n cards, with each integer from 1 to n appearing exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed such that each player gets n cards.
   - The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can score, given that Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Analyzing the Strategy:**
   - You and Nene take turns, and each turn involves placing one card on the table.
   - If a card with the same integer is already on the table, the player scores a point.
   - Nene plays optimally, meaning she will always try to score a point if possible and, if not, will try to prevent you from scoring a point in the future.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The maximum number of points you can score is determined by the number of pairs of cards you have in your hand.
   - If you have a pair of cards with the same integer, you can score a point for one of them (the first one you play will not score a point, but the second one will if Nene hasn't played the matching card yet).
   - Nene will always play optimally, so she will try to score points for herself and prevent you from scoring points.

4. **Function 1 Analysis:**
   - `func_1(n, a)` calculates the number of pairs of cards in your hand.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in your hand.
   - It then sums the number of integers that appear exactly twice (i.e., pairs).
   - The function returns the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` because you can only score points for up to half of the total number of turns you have.

5. **Function 2 Analysis:**
   - `func_2()` reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the list of integers `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1(n, a)` to compute the maximum number of points you can score for each test case and appends the result to a list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

6. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of pairs in your hand.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The output format matches the problem description, printing the result for each test case.

7. **Validation with Annotated Code:**
   - The annotations confirm that the state of the program is correctly managed throughout the execution.
   - The `Counter` is used appropriately to count the occurrences of each integer.
   - The `min(pairs, n // 2)` calculation ensures that the number of points you can score is limited by the number of pairs you have and the number of turns you have.
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` is correct, ensuring that the program processes multiple test cases as expected.

### Conclusion
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can score in the card game, given that Nene plays optimally. The annotations and the original assessment align with the correct behavior of the program. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
