### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `kreker`, using `int(input())`.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `kreker` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1()`, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`.

3. **Logic for Determining Possibility**:
   - The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves `n` and the desired number of cubes `m` is even. This is necessary because each move can either add or remove one cube, and the parity (odd or even nature) of the number of moves must match the parity of the number of cubes added or removed.
   - The condition `n - m >= 0` ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`, which is necessary because you cannot have a negative number of moves to achieve a positive number of cubes.

4. **Output**:
   - If both conditions are satisfied, the program prints "Yes".
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Analysis:
- The logic is correct because:
  - If `n - m` is even and non-negative, it means that the number of moves can be split into an equal number of additions and removals (or all additions) to achieve exactly `m` cubes.
  - If `n - m` is odd or negative, it is impossible to achieve exactly `m` cubes with `n` moves.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
