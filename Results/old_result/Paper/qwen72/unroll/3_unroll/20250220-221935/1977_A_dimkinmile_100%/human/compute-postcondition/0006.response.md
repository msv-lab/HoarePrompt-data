The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `m`. `t` is the number of test cases and is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n`, and `m`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
