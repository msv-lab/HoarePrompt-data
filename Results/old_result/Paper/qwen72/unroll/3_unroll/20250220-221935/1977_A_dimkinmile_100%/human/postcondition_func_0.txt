The function `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `m` from the user input, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`. It checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the input values `n` and `m` have been processed and the appropriate message has been printed based on the conditions.
