Based on the initial state provided:

- The function takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
- The function should handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are assigned values from a space-separated string of two integers.
- Additionally, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.

Given the print statement:
```
print('No')
```

The print statement does not depend on any variables or conditions. It simply prints the string `'No'`.

Therefore, the output will be:
Output: **No**
