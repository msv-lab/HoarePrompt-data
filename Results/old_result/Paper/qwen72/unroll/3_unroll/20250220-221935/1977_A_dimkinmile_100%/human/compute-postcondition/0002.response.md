Based on the initial state provided:

- The function takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
- The function can handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.
- `n` and `m` are assigned values from a space-separated string of two integers.
- The difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative, meaning `n - m` is even and `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

Given these conditions, the `print` statement in the code snippet is:

```python
print('Yes')
```

This statement will always print the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `n` and `m`, as long as the precondition is satisfied. The precondition ensures that `n - m` is even and non-negative, which means the conditions for the function to print 'Yes' are always met.

Output: **Yes**
