Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the string is a tandem repeat but contains question marks that are not necessary to change to maintain the tandem repeat property. For example, consider the input string "a?a". The correct output should be 2 because "a?a" can be replaced to form "aaa", and "aa" is a tandem repeat. However, the program will output 0 because it does not correctly identify that the question mark can be replaced to form a valid tandem repeat.
