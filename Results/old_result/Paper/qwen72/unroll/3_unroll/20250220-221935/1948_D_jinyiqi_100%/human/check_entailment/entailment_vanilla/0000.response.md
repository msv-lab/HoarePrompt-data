### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function reads the string `s` and converts it to a list of characters.
   - It calculates the length of the string `n`.

3. **Tandem Repeat Check**:
   - The program iterates over possible lengths of the first half of the tandem repeat, starting from the largest possible half-length (`n // 2`) down to 1.
   - For each half-length `j`, it checks if there is a substring of length `2*j` that can be a tandem repeat by comparing characters in the first half with the corresponding characters in the second half.
   - If either character is a question mark or the characters are equal, it increments the `count`.
   - If the characters are not equal and neither is a question mark, it resets the `count` to 0.
   - If `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2*j` has been found, and the program prints `count * 2` and returns.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If no tandem repeat is found for any half-length, the program prints `0`.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the longest possible tandem repeat by checking from the largest possible half-length down to the smallest.
   - The use of `count` ensures that the program only prints the length of a valid tandem repeat when it is found.
   - The program handles question marks by considering them as wildcards that can match any character, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case, either the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat or `0` if no tandem repeat can be formed.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat after replacing question marks with lowercase Latin letters. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

### Correctness:
**True**
