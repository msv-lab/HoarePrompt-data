Output State: **The loop may print an integer value that is twice the length of the longest substring of `s` which can be repeated consecutively, and then the function returns. If no such substring is found, the loop completes its execution without printing anything, and the function returns without further output. The values of `s`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.**
