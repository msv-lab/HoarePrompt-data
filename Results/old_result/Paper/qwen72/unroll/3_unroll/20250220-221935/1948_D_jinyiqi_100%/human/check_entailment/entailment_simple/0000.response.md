Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. However, it calls `func_1()` without passing the string `s` as an argument, which is a mistake. The function `func_1` should be called with the string `s` as an argument.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters, which means it does not receive the string `s` from the main loop. Instead, it reads the input directly inside the function, which is not ideal but does not affect the correctness of the solution for the given problem.

3. **Tandem Repeat Check**: The function `func_1` correctly checks for the longest possible tandem repeat by iterating over possible lengths `j` from the largest possible half-length down to 1. For each length `j`, it checks if the substring from `k` to `k + j` can be part of a tandem repeat by comparing characters and handling question marks.

4. **Counting and Printing**: The program correctly increments the `count` when a potential tandem repeat is found and resets it otherwise. If a tandem repeat of length `j` is found, it prints `count * 2` and returns immediately, which is correct. If no tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the string contains only question marks or when no tandem repeat can be formed.

However, the main issue is that the function `func_1` should be called with the string `s` as an argument to make the program more modular and maintainable. The current implementation reads the input directly inside the function, which is not a good practice but does not affect the correctness of the solution for the given problem.

Given the above reasoning, the program is logically correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and inputs.

Correctness: **True**
