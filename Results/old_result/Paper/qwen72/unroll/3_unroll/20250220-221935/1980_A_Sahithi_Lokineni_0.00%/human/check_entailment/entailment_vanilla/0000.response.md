Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case in a loop. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`, followed by the string `s` representing the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Frequencies**: The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`. This is a good approach to keep track of how many problems of each difficulty level are available.

3. **Calculating Required Problems**: The program then calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level. It does this by iterating over the keys in the dictionary `d` and checking if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`. If it is, it adds the difference `m - d[val]` to the answer `ans`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

However, there is a critical issue in the program:

- **Default Value for defaultdict**: The `defaultdict` is initialized with a function `default_value`, but this function is not defined in the program. Instead, the program defines a function `func_1` that returns `0`, but it is not used to initialize the `defaultdict`.

To fix this, the `defaultdict` should be initialized with `func_1` or a lambda function that returns `0`.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(lambda: 0)  # Corrected initialization
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:  # Use < instead of <= to correctly calculate the deficit
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Initialization**: `defaultdict(lambda: 0)` ensures that any new key in the dictionary will have a default value of `0`.
- **Comparison**: The condition `if d[val] < m` is used instead of `if d[val] <= m` to correctly calculate the number of additional problems needed. If `d[val]` is exactly `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.

### Correctness:
Given the above reasoning and the necessary fix, the corrected program is correct. Therefore, the original program is incorrect due to the missing default value function and the incorrect comparison.

Correctness: **False**
