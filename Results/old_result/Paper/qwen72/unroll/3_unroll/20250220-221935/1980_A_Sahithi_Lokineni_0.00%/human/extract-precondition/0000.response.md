Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000), a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5), and a list of strings a, each of length n and composed of characters 'A' to 'G'. The length of the list of tuples and the list of strings a should be equal to t.**

Note: The function definition provided in the problem statement is incomplete. It should be updated to match the parameters described in the precondition. Here is the corrected function definition:

```python
def func_1(t, rounds, problems):
```

Where:
- `t` is the number of test cases.
- `rounds` is a list of tuples, each containing two integers `n` and `m`.
- `problems` is a list of strings, each representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank for each test case.
