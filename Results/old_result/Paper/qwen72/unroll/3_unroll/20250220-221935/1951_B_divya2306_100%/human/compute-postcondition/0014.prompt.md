You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: `n` and `k`, where `n` is the number of cows (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and `k` is the index of your cow (1 ≤ k ≤ n). Additionally, it should take a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. The function should be able to handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) provided as input. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    wins = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        wins += 1
        
    #State: `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element exists. `n`, `k`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    if (wins >= k) :
        print(wins - 1)
        #This is printed: wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element exists, and wins is greater than or equal to `k`)
        return
        #The program returns `wins`, which is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element exists, and `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    #State: `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element exists. `n`, `k`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged. `wins` is less than `k`.
    win_with_swap = wins + 1
    for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
        if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
            break
        
        win_with_swap += 1
        
    #State: `win_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` from `wins` to `k-1`, or `k` if no such element exists. `wins` remains unchanged. `n`, `k`, `a`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))
    #This is printed: max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins if wins != 0 else win_with_swap - 1) (where `wins` is the value of `wins`, and `win_with_swap` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` from `wins` to `k-1`, or `k` if no such element exists)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is the number of cows, `k` is the index of your cow, and `a` is a list of distinct Cowdeforces ratings. It returns the number of cows with ratings less than or equal to your cow's rating before encountering a cow with a higher rating, or `n` if no higher-rated cow is found, provided that this number is at least `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `wins`, which is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` before the first element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element exists, and `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
