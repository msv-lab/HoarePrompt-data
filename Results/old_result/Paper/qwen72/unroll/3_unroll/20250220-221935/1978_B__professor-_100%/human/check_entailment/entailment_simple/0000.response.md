Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each.

2. **Base Case (b <= a)**: If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, the optimal strategy is to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. This is because selling at the modified price would not yield more profit than selling at the usual price. The program correctly outputs `n * a` in this case.

3. **Modified Price Advantage (b - a >= n)**: If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can maximize his profit by selling all buns at the modified price. The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time. The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of such a series is `n * (2 * b - n + 1) // 2`. The program correctly calculates and outputs this profit.

4. **Mixed Strategy (b - a < n)**: If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price. The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of the arithmetic series starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each time, which is `(b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2`. The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is `a * (n - (b - a))`. The program correctly calculates and outputs this profit.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated profit for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

6. **State After Loop**: The program correctly iterates through all test cases and prints the results. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are unchanged after each iteration, as they are local to the loop.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to handle all cases correctly and follows the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
