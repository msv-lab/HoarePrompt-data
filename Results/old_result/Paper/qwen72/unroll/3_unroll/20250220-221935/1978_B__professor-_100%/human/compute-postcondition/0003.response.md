The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters in its signature, but based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should accept parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output based on the input parameters is not provided in the example.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the exact nature of the result is not specified.**
