Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it prints `2` whenever it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and it prints `3` in all other cases. However, this logic is flawed because it does not always find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3
2
```

Actual Output:
```
2
3
2
```

The program correctly outputs `2` for the first and third test cases, but it fails for the second test case. The second test case has a cycle of length 4 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), and the program incorrectly outputs `3` instead of `2`. The correct minimum number of invitations for this case is `2` because Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party since their best friends (2 and 3, respectively) also receive invitations.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should identify the smallest cycle or pair of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The current logic does not handle cycles of length greater than 2 correctly.
