You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program: 
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem with multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` representing the number of friends (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct). The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. If there is any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, it prints `2` and sets `flag` to `True`. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The variables `n`, `x`, and `l` are updated in each iteration, but the final state of `n` remains the same as the initial state, and `flag` is set to `True` if the condition was met in any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. If there is any index `i` in the list `l` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it prints `3`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The final state of the program includes the variables `n`, `x`, and `l` being updated for each iteration, but `n` retains its initial value after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it prints `2` whenever it finds a pair of friends who are each other's best friends, and it prints `3` in all other cases. However, this logic is flawed because it does not always find the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

**Counterexample:**

Input:
```
3
5
3 1 2 5 4
4
2 3 4 1
2
2 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
3
2
```

Actual Output:
```
2
3
2
```

The program correctly outputs `2` for the first and third test cases, but it fails for the second test case. The second test case has a cycle of length 4 (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), and the program incorrectly outputs `3` instead of `2`. The correct minimum number of invitations for this case is `2` because Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1 and 2, and both will come to the party since their best friends (2 and 3, respectively) also receive invitations.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should identify the smallest cycle or pair of friends that can be invited to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The current logic does not handle cycles of length greater than 2 correctly.
