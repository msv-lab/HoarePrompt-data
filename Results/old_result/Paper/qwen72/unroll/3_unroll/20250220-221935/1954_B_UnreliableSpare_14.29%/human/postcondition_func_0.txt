The function `func_1` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered. The function does not modify the input variables `n` or `arr`.
