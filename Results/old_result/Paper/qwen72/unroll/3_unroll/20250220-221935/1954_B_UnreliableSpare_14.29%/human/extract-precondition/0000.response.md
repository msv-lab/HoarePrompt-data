Precondition: **The function should accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
