### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arr`.

2. **Checking if All Elements are the Same**:
   - The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by iterating through the array and setting a `flag` to `False` if any two consecutive elements are different.
   - If all elements are the same, the program prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')` to ensure it starts with a value that can be minimized.
   - It then iterates through the array to count the number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element `val`.
   - For each segment of consecutive elements equal to `val`, it updates `ans` with the minimum count of such elements.
   - Finally, it prints `ans` if the array is not all the same, which represents the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
- **Use of `Decimal`**:
  - The use of `Decimal('Infinity')` is unnecessary and can be replaced with a simpler `float('inf')` or a large integer like `10**9` to represent infinity.
  - This does not affect the correctness of the program but is not a common practice for this type of problem.

- **Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove**:
  - The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only considers segments of consecutive elements equal to the first element `val` and updates `ans` with the minimum count of such segments.
  - This approach does not correctly handle the problem of making the array non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. It should consider the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the array being beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
- To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that there is no index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1) such that `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`.
- One way to achieve this is to find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of the array being beautiful. This can be done by:
  - Counting the number of elements that are part of the pattern.
  - Removing the minimum number of elements to break the pattern.

### Correctness:
- The current program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It only considers segments of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not sufficient.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
