You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The function should also handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The value of `flag` will be `False` if any two consecutive elements in the list `arr` are different. Otherwise, `flag` will remain `True`. The values of `n` and `arr` will remain unchanged.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: `flag` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` at the end of the list or before a different element is encountered.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered or the value of `cnt`, whichever is smaller.
        #
        #Output:
    #State: *`flag` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `arr` remains unchanged, `ans` is the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` before a different element is encountered or the value of `cnt`, whichever is smaller, `val` is the first element of `arr`, and `cnt` is the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element of `arr` at the end of the list or before a different element is encountered.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, and the list `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The function handles up to 10^4 test cases, with the sum of `n` over all test cases not exceeding 3 · 10^5. It returns the result of processing each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
