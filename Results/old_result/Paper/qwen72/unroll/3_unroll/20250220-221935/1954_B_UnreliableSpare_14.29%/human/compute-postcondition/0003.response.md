The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. The variable `i` should start at 1, as specified by the range.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `flag` is True, `arr` is a list of integers provided by the user, `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
