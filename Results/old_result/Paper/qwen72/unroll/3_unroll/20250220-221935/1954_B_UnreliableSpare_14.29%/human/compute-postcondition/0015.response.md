The function `func_1` accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The integer `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The list `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful. The function should handle up to 10^4 test cases, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function returns the result of processing each test case.
