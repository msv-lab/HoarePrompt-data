The only variables in the loop head are the loop variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop executes, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly used in the loop body, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, for the loop to execute at least once, the input must be a positive integer.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
