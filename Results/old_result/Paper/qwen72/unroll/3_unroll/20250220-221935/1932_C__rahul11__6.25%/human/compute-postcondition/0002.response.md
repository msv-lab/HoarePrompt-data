Output State: **For each test case, the loop computes a list `res` of length `n` where `res[0]` is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`. For each subsequent index `k` in `res`, if `s[k-1]` is 'L', `res[k]` is the product of the remaining elements in `arr` from the left side (excluding the first `k` elements) modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`. If `s[k-1]` is 'R', `res[k]` is the product of the remaining elements in `arr` from the right side (excluding the last `k` elements) modulo `m` and then modulo `MOD`. The loop then prints the list `res` for each test case.**
