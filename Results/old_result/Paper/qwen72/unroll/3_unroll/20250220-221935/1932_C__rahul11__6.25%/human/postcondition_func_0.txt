The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers `n` and `m`, a list `arr` of `n` integers, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `res` of length `n` where `res[0]` is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. For each subsequent index `k` in `res`, if `s[k-1]` is 'L', `res[k]` is the product of the remaining elements in `arr` from the left side (excluding the first `k` elements) modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. If `s[k-1]` is 'R', `res[k]` is the product of the remaining elements in `arr` from the right side (excluding the last `k` elements) modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. The function prints the list `res` for each test case.
