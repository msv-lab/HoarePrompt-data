Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Single Character String Handling**: The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". This is correct.

2. **Strings with All Characters the Same**: The program correctly identifies that a string where all characters are the same (e.g., "lllllllll") cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO". This is correct.

3. **Strings with One Different Character**: The program attempts to handle strings where all but one character are the same (e.g., "lllllllll"). However, it incorrectly prints "NO" for some cases where a valid partition exists. For example, for the string "abaaa", the program should print "YES" and a valid partition, but it incorrectly prints "NO".

4. **General Case Handling**: The program's logic for handling general cases is overly complex and does not always produce the correct output. For example, for the string "uwuowouwu", the program should print "YES" and a valid partition, but it may not always do so correctly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that should handle all cases correctly:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if n == 2:
            if string[0] == string[1]:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
                print(1)
                print(string)
            continue
        
        if is_palindrome(string):
            # Check if we can split the string into two parts where at least one part is not a palindrome
            for i in range(1, n):
                if not is_palindrome(string[:i]) or not is_palindrome(string[i:]):
                    print('YES')
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:i], string[i:])
                    break
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Single Character String**: If the string has only one character, it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, so we print "NO".
2. **Two Character String**: If the string has two characters, we check if they are the same. If they are, it is a palindrome and we print "NO". Otherwise, it is not a palindrome and we print "YES" with the string itself as the partition.
3. **General Case**:
   - If the string is a palindrome, we attempt to split it into two parts such that at least one part is not a palindrome. We iterate through possible split points and check if either part is not a palindrome. If we find such a split, we print "YES" and the partition.
   - If the string is not a palindrome, we can simply print "YES" with the string itself as the partition.

This corrected program should handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
