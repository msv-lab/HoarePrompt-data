Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum number of points you can get, but it does not account for the optimal play by Nene, who will always try to maximize her score and minimize yours.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
1 2 3
```
In this case, you have cards with numbers 1, 2, and 3, and Nene has the other set of cards with numbers 1, 2, and 3. The optimal play for you would be to score 0 points, as Nene will always play the matching card after you, ensuring that you never get a point. However, the program will incorrectly calculate a non-zero score because it does not simulate the game correctly, especially the part where Nene plays optimally.

The program's logic for updating the DP table is flawed, as it does not consider the optimal moves by Nene in a turn-based game. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
