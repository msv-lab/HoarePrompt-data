The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads input from the user. It expects the first input to be an integer `n` representing the number of cards each player receives, and the second input to be a list of integers `cards` representing the cards in your hand. The function then computes a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is determined based on the presence and count of `j + 1` in the `cards` list. The function returns the value of `dp[0][0]`, which represents the optimal score or outcome based on the dynamic programming computation. The `cards` list and the integer `n` remain unchanged after the function execution.
