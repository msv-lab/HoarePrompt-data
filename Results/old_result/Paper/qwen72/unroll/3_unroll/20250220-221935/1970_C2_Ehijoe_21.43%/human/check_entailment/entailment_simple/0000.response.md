### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction:**
   - The program correctly parses the input to get the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is always 1).
   - It then reads the edges and constructs the adjacency list `nodes` using a `defaultdict` of lists. This is a correct and efficient way to represent the tree.

2. **Leaf Nodes Identification:**
   - The program identifies the leaf nodes (nodes with only one neighbor) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. This step is not necessary for the final solution but does not affect the correctness of the program.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree, excluding the parent node. This is done recursively.
   - The base case correctly identifies a leaf node (a node with only one neighbor, which is the parent node) and returns a list containing 0.
   - For non-leaf nodes, the function recursively calculates the distances to all its children and increments them by 1. This is a correct approach to calculate the distances in a tree.

4. **Game Logic:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the starting node for the round and calls `func_1` to get the distances from the starting node to all other nodes.
   - The program then checks if any of the distances is odd. If at least one distance is odd, Ron wins the round because he can always make the first move and force Hermione into a position where she has to make an even move, which will eventually lead to a loss for Hermione.
   - If all distances are even, Hermione wins because she can always mirror Ron's moves, ensuring that she will always have a valid move after Ron.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly prints "Ron" if any distance is odd and "Hermione" if all distances are even.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given problem description and constraints. The functions and the overall flow of the program are logically sound and handle the input and output as expected.

### Correctness:
**True**
