### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.

2. **Array Processing:**
   - The program appends a `-1` to the end of the array `nums` to handle edge cases. This is a good practice to ensure that the last segment is processed correctly.
   - It iterates through the array to group consecutive identical elements into a list of tuples `arr`. Each tuple contains the start index, end index, and the value of the group. This step is intended to help quickly find the boundaries of different elements in the array.
   - The list `arr` is constructed correctly, and it helps in efficiently finding the segments.

3. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the first group that starts at or after the query's left boundary `l`.
   - It then checks if the start of the group is greater than `l` and if the end of the group is less than `r`.
   - If the start of the group is greater than `l`, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous group and the first element of the current group. This is correct because it ensures that the two indices are within the range `[l, r]` and have different values.
   - If the end of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no different elements exist in the range. This is correct because if the end of the group is greater than or equal to `r`, it means the entire range `[l, r]` is covered by a single segment of the same value.
   - If the end of the group is less than `r`, it prints the indices of the first element of the current group and the first element of the next group. This is correct because it ensures that the two indices are within the range `[l, r]` and have different values.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program includes a debug print statement for `ppp == 23`, which is not necessary for the problem and can be ignored.
   - The program also includes a condition `if tc > 5` to skip some queries, which is not part of the problem requirements and can lead to incorrect results. This is a significant logical error.

5. **Logical Errors:**
   - The condition `if tc > 5` is a logical error because it skips some queries without processing them, leading to incorrect output.
   - The program does not handle the case where the range `l` to `r` contains only one unique element correctly. Specifically, the condition `if s > l` and `if e >= r` need to be carefully evaluated to ensure that the range is checked for different elements.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the logical error in the query handling (skipping queries with `if tc > 5`) and the potential issue with handling ranges that contain only one unique element, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
