The function `func_1` is not defined with any parameters, but based on the problem description, it should take a list of integers `a` and a list of queries, where each query is a pair of integers `(l, r)`. The list `a` contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each element `a_i` is an integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). The list of queries contains `q` queries (1 ≤ q ≤ 2 · 10^5), and each query `(l, r)` satisfies 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. The function should be called multiple times for different test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
