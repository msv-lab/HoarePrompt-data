Reasoning:

The program is designed to find the minimum cost for buying exactly `n` yogurts given two pricing options: buying one yogurt for `a` burles or buying two yogurts for `b` burles. The logic of the program is as follows:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 != 0`)**:
   - If the cost of two individual yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the individual price. The total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotional price and then buy one additional yogurt at the individual price. The total cost is `(n // 2) * b + a`.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts (`n % 2 == 0`)**:
   - If the cost of two individual yogurts (`2 * a`) is less than the promotional price (`b`), then it is cheaper to buy all yogurts at the individual price. The total cost is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price. The total cost is `(n // 2) * b`.

The program correctly handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts and calculates the minimum cost based on the given conditions. Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- For `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 9`.
  - The program should print `a * n = 5 * 2 = 10`, but it prints `9` because `2 * a` is not less than `b`.
  - Correct output: `9`.

- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`:
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - The program should print `(n // 2) * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Correct output: `14`.

- For `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
  - `n` is odd.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program should print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
  - Correct output: `15`.

- For `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`:
  - `n` is even.
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - The program should print `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
  - Correct output: `20`.

The program correctly handles all the test cases provided in the example and follows the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
