You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30) from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions: If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts.
   - The cost of one yogurt is `a` burles.
   - The cost of two yogurts is `b` burles.
   - We need to consider whether it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - The output should be the minimum cost for each test case.

3. **Logic of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It checks if `n` is odd or even:
     - If `n` is odd:
       - It compares the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) with the promotion price (`b`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost of buying all yogurts individually (`a * n`).
       - Otherwise, it prints the cost of buying as many pairs as possible at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price (`n // 2 * b + a`).
     - If `n` is even:
       - It again compares the cost of buying two yogurts individually (`2 * a`) with the promotion price (`b`).
       - If `2 * a < b`, it prints the total cost of buying all yogurts individually (`a * n`).
       - Otherwise, it prints the cost of buying all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (`n // 2 * b`).

4. **Verification:**
   - **Test Case 1:**
     - `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `n` is even.
     - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
     - The program should print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
     - Output: `9` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 2:**
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
     - `n` is odd.
     - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
     - The program should print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
     - Output: `14` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 3:**
     - `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `n` is odd.
     - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
     - The program should print `a * n = 3 * 5 = 15`.
     - Output: `15` (Correct)
   - **Test Case 4:**
     - `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
     - `n` is even.
     - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
     - The program should print `a * n = 4 * 5 = 20`.
     - Output: `20` (Correct)

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles both even and odd values of `n` correctly.
   - It correctly compares the cost of buying two yogurts individually with the promotion price.
   - It calculates the minimum cost based on the comparison and the parity of `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for buying `n` yogurts based on the given problem description and constraints. It handles all the provided test cases and edge cases correctly.
