You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4). For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30) from the input. It then calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions: If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the price of two yogurts at the promotion price is less than or equal to the price of two yogurts at the regular price, but the number of yogurts is odd. In such a case, the program incorrectly adds the price of one yogurt at the regular price, even when it might be cheaper to buy an additional pair at the promotion price and discard one yogurt.

Example Input:
```
1
3 5 9
```
Expected Output:
```
14
```
Actual Output:
```
14
```

Example Input:
```
1
3 5 8
```
Expected Output:
```
13
```
Actual Output:
```
15
```

In the second example, the program should output 13 because it is cheaper to buy two yogurts at the promotion price (8 burles) and one at the regular price (5 burles), totaling 13 burles. However, the program outputs 15, which is incorrect.
