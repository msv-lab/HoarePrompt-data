Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition strings that contain a mix of characters but still form palindromic substrings when certain characters are removed or rearranged. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
3
abcba
abccba
abacaba
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NO
NO
YES
3
aba c ab
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
NO
NO
```

In the third test case, the string "abacaba" can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, but the program incorrectly outputs "NO". This indicates that the program does not correctly identify all valid partitions for strings that are not entirely composed of the same character but still contain palindromic substrings.
