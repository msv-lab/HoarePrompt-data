The function `func` should be modified to accept two parameters: an integer `t` and a list of strings `s_list`. The integer `t` represents the number of test cases, and each string `s` in `s_list` consists of lowercase Latin characters. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a string in `s_list` and is determined based on some processing of the string. The sum of the lengths of all strings in `s_list` does not exceed 10^6.
