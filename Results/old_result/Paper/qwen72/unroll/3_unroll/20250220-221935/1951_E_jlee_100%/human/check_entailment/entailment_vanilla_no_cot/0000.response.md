Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description:

1. **Handling of Single Character Strings:**
   - The program correctly identifies that a single character string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO" for such cases.

2. **Handling of Strings with All Characters the Same:**
   - The program correctly identifies that a string with all characters the same (e.g., "lllllllll") cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints "NO" for such cases.

3. **Handling of Strings with One Different Character:**
   - The program correctly identifies that a string with one different character (e.g., "abaaa") can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings if the different character is not in the middle. However, it fails to handle cases where the different character is in the middle (e.g., "ababa").

4. **General Case:**
   - The program attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings by checking for the first non-matching character and then further checking for the second non-matching character. However, the logic is overly complex and does not always produce the correct partition.
   - For example, the program fails to correctly partition the string "uwuowouwu" into non-palindromic substrings. It should be able to partition it into "uw uow ouwu" or any other valid partition, but it does not.

### Correct Approach:
A simpler and more reliable approach to solve this problem is to check if the string can be partitioned into two or more non-palindromic substrings. Here is a more straightforward solution:

1. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string has only one character, print "NO".

2. **All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same, print "NO".

3. **General Case:**
   - If the string has at least two different characters, it can always be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. For example, if the string is "ababa", you can partition it into "a" and "baba" or "ab" and "aba".
   - If the string has more than two different characters, it can be partitioned into "YES" with a simple partition like "a" and the rest of the string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if len(set(string)) == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(string[0], string[1:])

func()
```

This program correctly handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides a valid partition when possible.
