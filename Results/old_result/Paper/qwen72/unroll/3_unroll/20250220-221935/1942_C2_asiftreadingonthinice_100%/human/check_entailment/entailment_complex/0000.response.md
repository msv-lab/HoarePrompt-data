### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it reads input from the standard input. This is a valid approach for handling input in a competitive programming context.
   - The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is read from the input. This is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the function reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, which are the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, respectively.
   - The function then reads a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen and sorts this list.

3. **Initial Triangle Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is a reasonable starting point because each vertex chosen by Bessie and you can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices.
   - The function then iterates through the sorted list of vertices to find gaps between consecutive vertices. If the gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans` because a triangle can be formed by adding a vertex in the middle of the gap.
   - If the gap is even, it adds the gap divided by 2 to a temporary list `tmp` for further processing.

4. **Handling the Wrap-Around Gap:**
   - The function also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list, considering the wrap-around nature of the polygon. If this gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans`. If the gap is even, it adds the gap divided by 2 to `tmp`.

5. **Optimizing the Number of Triangles:**
   - The function sorts the `tmp` list, which contains the potential additional triangles that can be formed by adding vertices.
   - It then iterates through `tmp` and adds the number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices, ensuring that the number of additional vertices chosen does not exceed `y`.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum of the calculated number of triangles `ans` and `n - 2`. This is because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly handles the input and processes each test case as described.
- The logic for calculating the number of triangles and optimizing the additional vertices is sound and follows the constraints and requirements of the problem.
- The final output ensures that the number of triangles does not exceed the maximum possible number of non-intersecting triangles in the polygon.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.
