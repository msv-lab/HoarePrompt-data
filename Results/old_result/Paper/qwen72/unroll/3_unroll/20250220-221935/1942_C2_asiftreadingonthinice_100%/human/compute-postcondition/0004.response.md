Functionality: ** The function `max_triangles` processes a series of test cases to determine the maximum number of triangles that can be formed by adding vertices to an existing set of vertices chosen by Bessie. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. For each test case, the function calculates the number of triangles that can be formed and prints the minimum of this calculated number and `n - 2`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The state of the program outside the function remains unchanged. **
