The function `max_triangles` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. Each test case must satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple contains integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. The function returns the maximum number of triangles that can be formed for each test case.**
