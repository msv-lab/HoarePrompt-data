Reasoning:

The program is intended to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78). The program reads the number of test cases and then, for each test case, reads an integer `lex` and attempts to construct the smallest word by distributing the value of `lex` among three letters.

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:

1. **Incorrect Distribution of Values**:
   - The program uses a loop to distribute the value of `lex` among the first two letters. It checks if `lex` is less than or equal to 26, less than 52, or greater than or equal to 52. This logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly handle the distribution of values to ensure the smallest lexicographical order.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, the program will append 1 to `arr` twice and then append 22, resulting in `[1, 1, 22]`. This is not the correct way to find the smallest lexicographical word, which should be "aav" (1 + 1 + 22).

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - After distributing the values, the program sorts the array `arr`. Sorting is not necessary because the goal is to find the smallest lexicographical word, which means the letters should be as small as possible from left to right.

3. **Handling the Last Letter**:
   - The program appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr` after the loop, but this value might not be correctly calculated due to the flawed distribution logic.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, you should start by assigning the smallest possible values to the first two letters and then assign the remaining value to the third letter.
   - For example, if `lex` is 24, you should assign 1 to the first letter, 1 to the second letter, and 22 to the third letter, resulting in "aav".

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
