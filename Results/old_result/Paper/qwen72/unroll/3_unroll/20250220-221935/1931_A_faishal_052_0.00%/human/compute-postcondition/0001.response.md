The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `cases`. If `cases` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `n` (where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78) does not directly affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, `cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
