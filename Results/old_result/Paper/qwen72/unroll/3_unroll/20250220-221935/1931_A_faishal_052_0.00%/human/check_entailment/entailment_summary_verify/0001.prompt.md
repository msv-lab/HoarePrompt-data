You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        lex = int(input())
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(1)
                lex = lex - 1
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        arr.append(lex)
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) representing the encoded value of a three-letter word. It then decodes this value into a three-character string, where each character is determined by the sorted values in an array `arr` plus 96. The function prints the decoded three-character string for each test case. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually by reading the encoded value `lex`.

2. **Array Initialization**: The program initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters that will form the lexicographically smallest word.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program attempts to decode the encoded value `lex` into three positions by iterating over a loop twice (for the first two positions).
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the smallest possible value that fits within the remaining `lex` and subtract that value from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it does not consider the smallest possible value.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is incorrect for the same reason as above.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

4. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts the list `arr` to ensure the positions are in ascending order.
   - It then prints the corresponding characters by converting the positions to ASCII values (using `chr(arr[k] + 96)`).

5. **Issues**:
   - The decoding logic is flawed. It does not correctly handle the distribution of the values to form the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The program should prioritize assigning the smallest possible values to the first two positions and then the remaining value to the third position.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To form the lexicographically smallest word, the program should:
     - Assign the smallest possible value (1) to the first position.
     - Assign the smallest possible value to the second position, ensuring the sum of the first two positions does not exceed `lex`.
     - Assign the remaining value to the third position.

Given the issues in the decoding logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
