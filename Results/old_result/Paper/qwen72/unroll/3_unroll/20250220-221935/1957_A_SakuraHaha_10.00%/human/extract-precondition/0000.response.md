Precondition: **The function should actually be defined with parameters to match the problem description. The correct function definition should be:**

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

**Where t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and test_cases is a list of t elements, each element being a tuple (n, sticks) where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and sticks is a list of n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.**
