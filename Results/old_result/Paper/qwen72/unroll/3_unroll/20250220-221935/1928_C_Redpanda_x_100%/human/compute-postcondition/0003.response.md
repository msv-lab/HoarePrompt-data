To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to check the condition `i * i <= nn`. Given the state before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9
- `factors` is an empty dictionary (this is not relevant to the loop condition)
- `nn` is equal to `n`
- `i` is 2

Let's analyze the condition:

1. **Initial Condition**: `i` is 2, and `nn` is equal to `n`.
2. **Loop Condition**: `i * i <= nn`

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `2 * 2 <= nn` must be true. This simplifies to `4 <= nn`.

Since `nn` is equal to `n`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 < n <= 10^9, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` (and consequently `nn`) is at least 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `factors` is an empty dictionary, `nn` is equal to `n`, `i` is 2**
