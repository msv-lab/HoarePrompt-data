You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), which is not explicitly passed as a parameter but is part of the input context.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        array = list(range(1, n + 1))
        
        answer = [1]
        
        a = [1, -1]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if (-1) ** i == -1:
                answer.append(array[a[-1]])
                a[-1] -= 1
            else:
                answer.append(array[a[0]])
                a[0] += 1
        
        print(*answer)
        
    #State: The function `func` will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` in a specific alternating pattern. The variables `n`, `k`, `array`, `answer`, and `a` will have been reset and updated for each test case, but their final values will be the state after the last test case has been processed. The loop will have completed all its iterations, and the program will have printed the results for all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each with two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
