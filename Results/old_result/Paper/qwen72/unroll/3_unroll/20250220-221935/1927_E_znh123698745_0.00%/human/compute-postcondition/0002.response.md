The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, each of which involves two parameters: `n` and `k`. Here, `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a positive even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function does not explicitly accept these parameters but is expected to process them based on the input context, which includes the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4).

For each test case, the function processes `n` and `k` and returns a result. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints, so we can only describe the parameters and the context in which the function operates.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a positive even integer such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not defined in the constraints.**
