You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    24
    
    15
    
    27

Output

    1

    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: The loop processes each input integer `x` for `t` iterations, converting it to a 30-bit binary string `s`. It then modifies `s` based on specific rules, potentially increasing its length by 1 if a carry is generated. After all iterations, the final state of `s` and `length` will depend on the last input `x` and the modifications applied. The variable `x` will be the last input integer, `t` will be 0 (since the loop has completed), `s` will be the modified binary string, and `length` will be the length of the modified `s` (either 30 or 31).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of positive integers `x` (where 1 ≤ x < 2^30) provided by the user. For each integer, it converts `x` into a 30-bit binary string `s` and then modifies `s` according to specific rules. These rules involve flipping bits and potentially adding an extra bit if a carry is generated. The function prints the original 30-bit binary string, the modified length of the binary string (which can be 30 or 31), and the final modified binary string. The function does not return any value. After processing all `t` inputs, the final state of the program is that `t` is 0, `x` is the last input integer, `s` is the final modified binary string, and `length` is the length of the modified `s` (either 30 or 31).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation**:
   - The function initializes an array `s` to store the binary representation of `x` with a length of 30 (since \(1 \le x < 2^{30}\)).
   - It uses a loop to check each bit of `x` and appends '1' or '0' to `s` based on whether the bit is set or not.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**:
   - The function then processes the array `s` to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a '1' needs to be adjusted to '-1' and the next '0' to '1'.
   - The loop iterates through the array and adjusts the elements accordingly.

4. **Final Adjustments**:
   - If the flag is set and the last element is '0', it changes the last element to '1'.
   - If the flag is set and the last element is '1', it changes the last element to '0' and appends '1' to the array, increasing the length by 1.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the array and the array itself.

### Issues and Corrections:
- **Binary Representation**:
  - The binary representation is correctly generated, but the array `s` should be reversed to match the standard binary representation (least significant bit first).

- **Adjusting for Constraints**:
  - The logic for adjusting the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if flag == 0 and s[i] == s[i + 1] and (s[i] == '1'):` should be handled more carefully to avoid incorrect adjustments.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - The final adjustments to the array and the length are not correctly implemented. The array should be processed from the least significant bit to the most significant bit to ensure the constraints are met.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        s = []
        length = 0
        
        # Generate binary representation
        for i in range(30):
            if x & (1 << i):
                s.append(1)
                length = i + 1
            else:
                s.append(0)
        
        # Reverse the array to match the standard binary representation
        s.reverse()
        
        # Adjust the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements
        flag = 0
        for i in range(length - 1, -1, -1):
            if flag and s[i] == 0:
                s[i] = 1
                flag = 0
            elif flag == 0 and s[i] == 1 and (i + 1 < length and s[i + 1] == 1):
                s[i] = -1
                flag = 1
            elif flag == 1:
                s[i] = 0
            else:
                pass
        
        # Final adjustment if flag is set
        if flag:
            s.append(1)
            length += 1
        
        # Print the length and the array
        print(length)
        print(*s)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
- **Binary Representation**:
  - The binary representation is generated in reverse order and then reversed to match the standard binary representation.
  - The length of the array is updated correctly as the bits are set.

- **Adjusting for Constraints**:
  - The array is processed from the most significant bit to the least significant bit to ensure that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
  - The flag is used to track whether a '1' needs to be adjusted to '-1' and the next '0' to '1'.

- **Final Adjustments**:
  - If the flag is set after processing, it means the last element needs to be adjusted, and a new element '1' is appended to the array, increasing the length by 1.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical errors in the way it adjusts the array to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements, and it does not correctly handle the final adjustments. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.
