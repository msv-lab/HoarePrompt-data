Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements in the array by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves choosing a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The goal is to find the maximum possible sum and the sequence of operations that achieve this sum.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function computes the maximum possible sum for the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` and stores the result in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations. It uses dynamic programming to achieve this.
     - For a single element subarray, it returns the maximum of 1 and the element itself.
     - For a subarray with more than one element, it tries different splits and calculates the maximum sum recursively.
     - The function correctly handles the base case and recursive case, ensuring that the maximum sum is computed efficiently.

   - **func_2**: This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
     - If the subarray is a single element and it is less than or equal to 0, it returns a single operation to set this element to 1.
     - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray's length, it returns a single operation to set the entire subarray to the MEX value.
     - Otherwise, it recursively divides the subarray and combines the results of the operations.
     - The function correctly identifies the operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

   - **make_stairs**: This function ensures that a subarray forms a "staircase" (i.e., each element equals its index) by performing the necessary operations.
     - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase form.
     - If not, it sets all elements in the subarray to the MEX value and records the operation.
     - The function correctly modifies the subarray and records the operations.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the input, initializes the `res_dict`, and calls `func_1` to compute the maximum sum.
   - It then calls `func_2` to construct the sequence of operations.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum sum and the sequence of operations.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints (array length up to 18, valid inputs) and ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(5 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The functions are designed to handle all possible subarray configurations and ensure the maximum sum is achieved.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.
   - The `make_stairs` function correctly modifies the subarray to form a staircase and records the operations.
   - The program meets the problem requirements and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
