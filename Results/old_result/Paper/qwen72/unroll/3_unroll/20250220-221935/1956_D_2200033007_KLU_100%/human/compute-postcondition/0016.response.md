To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `start_index`, and the range defined by `start_index + i + 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= start_index + i - 1 < len(arr)`.
- `res` is a list of tuples that now includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`.
- `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `arr[start_index + i - 1]` is not equal to `i - 1`.
- The function `make_stairs(i - 1)` has been called.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute, the range defined by `range(start_index, start_index + i + 1)` must be valid and non-empty. This means:
- `start_index` must be a non-negative integer.
- `start_index + i + 1` must be greater than `start_index`.

Let's break it down:
- `start_index` is already a non-negative integer.
- `i` is greater than 0, so `start_index + i + 1` will always be greater than `start_index`.

Therefore, the loop will execute if `start_index + i + 1` is within the bounds of the list `arr`. However, the loop head itself does not require `arr` to be adjusted, only the variables `j`, `start_index`, and `i`.

So, the adjusted state should be:
- `j` is `start_index`.
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `start_index + i + 1` must be less than or equal to `len(arr)` to ensure the loop does not go out of bounds.

State: **`i` is greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `j` is `start_index`, `start_index + i + 1` must be less than or equal to `len(arr)`**
