**Reasoning:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is designed to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` using dynamic programming.
   - It uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where it returns the maximum of 1 and the value at `arr[start_index]`.
   - For subarrays with more than one element, it recursively divides the subarray and computes the maximum sum by considering different splits and the MEX value of the subarray.
   - The function correctly calculates the maximum sum for the given subarray.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is responsible for constructing the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum calculated by `func_1`.
   - It first checks if the subarray is a single element and whether it needs to be changed.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray's length, it performs a single operation on the entire subarray.
   - Otherwise, it recursively divides the subarray and combines the results of the recursive calls to find the optimal sequence of operations.
   - The function correctly constructs the sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

4. **Function `make_stairs`:**
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" form where each element equals its index.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the staircase form.
   - If not, it recursively sets the elements to the MEX value and records the operations.
   - The function ensures that the subarray is transformed into the desired form and records the operations.

5. **Overall Program:**
   - The program reads the input, initializes the dictionary `res_dict`, and calls `func_1` to compute the maximum sum.
   - It then calls `func_2` to construct the sequence of operations.
   - The program prints the maximum sum and the number of operations, followed by the operations themselves.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are designed to work together to solve the problem, and `make_stairs` is a helper function to ensure the operations are valid.

**Conclusion:**
- The program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array and construct the sequence of operations.
- The functions are logically consistent and cover the necessary cases to achieve the goal.
- The use of dynamic programming in `func_1` and the recursive construction of operations in `func_2` are appropriate for the problem.
