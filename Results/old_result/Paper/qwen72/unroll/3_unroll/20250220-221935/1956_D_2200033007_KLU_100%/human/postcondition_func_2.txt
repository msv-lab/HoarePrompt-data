The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i`. It checks if the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is already in a "staircase" form where each element equals its index. If it is, the function returns `None`. If not, it modifies the subarray to ensure it forms a staircase by setting all elements from `start_index` to `start_index + i` to `i` and records the operation in the list `res`. The function ensures that by the end of its execution, the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is in the staircase form, and `res` contains the operations performed to achieve this.
