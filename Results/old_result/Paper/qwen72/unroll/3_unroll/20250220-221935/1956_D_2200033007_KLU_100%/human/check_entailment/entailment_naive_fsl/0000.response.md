Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the elements of the array by performing the specified operations. One issue is in the `func_1` function, where the calculation of `res` is incorrect. The function is supposed to compute the maximum possible sum of the array segment from `start_index` to `end_index`, but the logic used to calculate `res` does not seem to align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the use of `(end_index - start_index + 1) ** 2` does not represent the MEX operation or the correct way to maximize the sum.

Another issue is in the `make_stairs` function, which attempts to modify the array to form a "staircase" of MEX values. However, the function does not correctly handle the MEX calculation or the updates to the array. For example, the function does not ensure that the smallest non-negative integer missing from the segment is used, and it incorrectly assumes that the MEX value for a segment can be directly set to `i` without considering the actual values in the segment.

A specific case where the program fails is:
```
Input:
3
0 2 1

Expected Output:
6 1
1 3

Actual Output:
The program will not produce the correct output because the logic in `func_1` and `make_stairs` is flawed.
```

In this case, the correct operation would be to set the entire array to the MEX of the segment `[0, 2, 1]`, which is `3`, resulting in the array `[3, 3, 3]` and a sum of `9`. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this scenario.
