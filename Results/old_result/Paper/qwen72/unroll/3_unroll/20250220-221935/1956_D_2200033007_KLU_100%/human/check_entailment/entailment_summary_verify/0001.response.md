### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of an array by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The operations should be recorded and the maximum sum should be outputted.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index`.
   - The function uses dynamic programming to store results in `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, where the maximum sum is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
   - For larger subarrays, it recursively computes the maximum sum by considering different partitions and the MEX of the subarray.
   - However, the function does not actually compute the MEX of the subarray. Instead, it seems to be using a heuristic or a different approach to compute the maximum sum, which may not be correct for all cases.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**
   - This function constructs the sequence of operations that achieve the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It first computes the maximum value for the subarray using `func_1`.
   - If the subarray length is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the corresponding operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the subarray length, it calls `make_stairs` to transform the subarray into a "staircase" and appends the operation to the result.
   - Otherwise, it recursively finds the partition that achieves the maximum value and constructs the operations for those partitions.
   - The function relies on `func_1` to provide the correct maximum sum, which is not guaranteed due to the issues in `func_1`.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" where the elements are 0, 1, 2, ..., i.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired "staircase" form.
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray by setting the elements to the MEX value and appending the operations to the result.
   - The function is not correctly implemented. It does not set the elements to the correct MEX values and does not handle the transformation correctly.
   - The function should correctly set the elements to the MEX value and append the operations to the result.

5. **Global Variables:**
   - `arr` and `res` are used as global variables, which can lead to issues in function calls and state management.
   - It is better to pass these variables as arguments to the functions to ensure they are properly scoped and managed.

6. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX calculation is not explicitly shown in the code. The function `func_1` and `func_2` assume that the MEX is correctly computed, but this is not clear from the provided code.
   - The MEX calculation should be implemented and used in the functions to ensure the correctness of the operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues with the MEX calculation, the incorrect implementation of `make_stairs`, and the use of global variables, the provided program is not correct.

Final: **False**
