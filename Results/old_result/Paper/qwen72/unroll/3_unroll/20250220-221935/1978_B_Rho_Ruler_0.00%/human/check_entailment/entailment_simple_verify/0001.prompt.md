You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Binary Search Setup**: The program initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`. This is appropriate because the value of `k` can range from 0 to `n`.

3. **Binary Search Loop**: The program uses a binary search to find the optimal value of `k`. The loop condition `while low <= high` is correct for a binary search.

4. **Mid Calculation**: The program calculates the midpoint `mid` as `(low + high) // 2`, which is the standard way to find the midpoint in a binary search.

5. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` to check if the current midpoint `mid` is a valid candidate for `k`.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the profit for selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price.
   - The profit for the first `k` buns is calculated as `k * b`.
   - The profit for the remaining `n - k` buns is calculated as `(n - k) * a`.
   - The function returns `True` if the total profit `ans` is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition is intended to ensure that the profit does not exceed the maximum possible profit, but it is not necessary for finding the maximum profit.

7. **Updating `ans` and Search Range**:
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `True`, the program updates `ans` to `mid` and moves the search range to the right by setting `low = mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `False`, the program moves the search range to the left by setting `high = mid - 1`.

8. **Output**: After the binary search loop, the program prints the value of `ans`.

However, there is a critical issue with the function `func_1`:
- The condition `return ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not the correct way to determine if the current `k` is optimal. The function should instead return the profit directly, and the main loop should compare the profits to find the maximum.

Here is the corrected version of the function and the main loop:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        low = 0
        high = min(n, b)  # k should be between 0 and min(n, b)
        max_profit = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            current_profit = func_1(mid, a, b, n)
            if current_profit > max_profit:
                max_profit = current_profit
            if func_2(mid, a, b, n):
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        print(max_profit)

def func_1(k, a, b, n):
    ans = 0
    if k > 0:
        ans += (b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2)  # Sum of the first k modified prices
    ans += (n - k) * a  # Sum of the remaining buns at the usual price
    return ans

def func_2(k, a, b, n):
    # Check if increasing k will increase the profit
    current_profit = func_1(k, a, b, n)
    next_profit = func_1(k + 1, a, b, n)
    return next_profit > current_profit
```

In the corrected version:
- `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k`.
- `func_2` checks if increasing `k` by 1 will result in a higher profit.
- The main loop updates `max_profit` to the maximum profit found and adjusts the search range based on the result of `func_2`.

Given the original program, the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the optimal `k`, and the binary search logic is flawed. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.
