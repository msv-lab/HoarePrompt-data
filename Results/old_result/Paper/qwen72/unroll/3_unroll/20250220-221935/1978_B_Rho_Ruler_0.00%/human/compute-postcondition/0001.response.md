Output State: **k, a, b, and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b) and 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, `ans` is `k * b`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to `k * b`, where `k` is a non-negative integer and `b` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k <= min(n, b)` and `1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9`. The values of `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.
