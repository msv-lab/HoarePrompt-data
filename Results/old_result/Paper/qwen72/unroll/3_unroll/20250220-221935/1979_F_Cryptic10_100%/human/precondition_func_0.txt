The function operates in an interactive environment where the graph is defined by the interactor. The graph is a complete undirected graph with n vertices, from which exactly (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function can make up to n queries to the interactor to find a Hamiltonian path. Each test case is defined by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
