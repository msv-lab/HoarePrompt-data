### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1 that satisfies this condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `mex` as an empty list to store the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` and `maxx` to 0, which will help in constructing the permutation.

3. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - The program iterates through each element `a_i` in the array `a`.
   - If `a_i` is greater than 0, it appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` by 1. This is because the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `minn`, and `p_i` should be `minn` to satisfy `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - If `a_i` is less than or equal to 0, it appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is because the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `minn`, and `p_i` should be `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to satisfy `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - It checks if `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is greater than `maxx` and updates `maxx` accordingly to ensure that the next MEX value is correctly calculated.

4. **Verification:**
   - **Positive `a_i` Case:**
     - When `a_i > 0`, the program appends `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn` by 1. This is correct because the MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `minn`, and `p_i` should be `minn` to satisfy `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - **Negative `a_i` Case:**
     - When `a_i <= 0`, the program appends `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`. This is intended to handle the case where `p_i` is a value that has not been used yet and is greater than `minn` by `abs(arr[i] - minn)`. However, this logic is flawed.
     - The MEX of the current prefix of `p` is `minn`, and `p_i` should be `minn - a_i` to satisfy `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. The program uses `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which can lead to incorrect values being appended to `mex`.

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `1 1 -2 1 2`:
     - `a_1 = 1` implies `MEX(0) - p_1 = 1` → `p_1 = 0` (correct).
     - `a_2 = 1` implies `MEX(0, 1) - p_2 = 1` → `p_2 = 1` (correct).
     - `a_3 = -2` implies `MEX(0, 1, 4) - p_3 = -2` → `p_3 = 4` (incorrect, should be `MEX(0, 1) - p_3 = -2` → `p_3 = 2`).
     - `a_4 = 1` implies `MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - p_4 = 1` → `p_4 = 2` (incorrect, should be `p_4 = 3`).
     - `a_5 = 2` implies `MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - p_5 = 2` → `p_5 = 3` (correct).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The program's logic for handling negative `a_i` values is incorrect. It should append `minn - a_i` instead of `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to ensure the permutation `p` satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.

### Final Evaluation:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in handling negative `a_i` values. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
