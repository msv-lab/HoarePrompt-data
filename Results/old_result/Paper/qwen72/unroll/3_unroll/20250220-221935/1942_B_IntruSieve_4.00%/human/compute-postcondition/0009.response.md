Given the initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze what will be printed:

Initial State:
- The `mex` list is printed with its elements separated by spaces.
- The values of `minn` and `maxx` remain unchanged.

Code Snippet:
```
print()
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. The `print()` statement is called without any arguments.
2. When `print()` is called without any arguments, it prints a newline character.

Since the `print()` statement does not include any variables or objects to print, it will simply print a newline character.

Output: **(a newline character)**
