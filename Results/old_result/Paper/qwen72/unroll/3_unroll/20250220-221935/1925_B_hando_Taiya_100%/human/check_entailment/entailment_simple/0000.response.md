### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The balance of the problemset is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The GCD of a set of numbers is maximized when all the numbers in the set are the same.
   - Therefore, to maximize the balance, we need to find the largest integer `d` such that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems each with difficulty `d`.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - We need to find the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x // d` is at least `n`.
   - This means `d` must be a divisor of `x` and `x // d` must be greater than or equal to `n`.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum balance.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x` (using `isqrt(x)`).
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - It also checks if `n` is less than or equal to `i` and updates `ans` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the largest divisor `d` of `x` such that `x // d` is at least `n`.
   - The use of `isqrt(x)` ensures that the program efficiently checks all possible divisors up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for divisor-related problems.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly updates `ans` to the maximum possible balance.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the case where `n` is equal to `x`, the program will correctly return `x` as the balance.
   - For the case where `n` is 1, the program will correctly return `x` as the balance.
   - For the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than 1, the program will correctly return 1 as the balance.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs as described in the problem.

**Correctness: True**
