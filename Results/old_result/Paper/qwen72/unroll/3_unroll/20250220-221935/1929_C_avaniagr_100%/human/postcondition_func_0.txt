The function `func` reads input from standard input, where the first line specifies the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9). The function then evaluates a set of conditions based on these integers and prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function concludes.
