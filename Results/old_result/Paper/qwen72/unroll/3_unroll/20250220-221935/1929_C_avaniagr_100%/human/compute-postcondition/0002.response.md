The function `func` does not accept any parameters based on the provided function signature. However, the description mentions that there are parameters `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` with specific constraints. Given this, it seems the function signature is incomplete or there is additional context not reflected in the signature.

Assuming the function should accept these parameters, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where 2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, and 1 <= a <= 10^9. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific return values are not provided in the description.**
