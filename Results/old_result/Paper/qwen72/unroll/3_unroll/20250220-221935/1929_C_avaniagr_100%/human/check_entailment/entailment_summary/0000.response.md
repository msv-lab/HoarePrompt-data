Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads input from standard input, which is appropriate for the problem.
   - It processes each line of input correctly by splitting the line and converting the values to integers.

2. **Conditions and Logic**:
   - The function checks if `x < k - 1`. If this condition is true, it checks if `a >= x + 1`. If so, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
   - If `x == k - 1`, it checks if `a >= x + 2`. If so, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
   - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` using a loop and checks if `a >= z`. If so, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**:
     - If Sasha can lose at most `x` times in a row, and `x < k - 1`, then he can always recover from any sequence of losses by placing a small bet (1 coin) after a win. This ensures that he can always increase his coins.
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` ensures that Sasha has enough initial coins to cover the maximum possible consecutive losses and still have at least one coin left to place a bet.
   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**:
     - If Sasha can lose exactly `k - 1` times in a row, he needs to have enough initial coins to cover these losses and still have at least one coin left to place a bet after the losses.
     - The condition `a >= x + 2` ensures that Sasha has enough initial coins to cover the maximum possible consecutive losses and still have at least two coins left to place a bet.
   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**:
     - If Sasha can lose more than `k - 1` times in a row, the problem becomes more complex. The function calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee he can always recover from any sequence of losses.
     - The loop `for i in range(x - k + 3): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is used to compute this value. This loop is based on the idea that after each sequence of `k - 1` losses, Sasha can recover by winning a bet, and the value of `z` is adjusted accordingly.
     - The condition `a >= z` ensures that Sasha has enough initial coins to cover the calculated minimum number of coins required to guarantee recovery.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when `a` is very small or when `x` is very large.
   - The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem's constraints and logic.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
