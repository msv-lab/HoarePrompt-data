You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to be called within a context that provides the necessary input as described in the problem, but the function definition is incomplete and does not include parameters. The input should consist of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of cells, and a list of n integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell, where 0 indicates a free cell and 1 indicates a cell with a chip. At least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will print the number of free cells (0s) between the first and last chip (1s) in the list of cells. The variables `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be re-assigned for each iteration based on the input provided for that test case. After the loop finishes, the values of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the values from the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (0 or 1) representing the state of each cell. It returns the number of cells that contain a chip (1).

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
