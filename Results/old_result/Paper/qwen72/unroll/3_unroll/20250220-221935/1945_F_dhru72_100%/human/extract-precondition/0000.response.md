Precondition: **The function should take three parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a list of integers n (each representing the number of mushrooms for each test case, 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists of lists v and p (each of size n, where v contains the magic powers of the mushrooms, 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n). The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided is incomplete. It should be updated to reflect the parameters described in the precondition. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, n_list, v_list, p_list):
```

This function will handle multiple test cases, where each test case is defined by the corresponding elements in `n_list`, `v_list`, and `p_list`.
