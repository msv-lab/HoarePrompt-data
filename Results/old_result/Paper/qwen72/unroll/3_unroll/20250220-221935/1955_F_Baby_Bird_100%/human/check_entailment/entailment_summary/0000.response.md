### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The game involves a sequence of integers (1, 2, 3, 4) and the goal is to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win if Eve removes numbers optimally.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
   - Eve's strategy should be to remove numbers in such a way that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero as often as possible.

2. **XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations does not matter.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to remove numbers in pairs that cancel each other out in terms of their XOR values.
   - The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 have the following XOR properties:
     - \( 1 \oplus 1 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 2 = 0 \)
     - \( 3 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 4 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 3 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 2 \oplus 3 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \oplus 2 \oplus 4 = 0 \)
   - Therefore, Eve can remove pairs of numbers that result in zero XOR, and also consider combinations of three numbers that result in zero XOR.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` representing the counts of 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - The expression inside the `sum` function is designed to count the number of pairs and single numbers that can be removed to achieve zero XOR.
   - The expression `3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3)` is used to calculate the number of pairs and single numbers:
     - `3 * (x // 2)` counts the number of pairs for each type of number.
     - `x % 2 * (i < 3)` adds one to the count if there is an odd number of a particular type of number and it is one of the first three types (1, 2, 3).
   - The result is then divided by 3 to get the maximum number of times Bob can win.

5. **Verification:**
   - The program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy of removing pairs and single numbers to achieve zero XOR.
   - The division by 3 ensures that the result is the maximum number of times Bob can win, as each win corresponds to a sequence of numbers whose XOR is zero.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win by removing numbers optimally. Therefore, the program is correct.
