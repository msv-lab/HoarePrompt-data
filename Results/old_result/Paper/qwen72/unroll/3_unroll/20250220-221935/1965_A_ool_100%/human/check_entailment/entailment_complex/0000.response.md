### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of piles `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with the list of piles `arr`.
   - It initializes a boolean variable `A` to `False`, which will be used to determine the winner.
   - It creates a sorted list of unique elements from `arr` using `set_ = list(set(arr))` and sorts it.
   - If the smallest element in `set_` is not 1, Alice wins immediately because she can choose `k = set_[0]` and empty all piles in one move.
   - If the smallest element is 1, the function checks if there are any gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`.
   - If there is any gap greater than 1, Alice can win by choosing a `k` that is the smallest gap, which will leave Bob in a losing position.
   - If all elements in `set_` are consecutive starting from 1, the function toggles `A` for each unique element, effectively simulating the game. If the number of unique elements is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.

3. **Output:**
   - The function returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True` and 'Bob' if `A` is `False`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Case 1: Smallest element is not 1:**
  - If the smallest element in `arr` is not 1, Alice can always win by choosing `k = set_[0]` and emptying all piles in one move.
- **Case 2: Smallest element is 1 and elements are consecutive:**
  - If the smallest element is 1 and all elements are consecutive, the game essentially reduces to a parity problem. If the number of unique elements is odd, Alice wins; if even, Bob wins.
- **Case 3: Smallest element is 1 and there are gaps:**
  - If there are gaps greater than 1 between consecutive elements, Alice can always choose a `k` that is the smallest gap, leaving Bob in a losing position.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where the smallest element is not 1.
  - It also correctly handles the case where all elements are consecutive starting from 1.
  - The logic for handling gaps greater than 1 is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
