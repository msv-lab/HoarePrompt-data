To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects that are part of the loop head. In this case, the loop head is:

```python
for i in range(1, len(set_)):
```

The variables and objects in the loop head are:
- `i`
- `set_`

The loop will execute if the range `range(1, len(set_))` has at least one value to iterate over. This means that `len(set_)` must be greater than 1. 

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile.
- `A` is False.
- `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
- `not_c` is True.

We need to ensure that `set_` has at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. Since `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr` and the first element of `set_` is 1, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element other than 1 to make `set_` have more than one element.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
- `arr` must contain at least one element other than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr` and must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile, `arr` must contain at least one element other than 1, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr` and must have at least 2 elements, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1**
