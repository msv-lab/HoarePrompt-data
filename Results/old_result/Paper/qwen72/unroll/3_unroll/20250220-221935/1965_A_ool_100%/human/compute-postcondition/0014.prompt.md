You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n integers (1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5) where each integer a_i (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: *`arr` is a list of n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) where each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile, `A` is False, `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: `A` is True, `set_` remains a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr`, and `not_c` is False if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, otherwise `not_c` remains True.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: *`A` is True, `set_` remains a sorted list containing the unique elements of `arr`. If `not_c` is True, `A` is False, and there is no gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`. Otherwise, `not_c` remains False if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, and `A` remains True.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Given the initial state, `A` is True unless `not_c` is True and there is no gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`. If `not_c` is True, `A` becomes False. Therefore, the program returns 'Alice' if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, or if `not_c` is False. If `not_c` is True and there is no gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, the program returns 'Bob'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns 'Alice' if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in the set of elements from `arr`, or if `not_c` is False. If `not_c` is True and there is no gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in the set of elements from `arr`, it returns 'Bob'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if `A` is True, otherwise it returns 'Bob'. Given the initial state, `A` is True unless `not_c` is True and there is no gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`. If `not_c` is True, `A` becomes False. Therefore, the program returns 'Alice' if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, or if `not_c` is False. If `not_c` is True and there is no gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in `set_`, the program returns 'Bob'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
