arr is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the sizes of the piles in a game. The length of arr is between 1 and 10^4, and each inner list has a length between 1 and 2\cdot 10^5, with the sum of all inner list lengths not exceeding 2\cdot 10^5. Each integer in the inner lists is between 1 and 10^9.
