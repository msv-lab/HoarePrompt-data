The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents the initial number of stones in a pile. The function returns 'Alice' if there is any gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in the set of elements from `arr`, or if `not_c` is False. If `not_c` is True and there is no gap greater than 1 between consecutive elements in the set of elements from `arr`, the function returns 'Bob'.
