To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` from each tuple in `test_cases`.

1. **`test_cases`**: This is the list of tuples that the loop will iterate over. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one tuple.
2. **`(n, x, y, arr)`**: These are the elements unpacked from each tuple in `test_cases`. For the loop to execute, the first tuple in `test_cases` must be unpacked into these variables.

Given the state before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `test_cases` has at least one tuple, and that the first tuple is unpacked correctly into `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple, `x` is the second element of the first tuple, `y` is the third element of the first tuple, `arr` is the fourth element of the first tuple, and `results` is an empty list.**
