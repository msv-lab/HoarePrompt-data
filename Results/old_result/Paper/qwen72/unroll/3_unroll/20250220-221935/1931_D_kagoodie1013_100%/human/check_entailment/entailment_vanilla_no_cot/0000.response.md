Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The program is incorrect because it does not properly account for the conditions specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the program is designed to count pairs \((i, j)\) where \(i < j\) and both \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement this:

1. **Residue Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y` for each number in the array. This is intended to help in finding pairs where the sum and difference are divisible by \(x\) and \(y\), respectively.
   - However, the use of `-num % x` is incorrect. The correct way to calculate the residue for the sum condition should be `num % x`.

2. **Pair Counting:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions. However, the way it updates and uses this dictionary is flawed.
   - The program increments the count by `residue_map.get((r_x, r_y), 0)`, which is incorrect because it should be checking for pairs \((i, j)\) where \(i < j\). The current implementation might count pairs where \(i \ge j\).

3. **Key Update:**
   - The program updates the dictionary with `current_key = (num % x, num % y)`, which is correct for the residue calculation but does not align with the incorrect `r_x` calculation.

To fix the program, the correct approach would be to use the correct residue calculations and ensure that pairs are counted only when \(i < j\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, x, y) = map(int, data[index:index + 3])
    index += 3
    arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
    index += n
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
results = func_1(test_cases)
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, x, y, arr) in test_cases:
        count = 0
        residue_map = {}
        for i in range(n):
            num = arr[i]
            r_x = num % x
            r_y = num % y
            for j in range(i):
                num_j = arr[j]
                r_x_j = num_j % x
                r_y_j = num_j % y
                if (r_x + r_x_j) % x == 0 and (r_y - r_y_j) % y == 0:
                    count += 1
            current_key = (r_x, r_y)
            residue_map[current_key] = residue_map.get(current_key, 0) + 1
        results.append(count)
    return results
```

This corrected version ensures that pairs are only counted when \(i < j\) and both conditions are satisfied. The nested loop iterates over all pairs \((i, j)\) and checks the conditions directly.
