The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function returns a list `results` which contains the count of pairs `(i, j)` for each test case, where `i < j` and both `a_i % x == a_j % x` and `a_i % y == a_j % y`. The length of `results` is equal to the number of test cases in `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing four elements: n, x, y, and a list a. It returns a list of results, where each result is the count of pairs (i, j) in the list a such that i < j and both a_i % x == a_j % x and a_i % y == a_j % y. The length of the results list is equal to the number of test cases.**
