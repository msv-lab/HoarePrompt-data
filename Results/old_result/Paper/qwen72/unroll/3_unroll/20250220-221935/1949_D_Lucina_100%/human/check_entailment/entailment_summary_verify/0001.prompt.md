You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 24) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, forming a symmetric matrix. It counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row (and column) and identifies rows (and columns) where only 'F' or only 'S' characters are present. The function then modifies and prints the matrix by replacing '?' characters: if there are more or equal rows with 'F' (no 'S') than rows with 'S' (no 'F'), it replaces '?' with 'F' for the first `n // 4 - 1` rows and columns in the 'F' list, and with 'S' otherwise. If there are more rows with 'S' (no 'F') than rows with 'F' (no 'S'), it replaces '?' with 'S' for the first `n // 4 - 1` rows and columns in the 'S' list, and with 'F' otherwise. The original input matrix and its symmetry are preserved, and the function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the integer `n` and initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input lines, with an empty string at the beginning to make indexing easier.

2. **Counting Known Transitions**:
   - For each scenario, the program reads a line of input and updates the counts in `a` and `b` based on the characters 'F' and 'S' in the input.
   - The input is stored in `xx` for later use.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store the indices of scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - It iterates through the scenarios and appends the indices to `sa` if the scenario has at least one funny transition and no scary transitions, and to `sb` if the scenario has at least one scary transition and no funny transitions.

4. **Deciding Transitions for Undecided Scenarios**:
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`len(sa)`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`len(sb)`), the program proceeds to assign transitions to the remaining scenarios.
   - It first appends indices of scenarios with no known transitions to `sa`.
   - Then, for each scenario, it constructs a new line `nx` by:
     - Keeping the known transitions ('F' or 'S') unchanged.
     - Assigning 'F' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` and their corresponding transitions.
     - Assigning 'S' to all other transitions.

5. **Handling the Case with More Scary Transitions**:
   - If the number of scenarios with only scary transitions is greater, the program appends indices of scenarios with no known transitions to `sb`.
   - It then constructs the new lines `nx` by:
     - Keeping the known transitions ('F' or 'S') unchanged.
     - Assigning 'S' to the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sb` and their corresponding transitions.
     - Assigning 'F' to all other transitions.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the new transition plan, which should satisfy the condition of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry and Consistency**:
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix remains symmetric by only modifying the '?' characters and keeping the known transitions ('F' or 'S') unchanged. This is crucial because the transition from scenario `i` to `j` should be the same as from `j` to `i`.

- **Consecutive Transitions**:
  - The program attempts to distribute the transitions such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type are present. However, the logic for distributing the transitions is not robust enough to guarantee this condition for all permutations of scenarios.
  - Specifically, the program only ensures that the first `n // 4 - 1` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` have a certain type of transition, but it does not consider the overall sequence of transitions for all possible permutations.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`) by ensuring that the known transitions are respected and the remaining transitions are assigned in a way that does not violate the symmetry and the consecutive transitions condition.

### Conclusion:

The program does not guarantee that the condition of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type will be satisfied for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is not correct.
