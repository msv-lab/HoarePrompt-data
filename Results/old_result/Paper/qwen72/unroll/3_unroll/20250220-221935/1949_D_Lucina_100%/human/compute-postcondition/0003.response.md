Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'. `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0. `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0. `xx` is a list containing an empty string.**
