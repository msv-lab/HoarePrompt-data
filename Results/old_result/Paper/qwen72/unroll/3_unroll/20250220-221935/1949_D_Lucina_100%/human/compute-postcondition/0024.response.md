The function `func` accepts a list of strings as its parameter. The list contains `n` strings, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. Each string in the list is of length `n` and consists of characters that are either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The matrix formed by these strings is symmetric, meaning the character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j. Additionally, at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.

The function returns a result based on the input matrix, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Given the constraints and the nature of the input, the function likely processes this symmetric matrix to determine some property or perform a specific operation, but without more details on the output, we can only describe the input parameters.
