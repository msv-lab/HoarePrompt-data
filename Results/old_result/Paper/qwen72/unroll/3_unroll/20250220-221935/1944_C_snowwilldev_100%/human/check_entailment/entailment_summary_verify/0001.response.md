### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and then deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to prevent Alice from including certain elements in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each element:
     - If the count of an element `i` is 1, it increments a counter `t`.
     - If the counter `t` reaches 2 or the count of an element `i` is 0, it returns `i`.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c` by checking the counts of elements in `a`.
   - The logic of incrementing `t` when the count of an element is 1 and returning `i` when `t` reaches 2 or the count is 0 is sound.
   - This approach ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly based on the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same, which is correctly managed by the `defaultdict`.

6. **Function Summary:**
   - The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list of integers `a` from user input.
   - It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a `defaultdict` named `cnt`.
   - The function iterates through the range from 0 to `N` and returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `0` or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `1`.
   - If neither condition is met, it returns `N + 1`.

7. **Validation of the Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and reasoning behind the program.
   - The program's approach to calculating the MEX is sound and aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation for solving the given problem. It correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
