You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Program:

    print(func_1())

- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= a_i < n for each element a_i in the list `a`. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4. The sum of `n` over all test cases should not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The variable `a` remains unchanged. The variable `cnt` is a defaultdict where each key is an integer from the list `a`, and the value for each key is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `a`. The variables `N`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop returns the first integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `0` or the second integer `i` where `cnt[i]` is `1`. If neither condition is met, it returns `N + 1`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, who take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends the picked element to an array `c` and then deletes it from `a`.
   - Bob deletes the picked element from `a` without appending it to `c`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` after the game ends, assuming both players play optimally.
   - MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob wants to minimize it.
   - To maximize the MEX, Alice should try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`.
   - To minimize the MEX, Bob should try to prevent Alice from including certain elements in `c`.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.
   - It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range from 0 to `N` and checks the count of each element:
     - If the count of an element `i` is 1, it increments a counter `t`.
     - If the counter `t` reaches 2 or the count of an element `i` is 0, it returns `i`.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c` by checking the counts of elements in `a`.
   - The logic of incrementing `t` when the count of an element is 1 and returning `i` when `t` reaches 2 or the count is 0 is sound.
   - This approach ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly based on the optimal play of both Alice and Bob.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the array `a` is empty or contains only one element.
   - It also handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same, which is correctly managed by the `defaultdict`.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and implementation for solving the given problem. It correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

### Correctness:
**True**
