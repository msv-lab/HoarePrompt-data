### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case using a for loop, calling the function `func_1()` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of friends.
   - It initializes a list `v` of length `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads a list of integers representing the best friends and appends them to `v` starting from index 1 (to match the 1-based indexing in the problem statement).

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - If `n` is 2, the function directly prints 2 because the only way to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is to invite both of them.
   - This is correct as per the problem statement.

4. **Checking for Cycles of Length 3:**
   - The function iterates over each friend from 1 to `n`.
   - For each friend `i`, it checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition checks if there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships.
   - If such a cycle is found, it prints 2 and returns immediately. This is because in a cycle of length 3, inviting any two friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - This is correct as per the problem statement.

5. **Default Case:**
   - If no cycle of length 3 is found, the function prints 3.
   - This is the default case, and it is correct because if there are no cycles of length 3, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because inviting 2 friends might not be enough if they are not in a cycle of length 3.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles the special case for `n == 2` and the general case for `n > 2` by checking for cycles of length 3 and defaulting to 3 invitations if no such cycle is found. The logic and the conditions used are consistent with the problem statement.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
