Based on the initial state provided, the loop either prints `2` and returns, or it completes all iterations without printing anything. However, the `print(3)` statement is outside of this loop, and it will always execute after the loop, regardless of the loop's behavior.

Since the `print(3)` statement is a simple print statement that does not depend on any variables or conditions, it will always print the integer `3`.

Output: **3**
