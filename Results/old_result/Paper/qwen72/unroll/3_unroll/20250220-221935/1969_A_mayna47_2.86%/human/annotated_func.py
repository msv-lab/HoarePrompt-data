#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list `p` of length `n` containing integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should calculate and return the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The loop will either print `2` and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything. The values of `n` and `v` remain unchanged.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: *`n` is an input integer between 2 and 50, inclusive, and `v` is a list of length `n + 1` where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are integers provided by the user. If `n` is 2, `v` is a list of length 3 with the first element as 0 and the remaining two elements as integers provided by the user. If `n` is not 2, the loop will either print `2` and return, or it will complete all iterations without printing anything, and the values of `n` and `v` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers from the user. It then determines and prints the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. If `n` is 2, it prints 2. Otherwise, it checks a specific condition involving the best friends' relationships in the list `p`. If the condition is met for any friend, it prints 2 and returns. If the condition is not met for any friend, it prints 3. The function does not return any value.
