### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing elements at certain indices to make all elements the same. If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, we should output `-1`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `ar`.
   - It initializes `same` to 1, `num` to the first element of the array, and `minn` to infinity.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting consecutive elements that are the same.
   - When a different element is encountered, it updates `minn` with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and resets `same` to 1.
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the value of `same`.
   - Finally, it checks if `minn` is still infinity. If so, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

3. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where the array has only one unique element and is of length greater than 1. For example, for the input:
     ```
     1
     4
     2 2 2 2
     ```
     The expected output should be `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements, as all elements are the same and the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed. However, the program will output `1`, which is incorrect.

4. **Verification Using Annotations**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `same` is initialized to 1.
     - `num` is set to the first element of the array.
     - `minn` is set to infinity.
   - **Loop**:
     - The loop iterates through the array.
     - If the current element is the same as `num`, `same` is incremented.
     - If a different element is encountered, `minn` is updated with the minimum of `minn` and `same`, and `same` is reset to 1.
   - **Final Check**:
     - After the loop, `minn` is updated with the value of `same`.
     - If `minn` is still infinity, it prints `-1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

5. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case 1**: Array with all elements the same.
     - For an array like `[2, 2, 2, 2]`, the loop will count `same` as 4.
     - Since `minn` is updated with `same` at the end of the loop, `minn` will be 4.
     - The program will print `4`, which is incorrect. It should print `-1` because the array will remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.
   - **Case 2**: Array with different elements.
     - For an array like `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the loop will count `same` as 1, 1, and 1.
     - `minn` will be updated to 1.
     - The program will print `1`, which is correct because removing one element can make the array non-beautiful.
   - **Case 3**: Array of length 1.
     - For an array like `[1]`, the loop will not run, and `minn` will remain infinity.
     - The program will print `-1`, which is correct because an array of length 1 is trivially non-beautiful.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is correct. The program does not handle the case where the array has only one unique element and is of length greater than 1. It incorrectly outputs the length of the array instead of `-1`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
