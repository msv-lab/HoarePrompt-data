The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which represents the total number of test cases `t`.

For the loop to execute, the value of `t` (as read by `int(input())`) must be greater than 0. The state before the loop starts indicates that `t` is provided and is within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Therefore, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`_` is a placeholder variable, `t` (read by `int(input())`) must be greater than 0**
