Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem by finding the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. However, the logic implemented in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.

2. **Logic for Finding Minimum Consecutive Elements**:
   - The program initializes `same` to 1 and `num` to the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - If a different element is found, it updates `minn` with the minimum of the current `minn` and `same`, and resets `same` to 1.

3. **Output**:
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` one last time with the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it prints `-1`, indicating that no consecutive elements were found.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

However, this logic is flawed because:

- **Consecutive Elements Check**: The program only checks the length of consecutive elements that are the same, but it does not consider the condition `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` for the operation to be valid.
- **Minimum Elements to Remove**: The program does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array no longer beautiful. It simply finds the minimum length of consecutive elements, which is not the same as the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent the array from being beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:

1. Identify all valid operations where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
2. Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to prevent any such operation from being possible.
3. If the array is already not beautiful, output `-1`.

Given the current implementation, the program does not meet the problem requirements and will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

Correctness: **False**
