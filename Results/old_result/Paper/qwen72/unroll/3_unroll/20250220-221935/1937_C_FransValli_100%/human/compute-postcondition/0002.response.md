The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. It interacts with a sequence `p` which is a permutation of the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries, each involving four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n). The response to each query is one of "<", "=", or ">", indicating the result of the comparison between (p_a | p_b) and (p_c | p_d). The function must find and output a pair of indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j (p_i ⊕ p_j) is maximized. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find and return a pair of indices (i, j) from a permutation sequence p, such that the bitwise XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized.**
