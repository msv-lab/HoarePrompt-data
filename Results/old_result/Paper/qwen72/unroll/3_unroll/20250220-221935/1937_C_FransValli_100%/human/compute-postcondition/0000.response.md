The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is controlled by the `range(int(input()))` expression. For the loop to execute, the expression `int(input())` must evaluate to a positive integer. This means the input must be a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0.

State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
