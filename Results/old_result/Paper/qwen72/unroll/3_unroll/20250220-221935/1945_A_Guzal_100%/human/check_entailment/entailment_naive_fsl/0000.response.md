Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails in scenarios where the number of extroverts is not a multiple of 3, and the remaining extroverts cannot be paired with universals to form a complete tent of 3 people. 

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 5 1
```
Here, there is 1 introvert, 5 extroverts, and 1 universal. The program will output:
```
3
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
-1
```
This is because:
- 1 introvert requires 1 tent.
- 5 extroverts cannot be fully accommodated in tents of 3 people each, even with the help of 1 universal. The best you can do is form 1 tent with 3 extroverts and 1 tent with 2 extroverts and 1 universal, leaving 1 extrovert without a tent.

Thus, the program does not handle this edge case correctly and should be considered incorrect.
