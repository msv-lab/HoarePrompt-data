### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Introverts:**
   - Each introvert must be placed in a separate tent. Therefore, the number of tents required for introverts is `a`. This part of the program is correct.

3. **Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert must be placed in a tent with exactly two other people. The program calculates the number of tents required for extroverts as `b // 3`. This is correct because it ensures that each tent is fully occupied by 3 people.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, it means there are some extroverts left over who cannot form a complete tent of 3 people. These leftover extroverts need to be accommodated in tents with universals. The program checks if there are enough universals to form a complete tent with the leftover extroverts using the condition `b % 3 + c < 3`. If this condition is true, it correctly outputs `-1`.

4. **Universals:**
   - Universals can be placed in any tent configuration. They can be used to fill the remaining spots in tents with extroverts or form their own tents.
   - The program calculates the total number of tents required as `a + (b + c) // 3`. This is correct because it accounts for the tents needed for introverts and the tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If there are any remaining people (i.e., `(b + c) % 3 != 0`), the program adds an additional tent to `k`. This is necessary to ensure that all participants are accommodated, even if there are leftover people who cannot form a complete tent.

5. **Check for Feasibility:**
   - The program correctly checks if it is possible to form complete tents for the extroverts using the available universals. If it is not possible (i.e., `b % 3 != 0` and `b % 3 + c < 3`), it outputs `-1`.

### Example Test Cases:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `1 2 3`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals. This is correct.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 4 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 extrovert left without enough universals to form a complete tent. This is correct.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1 4 2`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining extrovert and 2 universals. This is correct.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `1 1 1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 extrovert left without enough universals to form a complete tent. This is correct.

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: `1 3 2`
  - Output: `3`
  - Reason: 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 3 extroverts, and 1 tent for the remaining 2 universals. This is correct.

- **Test Case 6:**
  - Input: `19 7 18`
  - Output: `28`
  - Reason: 19 tents for introverts, 2 tents for 6 extroverts, 1 tent for the remaining extrovert and 2 universals, and 6 tents for the remaining 12 universals. This is correct.

- **Test Case 7:**
  - Input: `0 0 0`
  - Output: `0`
  - Reason: No participants, so no tents are needed. This is correct.

- **Test Case 8:**
  - Input: `7 0 0`
  - Output: `7`
  - Reason: 7 tents for introverts, no extroverts or universals. This is correct.

- **Test Case 9:**
  - Input: `0 24 0`
  - Output: `8`
  - Reason: 8 tents for 24 extroverts (each tent with 3 extroverts). This is correct.

- **Test Case 10:**
  - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
  - Output: `1666666667`
  - Reason: 1000000000 tents for introverts, 333333333 tents for 1000000000 extroverts, and 333333334 tents for the remaining 1000000000 universals. This is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
