You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

    #State: The loop has executed t times, and for each iteration, if either a or b is even, 'Yes' is printed; otherwise, 'No' is printed. The values of t, a, and b remain unchanged as they are input values and are not modified within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

2. **Conditions for Forming a Different Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the side of length \(a\), he will get two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the side of length \(b\), he will get two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).
   - To form a different rectangle, the resulting dimensions must be different from the original dimensions \(a \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) or \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) must be different from \(a \times b\).

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles. These can be rearranged to form a \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangles. These can be rearranged to form an \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because cutting an odd side will result in non-integer dimensions, and the resulting rectangles will always be the same as the original when considering rotations.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints "Yes" because Bob can form a different rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, it prints "No" because Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \(1 \times 1\): Both dimensions are odd, so the output is "No".
   - For \(2 \times 1\): One dimension is even, so the output is "No" (but this is incorrect, it should be "No").
   - For \(2 \times 6\): One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For \(3 \times 2\): One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For \(2 \times 2\): Both dimensions are even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For \(2 \times 4\): One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For \(6 \times 3\): One dimension is even, so the output is "No" (but this is incorrect, it should be "Yes").

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where both dimensions are odd correctly. Specifically, it should print "No" for both dimensions being odd, but it also incorrectly prints "No" for the case \(2 \times 1\), which should be "No" as well. However, the logic for checking if either dimension is even is correct.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

Correctness: **False**
