### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He can cut this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can form a different rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they differ only by a 90-degree rotation.

2. **Conditions for Forming a Different Rectangle:**
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the side of length \(a\), he will get two rectangles of size \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
   - If Bob cuts the rectangle along the side of length \(b\), he will get two rectangles of size \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).
   - To form a different rectangle, the resulting dimensions must be different from the original dimensions \(a \times b\) and \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) or \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) must be different from \(a \times b\).

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - If \(a\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangles. These can be rearranged to form a \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - If \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangles. These can be rearranged to form an \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) rectangle, which is different from the original \(a \times b\) rectangle.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because cutting an odd side will result in non-integer dimensions, and the resulting rectangles will always be the same as the original when considering rotations.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints "Yes" because Bob can form a different rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, it prints "No" because Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

5. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \(1 \times 1\): Both dimensions are odd, so the output is "No".
   - For \(2 \times 1\): One dimension is even, so the output is "No" (but this is incorrect, it should be "No").
   - For \(2 \times 6\): One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For \(3 \times 2\): One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For \(2 \times 2\): Both dimensions are even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For \(2 \times 4\): One dimension is even, so the output is "Yes".
   - For \(6 \times 3\): One dimension is even, so the output is "No" (but this is incorrect, it should be "Yes").

### Correctness:
The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where both dimensions are odd correctly. Specifically, it should print "No" for both dimensions being odd, but it also incorrectly prints "No" for the case \(2 \times 1\), which should be "No" as well. However, the logic for checking if either dimension is even is correct.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
