### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He cuts this rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from these two smaller rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different from the original if it has a different aspect ratio (i.e., the dimensions are not the same after a 90-degree rotation).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - For Bob to form a new rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) must be even.
   - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, cutting the rectangle will always result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions. These two smaller rectangles can only be reassembled to form the original \( a \times b \) rectangle or a rectangle with the same aspect ratio (i.e., \( b \times a \)), which is not considered different.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \).
   - It checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle.
   - If both dimensions are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format.
   - The logic for determining if a new rectangle can be formed is correct based on the key insight that at least one dimension must be even.
   - The program correctly outputs 'Yes' for even dimensions and 'No' for odd dimensions.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem's requirements.

**Correctness: True**
