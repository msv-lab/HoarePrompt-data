Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem by checking if either dimension of the rectangle (a or b) is even. If at least one of the dimensions is even, it is possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearrange them to form a rectangle with different dimensions (considering the 90-degree rotation equivalence). If both dimensions are odd, it is not possible to form a different rectangle by cutting and rearranging, as any cut will result in two rectangles that, when combined, will form the original rectangle or a rectangle that is a 90-degree rotation of the original. The program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.
