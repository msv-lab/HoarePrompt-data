The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range defined by the input. For the loop to execute, the range must be defined by a positive integer, which means the input must be a positive integer. The input is expected to be the number of test cases, `t`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop will execute at least once, which means `t` must be at least 1. The placeholder `_` will start at 0 and will iterate up to `t-1`.

State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases, `_` is 0**
