### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` as integers.
   - It also reads the permutation list `p` and the score list `a` as integers.

2. **Path Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the path for both Bodya and Sasha using a loop. It keeps track of the positions visited to avoid infinite loops.
   - The paths are stored in `pathb` and `paths` lists, which contain the scores at each position visited by Bodya and Sasha, respectively.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the maximum possible score for each player by iterating through their respective paths.
   - It uses a prefix sum approach to accumulate scores and considers the number of turns `k` to determine the best possible score.

4. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores, the function compares `resb` (Bodya's score) and `ress` (Sasha's score).
   - It prints 'Bodya' if `resb` is greater, 'Sasha' if `ress` is greater, and 'Draw' if they are equal.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where the number of turns `k` is less than the length of the path, ensuring that it does not access out-of-bounds indices.
   - The function correctly handles the permutation and score lists, ensuring that the indices are within bounds.

6. **Unnecessary Variables**:
   - The variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` are defined but not used in the function. This does not affect the correctness of the program but can be considered a minor issue in terms of code clarity.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" problem and handles all the given constraints and edge cases. The unnecessary variables do not impact the correctness of the program.

**Correctness: True**
