### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It initializes the necessary variables and lists, including `vis` to keep track of visited positions in the permutation.

2. **Path Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the paths for both Bodya and Sasha by following the permutation `p` from their starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`.
   - It correctly breaks the loop when a position is revisited, indicating the end of a cycle in the permutation.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha by summing the values in the array `a` at the positions they visit.
   - It uses a `preb` and `pres` variable to keep track of the cumulative score and a `curr` variable to calculate the score for each possible move up to `k` turns.
   - The score calculation logic is correct, as it considers the score increase for each turn and the potential to stay or move to the next position in the permutation.

4. **Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares `resb` and `ress` to determine the winner.
   - It prints "Bodya" if `resb` is greater, "Sasha" if `ress` is greater, and "Draw" if they are equal.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is very large by breaking the loop when the number of turns exceeds `k`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the starting positions are the same or where the permutation contains cycles.

6. **Unnecessary Variables:**
   - The variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` are not used in the program and can be safely removed. However, their presence does not affect the correctness of the program.

7. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient in terms of time complexity, as it only traverses each permutation cycle once and calculates the scores in linear time relative to the length of the cycle.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" and handles all the given constraints and edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
