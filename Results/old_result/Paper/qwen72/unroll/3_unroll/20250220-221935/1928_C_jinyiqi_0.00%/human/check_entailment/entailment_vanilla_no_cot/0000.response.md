Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for the given problem. Here are the reasons:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find all divisors of a given number `x`. However, the way it is implemented, it does not correctly handle the divisors. Specifically, it appends the divisors in a way that can lead to duplicates and incorrect order.
   - The function should return a list of all divisors of `x` in ascending order, but the current implementation reverses the list of smaller divisors and concatenates it with the list of larger divisors, which can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program is flawed. It checks if `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` to determine if the position and number fit the settling pattern. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the valid values of `k`.
   - The correct approach involves understanding the repeating pattern of the settling and checking if the given position `n` and number `x` fit within the pattern for different values of `k`.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, we need to understand the pattern of the settling and check for valid `k` values. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and we need to determine if the given position `n` and number `x` fit within this pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    valid_k = []
    for k in range(2, n):
        if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k:
            if (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1 == x:
                valid_k.append(k)
        else:
            if (2 * k - 2) - (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == x:
                valid_k.append(k)
    print(len(valid_k))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - Read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, read the position `n` and the number `x`.

2. **Valid `k` Calculation**:
   - Iterate over possible values of `k` from 2 to `n-1`.
   - Check if the position `n` fits within the pattern for the current `k`:
     - If `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) < k`, then the position `n` is in the first half of the repeating pattern.
     - If `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) + 1 == x`, then the number `x` is correct for this `k`.
     - If `(n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) >= k`, then the position `n` is in the second half of the repeating pattern.
     - If `(2 * k - 2) - (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == x`, then the number `x` is correct for this `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print the number of valid `k` values for each test case.

This corrected program should correctly determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
