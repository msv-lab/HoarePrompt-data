Output State: **The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` of length `n` where initially `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The function will be called multiple times for different values of `n` within a test case, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. `n_cases` is the integer value provided by the user input.**
