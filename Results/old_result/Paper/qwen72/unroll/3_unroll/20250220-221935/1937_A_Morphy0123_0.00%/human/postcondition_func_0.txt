The function `func` accepts no parameters. It reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ n_cases ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the input, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After all test cases have been processed, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged. The variable `n` holds the last input value read, and the variable `power` holds the last calculated power value, which is the smallest integer such that `2
