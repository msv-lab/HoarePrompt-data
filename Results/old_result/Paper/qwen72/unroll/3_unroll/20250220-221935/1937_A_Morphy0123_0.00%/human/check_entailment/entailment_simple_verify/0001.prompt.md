You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` of length `n` where initially `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. The function will be called multiple times for different values of `n` within a test case, and the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)
        
    #State: The loop executes `n_cases` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` from the input. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After all iterations, the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` holds the last input value read. The variable `power` holds the last calculated power value, which is the smallest integer such that `2



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `n_cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the length of the array.

2. **Special Case for `n = 1`:**
   - If `n` is 1, the array is `[1]` and no operations are performed. Therefore, the position of 1 remains 1. The program correctly handles this case by printing 1.

3. **General Case for `n > 1`:**
   - The program aims to find the position of 1 in the array after performing the `swap` operations for each `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - The key observation is that the `swap` operation for a number `k` swaps the element at position `k` with the element at position `d`, where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` that is not `k` itself.
   - For a number `k`, the largest divisor `d` is `k // 2` if `k` is even, and for odd `k`, the largest divisor is the largest power of 2 that divides `k`.

4. **Finding the Position of 1:**
   - The program uses a loop to find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - It increments `power` until `2 ** power` is greater than `n`.
   - If `2 ** power` equals `n`, it prints `2 ** power`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `2 ** (power - 1)`.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of finding the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n` is correct.
   - However, the program's logic for determining the position of 1 is flawed. The position of 1 after performing the `swap` operations is not necessarily the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

6. **Correct Position of 1:**
   - The correct position of 1 can be determined by recognizing that the `swap` operations effectively move the element 1 to the position of the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.
   - For example, if `n = 4`, the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 4 is 4, and the position of 1 after all swaps is 4.
   - If `n = 5`, the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 5 is 4, and the position of 1 after all swaps is 4.
   - If `n = 120240229`, the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 120240229 is 67108864, and the position of 1 after all swaps is 67108864.

### Correctness:
The program's logic for finding the position of 1 is incorrect. The correct position of 1 after performing the `swap` operations is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `n`.

Therefore, the correct program should be:

```python
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = int(log2(n))
            print(2 ** power)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
