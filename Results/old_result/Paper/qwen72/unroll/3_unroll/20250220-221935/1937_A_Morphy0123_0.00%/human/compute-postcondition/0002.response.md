Output State: **The loop executes `n_cases` times, and for each iteration, it reads an integer `n` from the input. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it calculates the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to `n` and prints that value. After all iterations, the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged, and the variable `n` holds the last input value read. The variable `power` holds the last calculated power value, which is the smallest integer such that `2 ** power` is greater than or equal to the last input `n`.**
