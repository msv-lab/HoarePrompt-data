You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and b is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9).

    #State: The variable `t` is decremented by the number of iterations the loop has executed, `n` retains its last assigned value from the last iteration, and `a` and `b` retain their last assigned lists from the last iteration. The variable `cnt` is printed for each iteration and is reset to 0 at the beginning of each new iteration. The variable `i` is reset to 0 at the beginning of each new iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple sets of inputs from the user. For each set, it reads an integer `n`, followed by two lists of `n` integers each, `a` and `b`, where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then counts how many elements in `b` are less than the first element in `a`. This count is printed for each set of inputs. After processing all sets, the variable `t` is decremented by the number of sets processed, and the final state of the program includes the last assigned values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the last set, as well as the decremented value of `t`. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, the list of current problem difficulties `a`, and the list of expected problem difficulties `b`.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes a counter `cnt` to zero, which will be used to count the number of new problems needed.

3. **Comparison and Counting**:
   - The program uses a single loop to iterate over the `b` array.
   - It maintains an index `i` to track the current position in the `a` array.
   - For each element in `b`, it checks if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.
   - If `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`, it increments the counter `cnt` because a new problem is needed to replace the current problem in `a` that is too difficult.
   - If `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, it increments the index `i` to move to the next problem in `a`.

4. **Output**: After processing all elements in `b`, the program prints the value of `cnt`, which represents the minimum number of new problems needed.

5. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the number of problems in `a` that are too difficult compared to the corresponding problems in `b`.
   - By incrementing `i` only when `b[j]` is greater than or equal to `a[i]`, the algorithm ensures that it is always comparing the next available problem in `a` with the current problem in `b`.
   - The algorithm does not explicitly sort the `a` array after each insertion, but it implicitly handles the sorting by only considering the next available problem in `a` that is not yet matched with a problem in `b`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `a` and `b` are already in the correct order (i.e., no new problems are needed).
   - The program also handles the case where all problems in `a` are more difficult than the corresponding problems in `b`.

7. **Efficiency**:
   - The program runs in O(n) time for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
