Output State: **t is an input integer, n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and b is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9).** 

The value of `t` is updated to the integer value provided by the user input, while the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged and retain their initial properties.
