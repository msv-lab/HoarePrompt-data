You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the value of `rev_res` has been determined based on the input conditions. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The output of the loop will be either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' for each test case, depending on whether the final value of `rev_res` exceeds \(10^{\text{max\_power}}\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from input, followed by a list of `n` integers. It reverses each integer in the list, checks if the reversed integer has the same length as the original, and constructs a string `rev_res` by appending the original integers if their reversed form has the same length. If the reversed form has a different length, it appends these reversed integers to a list `rev_val`, sorts this list, and then alternates between appending the integers from `rev_val` and their reversed forms to `rev_res`. Finally, it compares the integer value of `rev_res` with \(10^m\). If `rev_res` exceeds \(10^m\), it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input:**
   - The first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - The first line: Two integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5) and `m` (0 ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^6) — the number of integers in the list and the parameter determining when Sasha wins.
     - The second line: `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the list of integers.

2. **Game Rules:**
   - Anna starts by reversing the digits of any one element.
   - Sasha then concatenates any two elements and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game continues until only one element remains.
   - Sasha wins if the final element is not less than 10^m.
   - Anna wins otherwise.

3. **Optimal Play:**
   - Both players play optimally to maximize their chances of winning.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and the list of integers `operational_list`.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program reverses the digits of each integer in `operational_list` and checks if the length of the reversed integer is the same as the original.
   - If the lengths are the same, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_res`.
   - If the lengths are different, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts `rev_val` and then alternates between appending the reversed integers to `rev_res` and their original forms.

4. **Final Check:**
   - The program checks if the final concatenated result `rev_res` is greater than or equal to 10^m.
   - If it is, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program correctly reverses the digits of each integer.
   - However, it only appends the reversed integer to `rev_res` if the length remains the same. This is incorrect because Anna can reverse any integer, regardless of its length.

2. **Sorting and Concatenation:**
   - The program sorts `rev_val` and alternates between appending the reversed integers and their original forms. This approach is not optimal and does not follow the game rules.
   - The game rules state that Sasha concatenates any two elements, not necessarily in a sorted order or alternating between reversed and original forms.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check is based on the concatenated result `rev_res`, which is not the correct approach to determine the winner.
   - The correct approach should consider the optimal moves of both players to determine the final number.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Anna's Move:**
   - Anna should reverse the smallest integer to minimize the impact on the final number.

2. **Sasha's Move:**
   - Sasha should concatenate the two largest integers to maximize the final number.

3. **Winning Condition:**
   - After all moves, check if the final number is greater than or equal to 10^m.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the game rules and the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
