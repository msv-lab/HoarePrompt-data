Output State: **The loop has finished executing all iterations, and the value of `rev_res` has been determined based on the input conditions. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The output of the loop will be either 'Sasha' or 'Anna' for each test case, depending on whether the final value of `rev_res` exceeds \(10^{\text{max\_power}}\).**
