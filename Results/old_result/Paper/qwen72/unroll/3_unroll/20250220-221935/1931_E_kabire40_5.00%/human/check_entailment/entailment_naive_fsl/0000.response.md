Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem. Specifically, it does not simulate the turns of Anna and Sasha correctly. The program simply reverses the digits of the numbers and concatenates them, which does not reflect the actual game rules where Anna reverses a single number and Sasha concatenates two numbers. This approach can lead to incorrect results in many cases.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
2 2
14 2
```
According to the program:
- Anna reverses the digits of both numbers, resulting in `41` and `2`.
- The program then concatenates these numbers to form `412`.
- Since `412` is greater than `10^2 = 100`, the program outputs "Sasha".

However, the correct game play should be:
- Anna reverses one of the numbers, say `14` to `41`.
- Sasha then concatenates `41` and `2` to form either `412` or `241`.
- Since both `412` and `241` are greater than `10^2 = 100`, Sasha wins.

The program's approach of reversing all numbers and then concatenating them in a specific order does not follow the game rules and can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
