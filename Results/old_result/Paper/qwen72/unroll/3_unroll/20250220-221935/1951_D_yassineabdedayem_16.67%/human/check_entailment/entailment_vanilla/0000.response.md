### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and if so, provide the number of stalls and the prices.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` (the number of stalls set up) and `number` (the price per jewel for the current stall) to 0.
   - It also initializes an empty list `tab` to store the prices of the stalls.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is not 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max`:
     - `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
     - `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and decreases `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and decreases `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends `number` to `tab` and decreases `n` by `Min * Max`.
   - It increments `rep` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is 0, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not 0, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
   - It ensures that the number of stalls set up does not exceed 60.
   - It correctly calculates the prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - The logic for setting `Min` and `Max` and adjusting `n` and `k` is sound and ensures that Alice buys the required number of jewels.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by breaking out of the loop and printing "NO".
   - It also handles the case where `k` is 0 by printing "YES" and the prices of the stalls.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem based on the given constraints and requirements. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and does not exceed the limit of 60 stalls.

### Correctness:
**True**
