Reasoning:  
The given program aims to solve the problem of setting up stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels with her `n` coins. The program iteratively calculates the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall and adjusts the remaining coins and jewels accordingly. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` (number of coins) and `k` (number of jewels).

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `rep` to count the number of stalls, `number` to store the current price, and `tab` to store the list of prices.

3. **Main Loop**: The loop continues as long as there are remaining coins (`n != 0`), remaining jewels (`k > 0`), the number of stalls is less than 60 (`rep < 60`), and the number of coins is at least the number of jewels (`n >= k`).

4. **Price Calculation**:
   - It calculates `Min` as the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - It calculates `Max` as the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.

5. **Update State**:
   - It appends the current price `number` to the list `tab`.
   - It reduces the number of coins `n` by `Min * Max`.
   - It increments the stall counter `rep`.

6. **Check Completion**:
   - If `k` is reduced to 0, it prints 'YES', the number of stalls, and the list of prices.
   - If `k` is not 0, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach to determine the prices of the stalls. It tries to maximize the number of jewels bought at each stall while ensuring that the total number of jewels bought is exactly `k`.
- **Constraints**: The program ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60 and that the prices are within the valid range (1 to 10^18).

### Potential Issues:
- **Divisions and Integer Handling**: The use of `int(n / k)` and `n // k` should be consistent. However, the logic seems to handle this correctly by ensuring that `Min` and `Max` are calculated appropriately.
- **Edge Cases**: The program should handle edge cases where `n` is very small compared to `k` or where `k` is very large compared to `n`. The loop conditions and price calculations seem to cover these cases.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 7`, `k = 3`
  - The program sets up 10 stalls with prices `2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11`.
  - Alice buys 3 jewels at the first stall and is left with 1 coin, which is not enough to buy any more jewels.
  - Output: `YES`, 10, `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 6`, `k = 4`
  - The program determines that it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels.
  - Output: `NO` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 255`, `k = 8`
  - The program sets up 8 stalls with prices `128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`.
  - Alice buys 1 jewel from each stall, spending all her coins.
  - Output: `YES`, 8, `128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and logic for the given test cases. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels and does not exceed the limit of 60 stalls.

Correctness: **True**
