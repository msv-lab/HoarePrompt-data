### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and Bob wants her to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys greedily, meaning she buys as many jewels as possible from the first stall, then moves to the next, and so on.
   - The goal is to determine if Bob can set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and if so, provide the number of stalls and the prices.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` (the number of stalls set up) to 0, `number` (the price per jewel for the current stall) to 0, and an empty list `tab` to store the prices of the stalls.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is not 0, `k` is greater than 0, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max`:
     - `Min` is the minimum of `n // k` and `k`.
     - `Max` is the maximum of `int(n / k)` and `k`.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and decreases `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and decreases `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends `number` to `tab` and decreases `n` by `Min * Max`.
   - It increments `rep` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is 0, it prints "YES", the number of stalls, and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not 0, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements.
   - It ensures that the number of stalls set up does not exceed 60.
   - However, there is a logical issue in the way `Min` and `Max` are calculated and used. The conditions and the logic for setting `Min` and `Max` and adjusting `n` and `k` are not sound and do not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.

6. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k` is incorrect because `n * Min` should be compared to `n`, not `k`.
   - The logic for setting `number` and adjusting `k` and `n` is flawed. For example, if `Max` equals `k`, setting `number` to `Min` and decreasing `k` by `Max` does not make sense because `Min` and `Max` should be consistent with the number of jewels Alice can buy and the remaining coins.
   - The correct approach should be to set the price of each stall such that Alice buys exactly one jewel from each stall until she has bought `k` jewels or cannot buy any more.

7. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `7 3`:
     - The program should output:
       ```
       YES
       1
       2
       ```
     - However, the current logic might output a different and incorrect result.
   - For the input `6 4`:
     - The program correctly outputs:
       ```
       NO
       ```
     - This is because it is impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly 4 jewels with 6 coins.
   - For the input `255 8`:
     - The program should output:
       ```
       YES
       8
       128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
       ```
     - However, the current logic might output a different and incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem due to the logical flaws in the way it sets the prices and adjusts the number of jewels and coins. The conditions and the logic for setting `Min` and `Max` are incorrect and do not ensure that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
