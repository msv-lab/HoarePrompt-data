You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it computes the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. The function returns a list `results` containing these values of `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is unchanged, and `results` is a list of integers where each integer is the largest `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the gcd of `x` and `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The function \( \gcd(x, y) \) returns the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case \( x \).
   - For each \( x \), it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of \( y \) from \( x-1 \) down to 1.
   - For each \( y \), it calculates \( \gcd(x, y) \) and the sum \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - If the current sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and `best_y` to the current sum and \( y \), respectively.
   - The loop breaks immediately after finding the first \( y \) that maximizes the sum, which is a critical point to consider.

3. **Breaking the Loop**:
   - The loop breaks after the first \( y \) that maximizes the sum. This is incorrect because it may not find the optimal \( y \) if the maximum sum occurs for a smaller \( y \).
   - For example, if \( x = 10 \), the loop will check \( y = 9 \) first, then \( y = 8 \), and so on. If \( y = 9 \) does not maximize the sum, the loop will continue, but it will break after the first \( y \) that is greater than the initial `max_sum` of 0, which may not be the optimal \( y \).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The loop should not break immediately after finding a \( y \) that maximizes the sum. It should continue to check all possible \( y \) values to ensure that the maximum sum is found.
   - The correct approach is to iterate over all \( y \) values from \( x-1 \) to 1 and update `best_y` only if the current sum is greater than `max_sum`.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it breaks the loop after finding the first \( y \) that maximizes the sum, which may not be the optimal \( y \).
