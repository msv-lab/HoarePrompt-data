Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it computes the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. The function returns a list `results` containing these values of `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. After the function concludes, `t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is unchanged, and `results` is a list of integers where each integer is the largest `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the gcd of `x` and `y` for each `x` in `test_cases`. **
