The only variable in the loop head is `_`, and the loop is controlled by the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The state of `n` and the list `a` do not affect the loop's execution directly, as they are not part of the loop head. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `_` is 0 (though `_` is not explicitly initialized, it is implied by the loop structure)**

However, to ensure the loop executes at least once, we can simplify the state to focus on the necessary condition for `t`:

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5**
