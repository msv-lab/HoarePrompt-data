Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed in a few ways:

1. **Single Element Case**: The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one unique element by printing `-1` because it is impossible to make a single-element array non-beautiful.

2. **General Case**: The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove by counting consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`a[0]`). However, this approach is incorrect because:
   - It only considers the first element and does not account for other elements in the array.
   - It does not correctly handle the condition where the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements that disrupt the "beautiful" property.

3. **Correct Approach**: To determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, you need to:
   - Identify the longest subarray where the "beautiful" property holds (i.e., where all elements can be made the same by the given operations).
   - Remove elements from this subarray to break the "beautiful" property.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # If all elements are the same, it's impossible to make it non-beautiful
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Find the longest subarray where the "beautiful" property holds
        max_len = 0
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i - 1] == a[i + 1]:
                max_len = max(max_len, 1)
        
        # If no such subarray exists, the array is already non-beautiful
        if max_len == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            # The minimum number of elements to remove is the length of the longest subarray - 1
            print(max_len)

func()
```

This corrected program:
- Checks if all elements are the same and prints `-1` if so.
- Finds the longest subarray where the "beautiful" property holds and prints the length of this subarray minus one as the minimum number of elements to remove.
- If no such subarray exists, it prints `0` because the array is already non-beautiful.
