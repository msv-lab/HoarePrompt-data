### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it calls the `func_1()` function.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - **Reading Input:**
     - The function reads the number of houses `n` and the preferences string `a`.
   - **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
     - It initializes a list `S` with a single element `[0, 0]` to store the prefix sums of '0's and '1's.
     - It iterates over each character in the string `a` and updates the prefix sums accordingly.
     - The list `S` will have `n+1` elements, where `S[i]` contains the counts of '0's and '1's in the first `i` characters of `a`.
   - **Finding the Optimal Position:**
     - The function initializes `ans` to `-1` to keep track of the optimal position.
     - It iterates over all possible positions `i` (from `0` to `n` inclusive) to place the road.
     - For each position `i`, it calculates:
       - `left`: the number of '0's on the left side.
       - `lsum`: the total number of houses on the left side.
       - `right`: the number of '1's on the right side.
       - `rsum`: the total number of houses on the right side.
     - It checks if the current position `i` satisfies the conditions:
       - At least half of the residents on the left side want to live on the left side (`left * 2 >= lsum`).
       - At least half of the residents on the right side want to live on the right side (`right * 2 >= rsum`).
     - If the conditions are satisfied, it updates `ans` to the current position `i` if it is closer to `n/2` than the previously stored position.
   - **Output:**
     - The function prints the optimal position `ans`.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly calculates the prefix sums of '0's and '1's.
   - It iterates over all possible positions to place the road and checks the conditions for each position.
   - The conditions `left * 2 >= lsum` and `right * 2 >= rsum` ensure that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - The algorithm also ensures that the road is placed as close to the middle of the village as possible by minimizing `abs(n / 2 - i)`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge cases where the road can be placed before the first house (output `0`) or after the last house (output `n`).
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
