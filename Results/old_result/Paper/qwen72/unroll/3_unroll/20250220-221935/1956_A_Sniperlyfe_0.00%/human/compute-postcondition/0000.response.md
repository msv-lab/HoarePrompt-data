To ensure the `while` loop executes at least once, we need to consider the condition `n >= min(p)`. 

- The variable `n` is described as a non-negative integer, which means `n` can be 0 or any positive integer.
- The variable `p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in increasing order. This implies that `min(p)` is the smallest positive integer in the list, and since all integers in `p` are positive, `min(p)` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to the smallest value in `p`. Since `min(p)` is at least 1, and `n` is a non-negative integer, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, to ensure the loop runs at least once, `n` should be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and `n` must be at least 1, `p` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in increasing order**
