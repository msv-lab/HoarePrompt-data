The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from the user input, where 0 <= x, y <= 99. Based on the values of `x` and `y`, it prints a calculated value. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of `math.ceil(y / 2)` and `math.ceil((x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4) / 15) + 1`. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`. If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0. The function does not return any value.
