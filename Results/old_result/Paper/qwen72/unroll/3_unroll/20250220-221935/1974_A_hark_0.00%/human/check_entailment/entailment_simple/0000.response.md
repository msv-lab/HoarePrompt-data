### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function is not used in the program, so its correctness is irrelevant to the overall solution.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`), which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`. This is because each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons.
       - Adjust the number of 1x1 icons (`x`) by subtracting the number of cells already occupied by the 2x2 icons. This is done by `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
       - Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`), which is `0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
       - Print the total number of screens required, which is `bxsfory1 + bxsfory`.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - Print `math.ceil(y / 2)`, which is the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - Print `math.ceil(x / 15)`, which is the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - Print `0`, as no screens are needed.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then calls `func_2` for each test case, which processes the input and prints the result.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons is also correct: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
- However, the adjustment of `x` in the case where both `x` and `y` are greater than 0 is incorrect. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is not logically sound. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 7` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen can fit 7 of the 1x1 icons after placing 2 of the 2x2 icons.

### Corrected Logic:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
  - Calculate the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons: `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`.
  - Adjust the number of 1x1 icons: `x = x - bxsfory * 7`.
  - Calculate the number of screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons: `bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15)`.
  - Print the total number of screens required: `print(bxsfory + bxsfory1)`.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the adjustment of `x` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.

### Correctness:
**False**
