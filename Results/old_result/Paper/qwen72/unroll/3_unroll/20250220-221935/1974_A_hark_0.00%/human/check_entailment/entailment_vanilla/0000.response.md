### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to place `x` 1x1 icons and `y` 2x2 icons on the minimum number of screens.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means each screen has 15 cells.
   - A 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell.

2. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.**
     - The function calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons first.
     - `bxsfory` is the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons, which is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - After placing the 2x2 icons, it calculates the remaining space available for 1x1 icons.
     - `x` is adjusted by subtracting the space occupied by the 2x2 icons and the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.
     - `bxsfory1` is the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - The total number of screens is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.

   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.**
     - Only 2x2 icons are present.
     - The number of screens required is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.**
     - Only 1x1 icons are present.
     - The number of screens required is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0.**
     - No icons are present, so the number of screens required is 0.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function reads the input for `x` and `y` and calculates the number of screens needed based on the cases described above.
     - The logic for calculating the number of screens is correct, but there is a potential issue with the adjustment of `x` when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
     - Specifically, the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` because each screen used for 2x2 icons can still have 11 cells left for 1x1 icons.

   - **`func_3`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_2` for each test case.
     - The logic for handling multiple test cases is correct.

4. **Correcting the Logic:**
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` should be corrected to `x = x - bxsfory * 11` to account for the remaining space on the screens used for 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program contains a logical error in the calculation of the remaining space for 1x1 icons when both `x` and `y` are greater than 0. The correct line should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` instead of `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. This correction is necessary to ensure the program calculates the minimum number of screens correctly.
