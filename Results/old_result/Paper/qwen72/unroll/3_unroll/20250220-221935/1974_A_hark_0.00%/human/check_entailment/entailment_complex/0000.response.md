### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function simply returns the smaller of two values `a` and `b`. It is not directly involved in the main logic of the program, but it is a utility function that could be used elsewhere. For the given problem, it is not necessary.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.
   - It then calculates the minimum number of screens required to place all the icons.
   - The logic is as follows:
     - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:
       - Calculate the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - Adjust the number of 1x1 icons by subtracting the space occupied by the 2x2 icons: `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.
       - Calculate the number of screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`.
       - Print the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and the remaining 1x1 icons.
     - If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:
       - Print the number of screens required for the 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:
       - Print the number of screens required for the 1x1 icons: `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - If both `x` and `y` are 0:
       - Print 0.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_2` for each test case.
   - The function ensures that `func_2` is called the correct number of times, as specified by `t`.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Handling 2x2 Icons**:
  - The formula `math.ceil(y / 2)` is correct because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and a screen has 15 cells. Therefore, each screen can hold at most 3.75 (or 3 when rounded down) 2x2 icons. Thus, the number of screens required for `y` 2x2 icons is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.

- **Handling 1x1 Icons**:
  - The formula `math.ceil(x / 15)` is correct because each screen can hold 15 1x1 icons. Therefore, the number of screens required for `x` 1x1 icons is `math.ceil(x / 15)`.

- **Combining Both Types of Icons**:
  - The logic to combine both types of icons is a bit more complex. The function calculates the number of screens required for 2x2 icons and then adjusts the number of 1x1 icons by subtracting the space occupied by the 2x2 icons. However, the adjustment `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` seems incorrect. The correct adjustment should be `x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and each screen can hold 15 - 4 = 11 more 1x1 icons after placing a 2x2 icon.

### Corrected Logic:
- The correct logic for combining both types of icons should be:
  - Calculate the number of screens required for 2x2 icons: `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
  - Calculate the remaining space on these screens after placing the 2x2 icons: `15 * math.ceil(y / 2) - 4 * y`.
  - Calculate the number of 1x1 icons that can fit in the remaining space: `min(x, 15 * math.ceil(y / 2) - 4 * y)`.
  - Calculate the number of additional screens required for the remaining 1x1 icons: `math.ceil((x - min(x, 15 * math.ceil(y / 2) - 4 * y)) / 15)`.
  - Print the sum of the screens required for 2x2 icons and the additional screens required for 1x1 icons.

### Conclusion:
- The current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect due to the incorrect adjustment formula for the 1x1 icons. The formula `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` does not correctly account for the space occupied by the 2x2 icons.

### Correctness:
**False**
