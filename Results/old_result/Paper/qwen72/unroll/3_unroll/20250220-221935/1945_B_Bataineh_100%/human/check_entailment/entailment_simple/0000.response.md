### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input.

2. **Conditions and Logic**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - **Case 1**: `if m < a and m < b`
     - If both `a` and `b` are greater than `m`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2. This is because the visibility period `m + 1` is shorter than the launch intervals `a` and `b`, so no more than one firework from each installation can be visible at the same time.
   - **Case 2**: `elif m < a and m > b`
     - If `m` is greater than `b` but less than `a`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // b`. This is because the visibility period `m + 1` is longer than the launch interval `b`, so multiple fireworks from the second installation can be visible at the same time, plus one from the first installation.
   - **Case 3**: `elif m < b and m > a`
     - If `m` is greater than `a` but less than `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // a`. This is because the visibility period `m + 1` is longer than the launch interval `a`, so multiple fireworks from the first installation can be visible at the same time, plus one from the second installation.
   - **Case 4**: `else`
     - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is because the visibility period `m + 1` is long enough to overlap with multiple launches from both installations.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where `a` and `b` are equal, and `m` is very large, as seen in the test cases provided in the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously based on the given conditions. It handles all the edge cases and produces the correct output for the provided examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
