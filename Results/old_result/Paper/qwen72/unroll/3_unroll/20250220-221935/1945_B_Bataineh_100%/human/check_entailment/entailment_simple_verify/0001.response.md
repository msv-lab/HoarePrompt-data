### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually by reading `a`, `b`, and `m` for each case.

2. **Conditions and Logic:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif-else` conditions to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - **Case 1:** `if m < a and m < b:`
     - This condition checks if the visibility duration `m` is less than both launch frequencies `a` and `b`. If true, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2. This is correct because each installation can only launch one firework within the visibility duration of `m + 1` minutes.
   - **Case 2:** `elif m < a and m > b:`
     - This condition checks if `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`. If true, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // b`. This is correct because the first installation can only launch one firework within `m + 1` minutes, but the second installation can launch multiple fireworks within `m + 1` minutes.
   - **Case 3:** `elif m < b and m > a:`
     - This condition checks if `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`. If true, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // a`. This is correct because the second installation can only launch one firework within `m + 1` minutes, but the first installation can launch multiple fireworks within `m + 1` minutes.
   - **Case 4:** `else:`
     - This condition handles the case where `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`. The maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `m // a + m // b + 2`. This is correct because both installations can launch multiple fireworks within `m + 1` minutes.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

### Verification:

- **Case 1:** `6 7 4`
  - `m < a` and `m < b` are both true, so the output is `2`.
  - Correct: Only one firework from each installation can be visible at the same time.
- **Case 2:** `3 4 10`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true, so the output is `10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7`.
  - Correct: The first installation can launch 3 fireworks, and the second installation can launch 2 fireworks within the visibility duration, plus the initial 2 fireworks.
- **Case 3:** `7 8 56`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true, so the output is `56 // 7 + 56 // 8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17`.
  - Correct: The first installation can launch 8 fireworks, and the second installation can launch 7 fireworks within the visibility duration, plus the initial 2 fireworks.
- **Case 4:** `5 6 78123459896`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true, so the output is `78123459896 // 5 + 78123459896 // 6 + 2 = 15624691979 + 13020576649 + 2 = 28645268630`.
  - Correct: The first installation can launch 15624691979 fireworks, and the second installation can launch 13020576649 fireworks within the visibility duration, plus the initial 2 fireworks.
- **Case 5:** `1 1 1`
  - `m < a` and `m < b` are both false, so the output is `1 // 1 + 1 // 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`.
  - Correct: Both installations can launch fireworks every minute, and the visibility duration is 2 minutes, so 4 fireworks can be visible at the same time.
- **Case 6:** `1 1 1000000000000000000`
  - `m > a` and `m > b` are both true, so the output is `1000000000000000000 // 1 + 1000000000000000000 // 1 + 2 = 1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2 = 2000000000000000002`.
  - Correct: Both installations can launch fireworks every minute, and the visibility duration is 1000000000000000001 minutes, so 2000000000000000002 fireworks can be visible at the same time.

### Final Evaluation:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
