### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input.

2. **Logic for Firework Visibility:**
   - The function checks the visibility of fireworks based on the given conditions:
     - If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2. This is because the fireworks from each installation will not overlap with each other within the visibility period.
     - If `m` is less than `a` but greater than or equal to `b`, the function calculates the number of fireworks from the second installation that can be visible at the same time as one from the first installation. This is done by adding 2 (for the initial fireworks from both installations) and the number of additional fireworks from the second installation that can fit within the visibility period of the first installation, which is `m // b`.
     - If `m` is less than `b` but greater than or equal to `a`, the function calculates the number of fireworks from the first installation that can be visible at the same time as one from the second installation. This is done by adding 2 (for the initial fireworks from both installations) and the number of additional fireworks from the first installation that can fit within the visibility period of the second installation, which is `m // a`.
     - If `m` is greater than or equal to both `a` and `b`, the function calculates the total number of fireworks from both installations that can be visible at the same time. This is done by adding 2 (for the initial fireworks from both installations) and the number of additional fireworks from each installation that can fit within the visibility period, which is `m // a + m // b`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal and both are less than or equal to `m`. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2 + m // a + m // b`.
   - The function also handles the case where `a` and `b` are equal and both are greater than `m`. In this case, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct result for each test case based on the logic described above.

### Correctness:
**True**

The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously based on the given problem description and input constraints. The execution summary confirms that the function processes the input as expected and produces the correct output for each test case.
