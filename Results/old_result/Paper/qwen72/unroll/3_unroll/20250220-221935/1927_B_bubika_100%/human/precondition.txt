t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two elements: the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and the second element is a list of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace of the string. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each given trace, there exists a suitable string s.
