Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the line after that.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - The state of the program after processing all test cases is correctly described: `t` remains the same, `test_cases` is populated with the correct tuples, and `idx` is updated appropriately.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case in `test_cases`.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` and a counter `count`.
   - It then iterates over each element `a` in the array `arr`.
   - The key `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which ensures that `rx` is always a non-negative integer less than `x`. This is used to check if `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
   - The key `ry` is calculated as `a % y`, which ensures that `ry` is always a non-negative integer less than `y`. This is used to check if `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.
   - If the tuple `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary, it means there are existing elements in the array that can form a beautiful pair with the current element `a`. The program correctly increments the `count` by the frequency of `(rx, ry)`.
   - The program then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, the `count` of beautiful pairs is appended to the `results` list.
   - The final state of the program is correctly described: `results` contains the count of beautiful pairs for each test case, and the other variables remain unchanged.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element correctly. In such cases, no pairs can be formed, and the count will be zero.
   - The program also handles large inputs within the constraints provided in the problem statement.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results for each test case, which is the required output format.

Based on the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input handling and the core logic are sound and handle all edge cases as described.

Final: **True**
