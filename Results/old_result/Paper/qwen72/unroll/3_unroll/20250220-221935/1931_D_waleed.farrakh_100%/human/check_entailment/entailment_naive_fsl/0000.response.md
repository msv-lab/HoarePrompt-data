Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of the pairs \((a_i \mod x, a_i \mod y)\) and counts the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The logic in `func_1` is sound and handles all edge cases, including when the array is empty or contains only one element. The input handling in `func_2` correctly processes the input format as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
