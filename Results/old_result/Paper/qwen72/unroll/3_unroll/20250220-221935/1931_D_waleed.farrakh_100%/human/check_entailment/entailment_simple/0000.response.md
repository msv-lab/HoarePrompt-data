### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - The function reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the first line for `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line for the array `arr`.
   - The test cases are stored in a list of tuples, which is then passed to `func_1`.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - For each test case, the function initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of pairs of remainders.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` for each element.
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the count of that pair to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of results, each corresponding to the number of beautiful pairs for a test case.
   - `func_2` prints each result to the console.

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Beautiful Pairs Condition:**
  - A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).
  - This can be translated to:
    - \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\)
    - \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\)
  - The remainders `rx` and `ry` are calculated to check these conditions:
    - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, which is equivalent to checking if \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\).
    - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`, which is equivalent to checking if \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).

- **Frequency Dictionary:**
  - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count the number of elements that have the same remainders `rx` and `ry`.
  - This approach ensures that the program efficiently counts the number of beautiful pairs without having to check all pairs explicitly.

### Potential Issues:

- **Remainder Calculation:**
  - The calculation of `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` is correct and ensures that the remainder is non-negative.
  - The calculation of `ry` as `a % y` is also correct.

- **Pair Counting:**
  - The program correctly updates the count of beautiful pairs by checking if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary.
  - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. The input handling, remainder calculations, and frequency dictionary usage are all correct and efficient.

### Correctness:
**True**
