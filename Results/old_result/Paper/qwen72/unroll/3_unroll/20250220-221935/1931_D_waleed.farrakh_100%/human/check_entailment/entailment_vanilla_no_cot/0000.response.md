Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling (func_2):**
   - The function reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then processes the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends the test case data to a list `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (func_1):**
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` and a counter `count`.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` for each element `a`:
     - `rx` is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count`.
   - It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

3. **Output:**
   - The results of each test case are stored in a list `results`.
   - The `func_2` function then prints each result.

The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs based on the given conditions:
- `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` if `(-a_i % x + x) % x == (a_j % x)`.
- `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` if `a_i % y == a_j % y`.

The program efficiently handles the input and output, and the algorithm is correct for the given problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
