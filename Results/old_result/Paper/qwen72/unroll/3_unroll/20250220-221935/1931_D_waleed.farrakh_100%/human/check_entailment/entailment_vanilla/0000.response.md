### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (func_2):**
   - The function reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it parses the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Processing Each Test Case (func_1):**
   - The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It iterates through each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in the array, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The key idea is to use the properties of modular arithmetic to determine if a pair of indices \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful.
   - For a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) to be beautiful, both \(a_i + a_j\) and \(a_i - a_j\) must be divisible by `x` and `y` respectively.
   - The condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv -a_j \pmod{x}\), which is why we calculate `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`.
   - The condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\) can be rewritten as \(a_i \equiv a_j \pmod{y}\), which is why we calculate `ry` as `a % y`.
   - By storing the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`, we can efficiently count the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the constraints \(1 \le t \le 10^4\), \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\), and \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `x` and `y` can be equal.
   - The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\), which is managed by the input handling and the algorithm.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described. It correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
