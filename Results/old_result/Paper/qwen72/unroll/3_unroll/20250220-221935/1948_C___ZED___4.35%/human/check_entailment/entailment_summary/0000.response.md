### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for the Second-to-Last Character in `b`:**
   - The program starts by checking if the second-to-last character in the string `b` (which represents the second row of the grid) is not '>'. If it is not, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n) because it would be impossible to move to the last column from the second-to-last column in the second row. This is a valid check and ensures that the robot has a potential path to the last column in the second row.

2. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The program checks if `n` is 1. However, the problem description states that `n` is always even and `2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`. Therefore, `n` can never be 1. This check is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the program.

3. **Checking for a Path in `b`:**
   - The program then checks if there is any '<' character in the even-indexed positions of `b` (0-indexed). If there is, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This is because if there is a '<' in any even-indexed position, the robot can potentially move left and then down to the second row, which could lead to a path to the last column.

4. **Checking for a Path in `a`:**
   - If no '<' is found in the even-indexed positions of `b`, the program checks if there is any '<' character in the odd-indexed positions of `a` (0-indexed). If there is, it sets `no_path` to `False`. This is because if there is a '<' in any odd-indexed position of `a`, the robot can potentially move left and then down to the second row, which could lead to a path to the last column.

5. **Final Decision:**
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after both checks, it means there is no way for the robot to move left and then down to the second row, and thus it cannot reach the cell (2, n). The program prints 'YES' if `no_path` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

### Issues:
- **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
  - As mentioned, the special case for `n == 1` is unnecessary and can be removed. This does not affect the correctness of the program but is redundant.

- **Logic for `no_path` Variable:**
  - The logic for the `no_path` variable is incorrect. The program should check if there is any way for the robot to reach the last column in the second row, not just if there is no '<' in the even or odd positions. The current logic does not correctly handle all possible paths the robot can take.

### Corrected Logic:
- The robot can reach the cell (2, n) if:
  - The second-to-last character in `b` is '>'.
  - There is a way for the robot to move from the first row to the second row and then to the last column in the second row.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if there is a way to move from the first row to the second row
            for k in range(n):
                if a[k] == '<' and b[k] == '>':
                    print('YES')
                    break
            else:
                print('NO')
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The program first checks if the second-to-last character in `b` is '>'. If it is not, it prints 'NO'.
- If the second-to-last character in `b` is '>', it then checks if there is any position `k` where the robot can move from the first row to the second row (i.e., `a[k] == '<'` and `b[k] == '>'`). If such a position exists, it prints 'YES'.
- If no such position exists, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
- The original program has a logical flaw in how it determines if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). The corrected program addresses this issue and correctly determines the robot's path.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
