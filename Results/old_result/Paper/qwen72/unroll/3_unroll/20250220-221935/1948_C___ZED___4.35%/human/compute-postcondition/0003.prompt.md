You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function receives t test cases, each containing an integer n, and two strings of length n, each composed of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each test case, but their final values after the loop are not retained as they are reinitialized for each iteration. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and the loop completes all `t` iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes up to `t` test cases, each containing an even integer `n` and two strings of length `n` composed of characters '<' and '>'. It returns a result for each test case, likely indicating whether the arrows in the two rows can be aligned in a valid configuration.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
