t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The function receives t test cases, each containing an integer n, and two strings of length n, each composed of characters '<' and '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
