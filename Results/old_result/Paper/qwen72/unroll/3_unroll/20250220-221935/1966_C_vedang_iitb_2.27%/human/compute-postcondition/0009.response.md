Output State: **a is a list of integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= a[i] <= 10^9 for all 0 <= i < len(a). n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a), and n is greater than 2. `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` to the variable `winNext`. The list `a` is sliced from the second element to the end, and the value of `n` is decremented by 1 before being passed to `func_2`. The values of `a` and `n` remain unchanged, and `winNext` now holds the result of the function call. Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `winNext`, but we know it is the result of the function call with the specified arguments.
