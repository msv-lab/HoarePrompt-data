The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of integers with a length between 1 and 2 * 10^5, and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and 10^9. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a).

The function returns an integer based on the following cases:
- Case_1: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case_2: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case_3: The function returns the integer 2.
- Case_4: The function returns the integer 1.
- Case_5: The function returns the integer 2.

Since the output cases provided are not mutually exclusive and do not specify the conditions under which each case is returned, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and a positive integer `n`, and returns either 1 or 2 based on unspecified conditions.**
