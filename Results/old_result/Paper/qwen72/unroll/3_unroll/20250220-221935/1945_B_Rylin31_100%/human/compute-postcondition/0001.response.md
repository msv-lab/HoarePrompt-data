The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, starting from 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` will be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
