The function `func` does not explicitly list parameters in its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `m`, and an additional parameter `t` which represents the number of test cases. Each of `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers with a range from 1 to 10^18, and `t` is a positive integer with a range from 1 to 10^4. The function processes these inputs for each test case and returns a result. Since the specific return value is not provided, we can only infer that it returns some form of output based on the inputs for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m`. `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers for each test case. The function processes these inputs for each of the `t` test cases and returns a result based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.**
