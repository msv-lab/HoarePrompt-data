Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a positive integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `m`, calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1` and `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`, and prints the sum `A + B`. The function does not return any value, and the values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained after each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes without modifying the input variables. **
