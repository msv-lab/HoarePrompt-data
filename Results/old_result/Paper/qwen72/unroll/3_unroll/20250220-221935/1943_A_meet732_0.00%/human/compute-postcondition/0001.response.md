Output State: **The loop reads `t` test cases, and for each test case, it reads `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using the list `cntl`. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it prints 0. Otherwise, it initializes `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and iterates through `cntl` from index 1 to `n`. It decrements `c` for each index `j` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2. If `c` reaches 0 or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, but `cntl` and `c` are modified during the loop execution.**
