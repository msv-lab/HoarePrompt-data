### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game and MEX:**
   - The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns to pick elements from the array `a` and remove them. Alice appends the elements she picks to the array `c`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of the array `c` at the end of the game, where MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (the size of the array `a`), followed by `n` integers.
   - The output for each test case is the final MEX of the array `c`.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the array `a` and increments the count of each element in `cntl`.
   - The program checks if `0` is not present in `a` (i.e., `cntl[0] == 0`). If `0` is not present, the MEX of `c` will be `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - If `0` is present, the program initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0` in `a`.
   - It then iterates through the range from `1` to `n` to find the smallest integer `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2`. This means that `j` is not present in `c` at least twice.
   - The variable `c` is decremented each time a `j` is found with `cntl[j] < 2`. If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, the program prints `j` as the MEX.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will always try to include the smallest possible integers in `c` to maximize the MEX, while Bob will try to exclude them.
   - The program correctly identifies that if `0` is not present in `a`, the MEX will be `0`.
   - If `0` is present, the program correctly identifies that Alice will try to include `0` in `c` and Bob will try to exclude it. The program then checks for the next smallest integer `j` that is not present in `c` at least twice, which is the optimal strategy for both players.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `0` is not present in `a` by immediately printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present at least once in `a` by correctly identifying the MEX as the smallest integer that is not present at least twice.

6. **Detailed Function Summary:**
   - The function reads `t` test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - It counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a list `cntl` of size `n + 1`.
   - If `0` is not present in `a`, it prints `0`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0` in `a`.
   - It iterates through the range from `1` to `n` to find the smallest integer `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2`.
   - The variable `c` is decremented each time a `j` is found with `cntl[j] < 2`. If `c` becomes `0` or `j` reaches `n`, it prints `j` as the MEX.

### Evaluation:

- **Correctness of the MEX Calculation:**
  - The program correctly identifies the MEX by checking the presence of integers in `c` and ensuring that the smallest integer not present in `c` is found.
  - The logic for handling the absence of `0` in `a` is correct and aligns with the problem description.
  - The logic for finding the smallest integer `j` such that `cntl[j] < 2` is also correct, as it ensures that the MEX is the smallest integer not present in `c` at least twice.

- **Optimal Play:**
  - The program's approach to finding the MEX is optimal for both Alice and Bob. Alice will always try to include the smallest integers, and Bob will try to exclude them.
  - The program correctly simulates the optimal play by ensuring that the MEX is calculated based on the counts of integers in `a`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where `0` is not present in `a` and the case where all integers from `0` to `n-1` are present at least once.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem description accurately.

Final: **True**
