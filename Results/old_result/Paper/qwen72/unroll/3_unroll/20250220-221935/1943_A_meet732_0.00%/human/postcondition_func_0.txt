The function reads `t` test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` and determines a value to print based on these counts. If the integer 0 does not appear in `a`, it prints 0. Otherwise, it finds the smallest index `j` such that the count of `j` in `a` is less than 2, and prints this index. If no such index is found, it prints `n`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The input variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not modified by the function.
