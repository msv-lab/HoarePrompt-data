Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, test_cases is a list of t test cases, where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with n being an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and a being a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. results is an empty list.**
