### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach for reading large inputs efficiently.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the length `n` and the array `arr` for each test case and storing them in a list `test_cases`.

2. **Median Calculation:**
   - For each test case, the array is sorted using `arr.sort()`.
   - The median index is calculated as `median_index = n // 2`. This is correct because the median is the middle element in a sorted array of odd length, and the left middle element in a sorted array of even length.

3. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A heap is created from the elements starting from the median index to the end of the array. This is done using `heap = arr[median_index:]` and `heapq.heapify(heap)`.
   - The heap is used to efficiently find and increment the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

4. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each increment operation is counted and added to `operations`.

5. **Output:**
   - The number of operations required to increase the median is appended to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the results are printed one by one.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of Median Calculation:**
  - The median index is correctly calculated as `n // 2`, which is the middle index for odd-length arrays and the left middle index for even-length arrays.
- **Heap Usage:**
  - The heap is correctly initialized and used to find the smallest elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.
- **Increment Logic:**
  - The while loop ensures that the smallest element in the heap is incremented until it is greater than the current median. This is the correct approach to minimize the number of operations.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases such as arrays of length 1 and arrays with all elements being the same.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The use of a heap ensures that the operations are performed efficiently.

### Correctness:
**True**
