Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the case when the array length `n` is even. According to the problem description, the median for an even-length array should be the element at the index \(\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil\), which is the element at index `n // 2` in a 0-indexed array. However, the program incorrectly uses the element at index `n // 2` as the starting point for the heap, which is the second middle element in an even-length array. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the test case:
```
n = 4
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the median should be the element at index \(\lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2\), which is `3`. However, the program will start with the element at index `2` (which is `3`) and will not correctly handle the need to increase the first middle element (which is `2`).

To fix this, the program should consider both middle elements for even-length arrays and ensure that the median is increased correctly.
