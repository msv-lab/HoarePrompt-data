Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers where each element a[j] is an integer (1 ≤ a[j] ≤ 100).**

Explanation:
- The code snippet `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input and converts it into a list of integers.
- The initial state mentions that `a` is a list of lists, but after this code snippet, `a` is updated to be a single list of integers.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The elements of `a` are now integers within the range 1 to 100, as specified in the initial state.
