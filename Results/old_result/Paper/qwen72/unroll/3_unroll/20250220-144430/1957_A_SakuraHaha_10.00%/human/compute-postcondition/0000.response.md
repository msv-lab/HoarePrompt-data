The value of `n` is assigned the integer value of the input provided. The other variables and conditions specified in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of lists where each a[i] is a list of stick lengths for the i-th test case, with each stick length a[i][j] being an integer (1 ≤ a[i][j] ≤ 100).
