The only objects in the loop head are the variable `x` and the dictionary `cnt`. The loop will execute based on the values in `cnt`. For the loop to execute, `cnt` must have at least one key-value pair, and `x` will be the value of the first key-value pair in `cnt`.

State: **`t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` remains the input integer, `a` remains the list of integers where each element a[j] is an integer (1 ≤ a[j] ≤ 100), `ans` remains 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`, `cnt` must have at least one key-value pair, `x` is the value of the first key-value pair in `cnt`**
