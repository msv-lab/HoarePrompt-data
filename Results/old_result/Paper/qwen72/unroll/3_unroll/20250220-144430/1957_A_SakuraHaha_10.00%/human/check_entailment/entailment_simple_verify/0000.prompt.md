You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):

    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
    print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of lists a, where t is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), each n[i] is the number of sticks for the i-th test case (1 ≤ n[i] ≤ 100), and each a[i] is a list of stick lengths for the i-th test case, with each stick length a[i][j] being an integer (1 ≤ a[i][j] ≤ 100).
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` remains the input integer, `a` remains the list of integers where each element a[j] is an integer (1 ≤ a[j] ≤ 100), `ans` remains 0, `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `t` remains the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), `n` remains the input integer, `a` remains the list of integers where each element a[j] is an integer (1 ≤ a[j] ≤ 100), `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4, `cnt` remains a dictionary where each key is an integer from the list `a` and each value is the count of how many times that integer appears in `a`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(ans)` statement will print the sum of the floor division of each count in `cnt` by 4.
    #   - Since the exact list `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.
    #
    #Output:



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program incorrectly assumes that the only possible regular polygons are those with 4 sides (squares). However, the problem description states that we need to find the maximum number of regular polygons, which can have any number of sides (3 or more). The program should consider all possible regular polygons, not just squares.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
6
2 2 2 2 2 2
```
The correct output should be `1` because we can form a regular hexagon with all 6 sticks of length 2. However, the given program will output `1` because it only counts the number of squares that can be formed, which is `1` (using 4 out of the 6 sticks). This is incorrect since the program is not considering the possibility of forming other regular polygons like a hexagon.
