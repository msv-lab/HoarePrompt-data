To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables and conditions that are part of the loop head. The loop head in this case is:
```
for i in range(mid):
```
The loop will execute if `mid` is greater than 0. Let's analyze the given state and the loop head:

- `left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` <= `right`.
- `(right - left + 1)` is the number of elements to be assigned in the array `arr`.
- `clique` is an integer representing the clique number to be assigned to the elements in the range `[left, right]` in the `cliquess` array.
- `arr` and `cliquess` are lists of integers with at least `(right - left + 1)` elements each.
- `small_element` is `left + 1`.
- `big_element` is `right + 1`.
- `mid` is `(right - left) // 2`.
- `not_mid` is `(right - left + 1) - mid`.

For the loop to execute, `mid` must be greater than 0. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(right - left) // 2`, this means that `(right - left)` must be greater than 0. Therefore, `right` must be greater than `left`.

The state of `i` is not explicitly given, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

So, the adjusted state to ensure the loop executes is:
State: **`left` and `right` are non-negative integers such that `left` < `right`, `mid` is `(right - left) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
