The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `not_mid`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `not_mid`. If `not_mid` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`i` is 0, `not_mid` must be greater than 0**
