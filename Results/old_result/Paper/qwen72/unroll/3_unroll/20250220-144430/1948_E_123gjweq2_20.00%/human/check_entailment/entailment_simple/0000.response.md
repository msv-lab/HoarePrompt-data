### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates over them.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and calls `func_1(n, k)`.

2. **Clique Calculation**:
   - The number of cliques is calculated using `ceil(n / k)`. This is correct because it ensures that the vertices are divided into the minimum number of segments (cliques) based on the given `k`.

3. **Array Initialization**:
   - Two arrays, `arr` and `cliquess`, are initialized to store the vertex assignments and the clique assignments, respectively.

4. **Segment Assignment**:
   - The program iterates over the number of cliques and calls `make_array(left, right, clique)` to assign values to the vertices and clique numbers.
   - The `left` and `right` values are calculated correctly to divide the vertices into segments.

5. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function assigns values to the vertices in the specified range `[left, right]`.
   - It divides the range into two parts: the first part assigns values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1`, and the second part assigns values from `big_element - not_mid + 1` to `big_element`.
   - Both parts correctly assign the same clique number to the vertices in the range.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the vertex assignments, the number of cliques, and the clique assignments.
   - However, there is a mistake in the output state comments:
     - The comment for `print(*arr)` suggests that it prints the values of the segments, which is correct.
     - The comment for `print(cliques)` suggests that it prints the list of segments, which is incorrect. It should print the integer `cliques`.
     - The comment for `print(*cliquess)` suggests that it prints the elements of `cliquess`, which is correct.

### Correctness:
- The program logic is correct in terms of how it assigns values to vertices and determines the number of cliques.
- The function `make_array` correctly assigns values and clique numbers to the vertices.
- The output format is correct according to the problem description.

However, there is a minor issue in the comments for the output state, specifically for `print(cliques)`. The actual output will be an integer, not a list.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem. The comments for the output state are slightly misleading but do not affect the correctness of the program's execution.
