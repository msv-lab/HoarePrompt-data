Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \). According to the problem description, if \( k \ge n \), the graph should be a complete graph, and all vertices should belong to a single clique. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `make_array` does not account for this scenario and will still attempt to partition the vertices into multiple cliques, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input \( n = 8 \) and \( k = 16 \). The expected output should be:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```
However, the program will output:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```
This is incorrect because the graph should be partitioned into a single clique when \( k \ge n \).
