The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the result of `int(input())`. The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head, but it is mentioned that `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, which implies that `t` is the number of test cases. Therefore, `int(input())` should be `t` to ensure the loop executes the correct number of times.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be `t`**
