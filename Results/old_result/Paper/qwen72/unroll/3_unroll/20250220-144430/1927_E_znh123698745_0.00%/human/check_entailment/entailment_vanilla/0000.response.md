### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The permutation should contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - `k` is guaranteed to be even.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It initializes `answer` with `[1]` and `a` with `[1, -1]`.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If `(-1) ** i` is -1, it appends `array[a[-1]]` to `answer` and decrements `a[-1]`.
     - Otherwise, it appends `array[a[0]]` to `answer` and increments `a[0]`.
   - Finally, it prints the elements of `answer`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `array` is correctly initialized with integers from 1 to `n`.
     - `answer` starts with `[1]`, which is a valid starting point.
     - `a` is initialized with `[1, -1]`, which will be used to alternate between the start and end of the `array`.

   - **Loop Logic:**
     - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, which means it will append `n-1` elements to `answer`, making the total length of `answer` equal to `n`.
     - The condition `(-1) ** i == -1` alternates between true and false for each iteration, ensuring that elements are taken alternately from the start and end of `array`.
     - This alternating pattern helps in balancing the sums of the continuous segments of length `k`.

   - **Sum of Segments:**
     - By alternating between the start and end of `array`, the program ensures that the sums of the continuous segments of length `k` are balanced.
     - For example, if `k = 4`, the segments will look like:
       - `[1, 8, 4, 10]`
       - `[8, 4, 10, 2]`
       - `[4, 10, 2, 7]`
       - etc.
     - The sums of these segments will be close to each other, differing by no more than 1.

   - **Output:**
     - The program prints the elements of `answer`, which is a permutation of length `n`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly constructs a permutation that meets the k-level condition.
   - The alternating pattern ensures that the sums of the continuous segments of length `k` are balanced.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
