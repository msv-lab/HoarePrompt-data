You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stack has an array a of length n . He also has an empty set S . Note that S is
not a multiset.

He will do the following three-step operation exactly n times:

  1. Select an index i such that 1 \leq i \leq |a| . 
  2. Insert^\dagger a_i + i into S . 
  3. Delete a_i from a . Note that the indices of all elements to the right of a_i will decrease by 1 . 

Note that after n operations, a will be empty.

Stack will now construct a new array b which is S sorted in decreasing order.
Formally, b is an array of size |S| where b_i is the i -th largest element of
S for all 1 \leq i \leq |S| .

Find the lexicographically largest^\ddagger b that Stack can make.

^\dagger A set can only contain unique elements. Inserting an element that is
already present in a set will not change the elements of the set.

^\ddagger An array p is lexicographically larger than a sequence q if and only
if one of the following holds:

  * q is a prefix of p , but p \ne q ; or 
  * in the first position where p and q differ, the array p has a larger element than the corresponding element in q . 

Note that [3,1,4,1,5] is lexicographically larger than [3,1,3] , [\,] , and
[3,1,4,1] but not [3,1,4,1,5,9] , [3,1,4,1,5] , and [4] .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 3
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{n} (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of array a .

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically largest b .

Example

    2
    
    2 1
    
    5
    
    1 100 1000 1000000 1000000000
    
    3
    
    6 4 8

Output

    3 2 
    1000000005 1000004 1003 102 2 
    11 7 6 
    
Note

In the first test case, select i=1 in the first operation, insert a_1 + 1 = 3
in S , and delete a_1 from a . After the first operation, a becomes a=[1] . In
the second operation, we select i=1 again and insert a_1 + 1 = 2 in S . Thus
S=\\{2, 3\\} , and b = [3, 2] .

Note that if you select i=2 in the first operation, and i=1 in the second
operation, S=\\{3\\} as 3 will be inserted twice, resulting in b=[3] .

As [3,2] is lexicographically larger than [3] , we should select i=1 in the
first operation.

In the second test case, in each operation, select the last element.

- Program:
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        a[i] += i + 1
    counter = Counter(a)
    cur = 0
    a = list(set(a))
    a.sort(reverse=True)
    cnt = n - len(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if i > 0:
            adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
            for j in range(adv):
                ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
            cnt -= adv
            cur -= adv
        ans.append(a[i])
        counter[a[i]] -= 1
        cur += counter[a[i]]
    for _ in range(cnt):
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input. It then increments each element of `a` by its index plus one. After processing, the function constructs a list `ans` that contains the elements of `a` in descending order, with additional elements inserted to ensure the length of `ans` is equal to `n`. The additional elements are chosen to be the largest possible values that do not violate the descending order and are not already present in `a`. The function prints the elements of `ans` as a space-separated list. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is correct as it follows the problem description where `a[i] + i` is inserted into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in decreasing order, which is necessary for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the final array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - For each element, it also appends additional elements to `ans` to account for the duplicates that were removed by the set conversion. This is done by calculating the number of elements that can be inserted between the current and the previous element in the sorted list, ensuring that these elements are as large as possible to maintain lexicographical order.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - After processing all unique elements, the program appends the remaining elements to `ans` in decreasing order. This ensures that the final array `b` is of the correct length and is lexicographically largest.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Step 1:**
  - Reading the number of test cases and iterating over them is correct.
  - Reading the length of the array `n` and the array `a` for each test case is also correct.

- **Step 2:**
  - Modifying `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element is correct as per the problem description.

- **Step 3:**
  - Using a `Counter` to count occurrences is correct.
  - Converting `a` to a set and sorting it in descending order is correct and ensures that the elements are unique and in the required order.

- **Step 4:**
  - The logic for appending elements to `ans` and handling duplicates is correct. It ensures that the elements are added in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.
  - The use of `cur` and `cnt` to manage the number of additional elements to be added is correct and follows the problem constraints.

- **Step 5:**
  - Appending the remaining elements to `ans` in decreasing order is correct and ensures that the final array `b` is of the correct length and is lexicographically largest.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
