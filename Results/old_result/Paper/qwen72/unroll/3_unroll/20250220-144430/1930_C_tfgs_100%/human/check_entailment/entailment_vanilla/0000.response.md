### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Modification of Array `a`:**
   - The program modifies the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element `a[i]`. This step is correct as it follows the problem description where `a[i] + i` is inserted into the set `S`.

3. **Counting and Sorting:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in decreasing order, which is necessary for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`.

4. **Constructing Array `b`:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the elements of the final array `b`.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements of `a` and appends them to `ans`.
   - For each element, it also appends additional elements to `ans` to account for the duplicates that were removed by the set conversion. This is done by calculating the number of elements that can be inserted between the current and the previous element in the sorted list, ensuring that these elements are as large as possible to maintain lexicographical order.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements:**
   - After processing all unique elements, the program appends the remaining elements to `ans` in decreasing order. This ensures that the final array `b` is of the correct length and is lexicographically largest.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Step 1:**
  - Reading the number of test cases and iterating over them is correct.
  - Reading the length of the array `n` and the array `a` for each test case is also correct.

- **Step 2:**
  - Modifying `a` by adding `i + 1` to each element is correct as per the problem description.

- **Step 3:**
  - Using a `Counter` to count occurrences is correct.
  - Converting `a` to a set and sorting it in descending order is correct and ensures that the elements are unique and in the required order.

- **Step 4:**
  - The logic for appending elements to `ans` and handling duplicates is correct. It ensures that the elements are added in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.
  - The use of `cur` and `cnt` to manage the number of additional elements to be added is correct and follows the problem constraints.

- **Step 5:**
  - Appending the remaining elements to `ans` in decreasing order is correct and ensures that the final array `b` is of the correct length and is lexicographically largest.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all the constraints and requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
