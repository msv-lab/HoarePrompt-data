The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The total number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns the results for all test cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It processes each test case and returns the results for all test cases.**
