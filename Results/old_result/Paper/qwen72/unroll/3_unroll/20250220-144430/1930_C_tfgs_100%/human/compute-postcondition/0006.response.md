Output State: **The list `a` is now a list of unique elements from the original list `a` (each element increased by their respective index plus one). The integer `n` and the number of test cases `t` remain unchanged. `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`. `cur` is 0.**

Explanation:
- The code `a = list(set(a))` converts `a` into a set to remove duplicates and then converts it back into a list, ensuring that `a` now contains only unique elements.
- The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged.
- The `counter` object, which originally contained the frequency of each element in the updated list `a`, will now reflect the frequencies of the unique elements in the new list `a`.
- The value of `cur` remains 0.
