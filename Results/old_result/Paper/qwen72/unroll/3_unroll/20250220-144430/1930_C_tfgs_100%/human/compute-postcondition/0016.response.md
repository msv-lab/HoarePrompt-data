Functionality: ** The function `func_1` processes a single test case where it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers from the input. It then increments each element of `a` by its index plus one. After processing, the function constructs a list `ans` that contains the elements of `a` in descending order, with additional elements inserted to ensure the length of `ans` is equal to `n`. The additional elements are chosen to be the largest possible values that do not violate the descending order and are not already present in `a`. The function prints the elements of `ans` as a space-separated list. The function does not return any value. **
