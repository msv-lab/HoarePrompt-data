### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case using a loop. Inside each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Modification of `a`:**
   - The program modifies each element of `a` by adding its index plus one (`a[i] += i + 1`). This step is in line with the problem description, where each element `a_i` is incremented by `i + 1` before being inserted into the set `S`.

3. **Set Operations:**
   - The program converts the modified list `a` to a set to ensure all elements are unique, as required by the problem statement. It then sorts the set in descending order to construct the array `b`.

4. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each element in the modified list `a`. This is necessary because the problem requires constructing the lexicographically largest array `b`, and we need to ensure that we insert the largest possible values that are not already in `S`.

5. **Constructing `ans`:**
   - The program constructs the list `ans` by iterating over the sorted unique elements of `a` in descending order. It ensures that the total length of `ans` is `n` by inserting additional elements where necessary. The additional elements are chosen to be the largest possible values that do not violate the descending order and are not already present in `a`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` as a space-separated list, which is the correct format for the output.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly follows the steps described in the problem statement.
- It handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.
- The logic for constructing the lexicographically largest array `b` is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
