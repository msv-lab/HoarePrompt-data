The function `func_1` is intended to handle multiple test cases. It accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n` representing the size of the list `a`. The constraints are 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. Additionally, it should handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

However, the provided function signature `def func_1():` does not include any parameters. Assuming the function should be defined with the correct parameters, the function would look like this:
```
def func_1(t, n, a):
```

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `n` is an integer representing the size of the list `a`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5.
- `a` is a list of integers, where each element `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.

The function should return different values based on the input:
- For each test case, the function should return a result based on the list `a` and its size `n`.

Since the specific output logic is not provided, I will describe the general functionality based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases), `n` (an integer representing the size of the list), and `a` (a list of integers). It processes each test case and returns a result based on the list `a` and its size `n`, ensuring that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n.**
