Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and then for each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`. It then compares `x` and `y` and prints the minimum followed by the maximum. This logic works for all possible inputs within the given constraints (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 100). The program handles all edge cases, such as when `x` and `y` are equal, and it correctly outputs the minimum and maximum values in every scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.
