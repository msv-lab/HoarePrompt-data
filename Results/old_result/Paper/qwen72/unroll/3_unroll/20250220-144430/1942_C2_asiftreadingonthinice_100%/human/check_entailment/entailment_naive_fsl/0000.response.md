Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie and the additional vertices chosen by you do not form the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of triangles and the way it handles the gaps between chosen vertices is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
8 4 2
1 3 5 7
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

Actual Output:
```
6
```

In this test case, Bessie has chosen the vertices 1, 3, 5, and 7. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed by adding up to 2 more vertices is 4. However, the program incorrectly outputs 6. This is because the program does not correctly account for the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices that can be added to form triangles. The logic for adding the number of triangles and the way it handles the remaining vertices is not robust enough to handle all edge cases.
