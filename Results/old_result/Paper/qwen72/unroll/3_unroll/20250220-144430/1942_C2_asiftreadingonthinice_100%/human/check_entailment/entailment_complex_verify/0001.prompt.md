You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: The values of `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are unchanged, and the list `a` is sorted. The variable `ans` is updated to the minimum of the calculated `ans` and `n - 2` for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `tt` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers `a` within the range [1, n]. The function calculates a value `ans` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `a` and the value of `y`. It then prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `tt`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the list `a` is sorted.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tt`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads the list of vertices `a` chosen by Bessie and sorts it.

2. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is because each vertex chosen by Bessie and you can potentially form a triangle with two other vertices, but we need to subtract 2 to avoid overcounting the initial vertices.

3. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of vertices `a` to calculate the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive vertices is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans` because this gap can form a triangle.
   - If the gap is even, it appends the gap divided by 2 to the list `tmp`. This is because an even gap can be split into multiple segments that can form triangles.

4. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertex:**
   - The program checks the gap between the last and first vertex in the sorted list `a`.
   - If this gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans`.
   - If the gap is even, it appends the gap divided by 2 to the list `tmp`.

5. **Optimizing the Number of Triangles:**
   - The list `tmp` is sorted to handle the smallest gaps first.
   - The program iterates through `tmp` and checks if the remaining `y` vertices can be used to form additional triangles.
   - If `y` is greater than or equal to `i - 1` (where `i` is the gap size), it adds `i` to `ans` and decreases `y` by `i - 1`.
   - If `y` is less than `i - 1`, it breaks out of the loop.

6. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program adds the remaining `y` vertices to `ans`.
   - It prints the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2` because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with `n` sides is `n - 2`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the gaps between chosen vertices and optimizes the number of triangles by using the remaining vertices.
- The logic for handling even gaps and the gap between the last and first vertex is sound.
- The final answer is correctly bounded by `n - 2`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the reasoning provided.
