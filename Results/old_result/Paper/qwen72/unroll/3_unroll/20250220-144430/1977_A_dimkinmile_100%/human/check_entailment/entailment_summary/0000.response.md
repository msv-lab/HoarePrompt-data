Reasoning:
The program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible for Nikita to build a tower with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, where each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower. The key to solving this problem is understanding the nature of the moves:

1. **Initial State**: The tower starts with 0 cubes.
2. **Moves**: Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the tower.
3. **Final State**: After `n` moves, the tower should have exactly `m` cubes.

To achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of cubes added must be exactly `m` more than the number of cubes removed. This can be mathematically represented as:
- Let `a` be the number of cubes added.
- Let `r` be the number of cubes removed.
- We have `a + r = n` (total moves).
- We also have `a - r = m` (final number of cubes).

By solving these two equations, we get:
- `a = (n + m) / 2`
- `r = (n - m) / 2`

For `a` and `r` to be non-negative integers, both `(n + m)` and `(n - m)` must be even, and `n - m` must be non-negative.

The program checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`. This is correct because:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that `n - m` is even, which is necessary for both `a` and `r` to be integers.
- `n - m >= 0` ensures that `r` is non-negative.

However, the program has a logical flaw. It should also check if `(n + m) % 2 == 0` to ensure that `a` is non-negative. If `n + m` is odd, then `a` would not be an integer, and the program would incorrectly output 'Yes' in some cases.

To fix this, the condition should be:
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0` and `(n + m) % 2 == 0`.

Given the current implementation, it does not check `(n + m) % 2 == 0`, which can lead to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
