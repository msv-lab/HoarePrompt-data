Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `x < k - 1` Case:**
   - The program checks if `a >= x + 1` when `x < k - 1`. This is incorrect because it does not consider the actual strategy needed to ensure Sasha can always win any number of coins. The correct condition should be `a >= x + 1` to ensure he can cover the maximum number of consecutive losses, but this alone is not sufficient to guarantee that he can win any number of coins.

2. **Incorrect Handling of `x == k - 1` Case:**
   - The program checks if `a >= x + 3` when `x == k - 1`. This is also incorrect. The correct condition should be `a >= x + 1` because if `x == k - 1`, Sasha can cover the maximum number of consecutive losses and still have a chance to win.

3. **Incorrect Handling of `x > k - 1` Case:**
   - The program uses a loop to calculate `z` which is supposed to represent the number of coins Sasha needs to start with to guarantee he can win any number of coins. However, the loop logic is flawed. The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to start with to cover the maximum number of consecutive losses and still have a chance to win.

### Correct Solution:

To solve the problem correctly, we need to ensure that Sasha can always recover from the maximum number of consecutive losses and still have a chance to win. The key insight is that if Sasha can cover `x` consecutive losses, he can always recover and win any number of coins.

Here is the correct logic:

- If `a >= x + 1`, then Sasha can always cover the maximum number of consecutive losses and still have a chance to win. This is because he can place bets of 1 coin each time he loses, and he will have enough coins to cover `x` losses and still have 1 coin left to place a bet and potentially win.

- If `a < x + 1`, then Sasha cannot cover the maximum number of consecutive losses, and he will not be able to guarantee winning any number of coins.

### Correct Program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= x + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This program correctly checks if Sasha has enough initial coins to cover the maximum number of consecutive losses and still have a chance to win. If `a >= x + 1`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
