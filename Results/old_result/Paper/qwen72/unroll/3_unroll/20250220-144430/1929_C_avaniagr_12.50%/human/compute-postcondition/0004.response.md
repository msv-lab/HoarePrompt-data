Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input. It then checks certain conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program remains unchanged except for the output produced. **
