The function `func` does not explicitly list the parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters: `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `k`, `x`, and `a` are integers where:
  - 2 <= k <= 30,
  - 1 <= x <= 100,
  - 1 <= a <= 10^9.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. Given the typical structure of such functions, it is likely that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `k`, `x`, and `a` for each test case. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`.**
