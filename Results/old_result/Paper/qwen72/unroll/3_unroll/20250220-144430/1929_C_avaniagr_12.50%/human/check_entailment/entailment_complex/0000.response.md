### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of `y` coins, and if he wins, he gets `y * k` coins (his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`). If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.
   - The goal is to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
     - If `x` is less than `k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from a series of losses because he can place a bet of 1 coin after each loss. This is because the maximum number of consecutive losses is less than the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win.
     - Therefore, if `a` is at least `x + 1`, Sasha can guarantee that he will eventually have any number of coins he wants.
     - If `a` is less than `x + 1`, he cannot guarantee this.

   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
     - If `x` is exactly `k - 1`, Sasha can still recover from a series of losses, but he needs a bit more initial coins to ensure he can always place a bet after `x` losses.
     - Specifically, if `a` is at least `x + 3`, he can guarantee that he will eventually have any number of coins he wants.
     - If `a` is less than `x + 3`, he cannot guarantee this.

   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
     - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, Sasha can still recover from a series of losses, but the strategy becomes more complex.
     - The function calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee that he can always recover from any sequence of losses.
     - The loop calculates `z` by repeatedly adding `z // (k - 1) + 1` to `z` for `x + 1` iterations. This is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins.
     - If `a` is at least `z`, Sasha can guarantee that he will eventually have any number of coins he wants.
     - If `a` is less than `z`, he cannot guarantee this.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1` is correct. Sasha can indeed guarantee winning any number of coins if he has enough initial coins.
   - The logic for `x > k - 1` is more complex, but the loop correctly simulates the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses `x` times in a row and then wins. The value `z` is calculated correctly to represent the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery.

4. **Output and State:**
   - The function correctly prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions.
   - The state of the program remains unchanged after the function call, as expected.
