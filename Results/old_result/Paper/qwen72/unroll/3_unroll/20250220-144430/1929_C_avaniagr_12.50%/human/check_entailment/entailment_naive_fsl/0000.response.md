Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
2 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Explanation:**
For the input `k = 2`, `x = 2`, and `a = 2`, the program should output "YES" because Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins. Here's a strategy that works:

1. Sasha bets 1 coin.
2. If he wins, he has 3 coins. He can then bet 1 coin again, and if he wins, he will have 4 coins.
3. If he loses, he has 1 coin left. He can then bet 1 coin again, and if he wins, he will have 2 coins. He can repeat this process until he wins.

Since Sasha cannot lose more than 2 times in a row, he can always recover and eventually win any number of coins. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case. This indicates that the program does not correctly handle the logic for all possible inputs.
