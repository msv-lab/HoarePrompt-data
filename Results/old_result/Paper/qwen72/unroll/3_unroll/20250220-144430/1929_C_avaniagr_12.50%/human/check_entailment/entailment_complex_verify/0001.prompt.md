You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend the best handbag, but unfortunately for
Sasha, it is very expensive. Therefore, Sasha wants to earn it. After looking
at earning tips on the internet, he decided to go to the casino.

Sasha knows that the casino operates under the following rules. If Sasha
places a bet of y coins (where y is a positive integer), then in case of
winning, he will receive y \cdot k coins (i.e., his number of coins will
increase by y \cdot (k - 1) ). And in case of losing, he will lose the entire
bet amount (i.e., his number of coins will decrease by y ).

Note that the bet amount must always be a positive (> 0 ) integer and cannot
exceed Sasha's current number of coins.

Sasha also knows that there is a promotion at the casino: he cannot lose more
than x times in a row.

Initially, Sasha has a coins. He wonders whether he can place bets such that
he is guaranteed to win any number of coins. In other words, is it true that
for any integer n , Sasha can make bets so that for any outcome that does not
contradict the rules described above, at some moment of time he will have at
least n coins.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The single line of each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 \leq k
\leq 30 , 1 \leq x \leq 100 , 1 \leq a \leq 10^9 ) — the number of times the
bet is increased in case of a win, the maximum number of consecutive losses,
and the initial number of coins Sasha has.

Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if Sasha can achieve it and
"NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, the strings "yEs",
"yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, Sasha can proceed as follows:

  * If Sasha places a bet for the first time or if he won the previous bet, then he places 1 coin.
  * If Sasha lost the previous bet, then he places 2 coins.

Note that Sasha cannot lose more than once in a row.

It can be proven that with this strategy, Sasha can obtain as many coins as he
wants.

In the second test case, Sasha can only place 1 coin for the first time. But
in case of a loss, he will not be able to place any more bets, so he will not
be able to guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

    #State: The values of `t`, `k`, `x`, and `a` remain unchanged, but the loop has printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a` from the input. It then checks certain conditions based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the state of the program remains unchanged except for the output produced.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place bets in a casino where a win multiplies his bet by \( k \) and a loss decreases his coins by the bet amount.
   - The casino has a promotion where Sasha cannot lose more than \( x \) times in a row.
   - Sasha starts with \( a \) coins and wants to determine if he can guarantee having at least \( n \) coins for any integer \( n \).

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can always recover from \( x \) consecutive losses because each win will multiply the bet by \( k \), which is more than the number of losses he can have in a row.
   - If \( x \geq k - 1 \), the strategy becomes more complex because the number of consecutive losses can be significant, and Sasha needs to ensure he has enough coins to recover.

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \).
   - The program then checks three conditions:
     - **If \( x < k - 1 \):**
       - If \( a \geq x + 1 \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - **If \( x == k - 1 \):**
       - If \( a \geq x + 3 \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
     - **If \( x > k - 1 \):**
       - It calculates \( z \) using a loop where \( z \) is incremented by \( z // (k - 1) + 1 \) for \( x + 1 \) iterations.
       - If \( a \geq z \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Evaluating the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: \( x < k - 1 \)**
     - This condition is correct because if \( x < k - 1 \), Sasha can always recover from \( x \) consecutive losses. The minimum number of coins he needs to start with is \( x + 1 \) to ensure he can place bets without running out of coins.
   - **Condition 2: \( x == k - 1 \)**
     - This condition is incorrect. The program checks if \( a \geq x + 3 \), but this is not the correct threshold. Sasha can still recover with fewer coins if he has a good strategy.
   - **Condition 3: \( x > k - 1 \)**
     - The loop to calculate \( z \) is incorrect. The logic \( z += z // (k - 1) + 1 \) does not accurately represent the number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee a win. The correct approach should involve a more detailed calculation or a different strategy to ensure he can recover from \( x \) consecutive losses.

5. **Correct Strategy:**
   - For \( x < k - 1 \), the condition \( a \geq x + 1 \) is correct.
   - For \( x \geq k - 1 \), the correct approach is to calculate the minimum number of coins Sasha needs to guarantee a win. This can be done by considering the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses \( x \) times in a row and then wins once. The minimum number of coins needed can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{min\_coins} = \sum_{i=0}^{x} \left\lceil \frac{a}{k^i} \right\rceil
     \]
   - If \( a \geq \text{min\_coins} \), Sasha can guarantee a win; otherwise, he cannot.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has incorrect logic in the second and third conditions, which can lead to incorrect outputs for certain test cases. Specifically, the threshold for \( x == k - 1 \) and the loop for \( x > k - 1 \) do not accurately represent the minimum number of coins needed to guarantee a win.
