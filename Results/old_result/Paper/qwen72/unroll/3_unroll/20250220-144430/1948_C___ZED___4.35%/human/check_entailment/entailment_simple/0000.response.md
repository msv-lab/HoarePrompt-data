### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The function checks if the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>'. If this is the case, it prints 'NO' because the robot cannot move to the last column of the second row if the second-to-last cell in the second row points to the left.
   - This check is valid because if `b[-2]` is not '>', the robot will be unable to move to the final cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Edge Case for n == 1:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1 and prints 'YES' if true. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem constraints specify that `n` is always even and at least 2. Therefore, `n == 1` will never occur in valid input.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The function then checks if there is a path from the start to the end of the grid by examining the characters in the strings `a` and `b`.
   - It first checks if there is any cell in the second row `b` (at even indices) that does not point to the right. If such a cell exists, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after this check, it then checks if there is any cell in the first row `a` (at odd indices) that does not point to the right. If such a cell exists, it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.
   - If `no_path` is `False` after both checks, it prints 'NO', indicating that the robot cannot reach the cell `(2, n)`.

### Issues:
- **Edge Case for n == 1:** The check `if n == 1` is redundant and can be removed since `n` is always at least 2 and even.
- **Path Checking Logic:** The logic for checking the path is flawed. The function should not reset `no_path` to `True` after the first check. Instead, it should continue to the second check only if the first check passes. If either check fails, it should immediately print 'NO'.

### Corrected Logic:
- The function should check if `b[-2]` is not '>'. If it is not, print 'NO'.
- If `b[-2]` is '>', it should then check if there is any cell in the second row `b` (at even indices) that does not point to the right. If such a cell exists, print 'NO'.
- If no such cell exists, it should then check if there is any cell in the first row `a` (at odd indices) that does not point to the right. If such a cell exists, print 'NO'.
- If both checks pass, print 'YES'.

### Correctness:
- The current program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the path checking and the unnecessary edge case check for `n == 1`.

### Correctness: **False**
