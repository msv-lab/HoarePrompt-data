Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of `b` is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the start to the end of the grid by examining the characters in the strings `a` and `b`. If no valid path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated for each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not specified as they depend on the input. The loop completes all iterations, and the function ends. **
