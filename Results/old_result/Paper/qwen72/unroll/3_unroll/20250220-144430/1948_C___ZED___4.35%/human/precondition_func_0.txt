The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n[i] consisting of characters '<' and '>'. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n[i] is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all n[i] does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The strings represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, and no arrow points outside the grid.
