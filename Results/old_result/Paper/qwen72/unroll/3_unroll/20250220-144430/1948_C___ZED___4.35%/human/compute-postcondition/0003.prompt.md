You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of integers n, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains two strings of length n[i] consisting of characters '<' and '>'. t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each n[i] is an even integer such that 2 ≤ n[i] ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the sum of all n[i] does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The strings represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, and no arrow points outside the grid.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reading the integer n and the two strings a and b for each case. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last character of b is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If n is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the start to the end of the grid by examining the characters in the strings a and b. If no path is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The variables t, n, a, and b are updated for each iteration, but their final values after the loop are not specified as they depend on the input. The loop completes all iterations, and the function ends.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t`, a list of integers `n`, and a list of tuples containing two strings of length `n[i]` consisting of characters '<' and '>'. It returns the number of cells where the arrows from the first and second rows point towards each other.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
