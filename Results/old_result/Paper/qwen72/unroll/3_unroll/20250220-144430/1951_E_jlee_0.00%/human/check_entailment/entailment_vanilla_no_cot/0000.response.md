Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Single Character Strings**: The program correctly handles strings of length 1 by printing "NO". This is correct because a single character is always a palindrome.

2. **Strings with All Characters the Same**: The program correctly handles strings where all characters are the same (e.g., "lllllllll") by printing "NO". This is correct because any substring of such a string is a palindrome.

3. **Strings with One Different Character**: The program attempts to handle strings where all but one character are the same (e.g., "aaabaaa"). However, it has a logical error in the condition `if n % 2 == 1 and s[(n - 1) // 2] != x:`. This condition is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. For example, for the string "aaabaaa", the program will print "NO" even though a valid partition exists (e.g., "aaab" and "aaa").

4. **General Case Handling**: The program's logic for handling general cases is overly complex and contains multiple nested conditions that are not necessary. The program should be simplified to handle the general case more effectively.

### Simplified Correct Solution

Here is a simplified and correct solution for the problem:

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        string = input()
        n = len(string)
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        if not is_palindrome(string):
            print('YES')
            print(1)
            print(string)
            continue
        
        # Try to partition the string into two non-palindromic parts
        for i in range(1, n):
            if not is_palindrome(string[:i]) and not is_palindrome(string[i:]):
                print('YES')
                print(2)
                print(string[:i], string[i:])
                break
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation

1. **Single Character Strings**: If the string length is 1, print "NO" because a single character is a palindrome.
2. **Non-Palindromic Strings**: If the entire string is not a palindrome, print "YES" with the entire string as the only part.
3. **Partitioning**: If the string is a palindrome, try to partition it into two non-palindromic parts. Iterate through possible partition points and check if both parts are non-palindromic. If found, print "YES" with the partition. If no such partition is found, print "NO".

This solution is more straightforward and correctly handles all the cases described in the problem.
