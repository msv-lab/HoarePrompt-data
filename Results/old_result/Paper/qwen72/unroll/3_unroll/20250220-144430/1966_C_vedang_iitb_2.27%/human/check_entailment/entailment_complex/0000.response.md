### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they remove a positive integer \( k \) from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses.
   - Alice goes first, and both players play optimally.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Input**: A list `a` of positive integers.
   - **Output**: A new list `a_new` where the first element is the smallest unique element from `a`, and each subsequent element at index `i` (for `i > 0`) is the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in the sorted list of unique elements of `a`.
   - **Purpose**: This function transforms the list of pile sizes into a form that simplifies the game analysis. By sorting and taking differences, it effectively reduces the problem to a simpler form where the smallest pile size is 1, and the differences represent the remaining stones in the piles after the smallest pile is considered.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Input**: A list `a` of positive integers and a positive integer `n`.
   - **Output**: Returns 1 if Alice wins and 2 if Bob wins.
   - **Purpose**: This function determines the winner of the game using a recursive approach.
   - **Base Cases**:
     - If `n` is 1, Alice wins because she can always remove the single pile.
     - If `n` is 2, Alice wins if the first element of `a` is even (since she can remove an even number of stones and leave Bob with an odd number, forcing Bob to lose on his next turn). Otherwise, Bob wins.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - The function recursively calls itself with the list `a` excluding the first element and `n` decremented by 1.
     - If the recursive call returns 2 (indicating Bob wins the subgame), or if the recursive call returns 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, Alice wins.
     - Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The transformation in `func_1` is correct because it simplifies the problem by reducing the pile sizes to a form where the smallest pile size is 1, and the differences represent the remaining stones.
   - The recursive logic in `func_2` is correct because it correctly handles the base cases and the recursive step. The base cases ensure that the function works for the simplest scenarios, and the recursive step correctly simulates the game by considering the optimal moves for both players.
   - The program correctly prints the winner for each test case based on the output of `func_2`.
