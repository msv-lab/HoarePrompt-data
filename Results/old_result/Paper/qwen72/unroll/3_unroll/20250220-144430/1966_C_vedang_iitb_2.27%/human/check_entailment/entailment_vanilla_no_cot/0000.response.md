Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function sorts the unique elements of the list and then computes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - However, this transformation does not preserve the game state in a way that is useful for determining the winner. The game involves removing the same number of stones from each nonempty pile, and the transformation in `func_1` does not reflect this.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to determine the winner recursively.
   - The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are correct:
     - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can remove all stones.
     - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), Alice wins if the number of stones in the smallest pile is even, and Bob wins if it is odd.
   - However, the recursive case is flawed. The function `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` is supposed to determine the winner for the remaining piles after the first move, but it does not correctly handle the game dynamics. Specifically, it does not consider the optimal moves that both players can make.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the concept of the Nim game, which is a well-known game theory problem. The key insight is that the game can be reduced to a Nim game where the number of stones in each pile is the size of the pile modulo the smallest pile size.

Here is a correct solution:

```python
def nim_winner(a):
    # Find the smallest pile size
    min_pile = min(a)
    
    # Compute the XOR of all pile sizes modulo the smallest pile size
    xor_sum = 0
    for pile in a:
        xor_sum ^= (pile % min_pile)
    
    # If the XOR sum is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins
    if xor_sum != 0:
        return "Alice"
    else:
        return "Bob"

# Main function to handle multiple test cases
def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(nim_winner(a))

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation of the Correct Solution:

1. **Finding the Smallest Pile**:
   - The smallest pile size is found using `min(a)`.
   - This is because the players can only remove up to the smallest pile size in each move.

2. **Computing the XOR Sum**:
   - The XOR sum of the pile sizes modulo the smallest pile size is computed.
   - This is a standard technique in the Nim game to determine the winner. If the XOR sum is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the second player (Bob) has a winning strategy.

3. **Output**:
   - The function `nim_winner` returns "Alice" if the XOR sum is non-zero and "Bob" otherwise.
   - The `main` function handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each case.

This approach correctly determines the winner based on the game rules and optimal play.
