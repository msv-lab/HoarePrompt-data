The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a` and `n`. `a` is a list of positive integers where the length of `a` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5, inclusive. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a). The function returns either the integer 1 or the integer 2 based on certain conditions that are not specified in the given information. However, since all cases return either 1 or 2, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and a positive integer `n` where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= n <= len(a). It returns either the integer 1 or the integer 2.**
