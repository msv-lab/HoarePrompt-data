The code snippet `winNext = func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` has the following impact:

- `a[1:]` creates a new list that is a slice of `a` starting from the second element to the end. This means the first element of `a` is removed, and the new list contains the remaining elements.
- `n - 1` decreases the value of `n` by 1.
- `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)` is called with the new list and the new value of `n - 1`. The result of this function call is assigned to `winNext`.

The initial state is:
- `a` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(a).
- `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` is not equal to 2.

After the code execution:
- `a` remains a list of positive integers with the same length as before, but the first element is removed.
- `n` is now `n - 1`, which is still a positive integer.
- `winNext` holds the result of the function call `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers with length `len(a) - 1`, `n` is `n - 1`, `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`, and `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= `len(a) - 1`.**
