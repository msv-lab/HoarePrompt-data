You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the user. It calculates and returns the difference between the position of the last occurrence of 'B' and the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, it returns 2. The function does not use or modify any external parameters or lists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `n`. It then iterates over these test cases, calling `func_1()` for each one and printing the result.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. Inside this function:
   - It reads the length of the strip `m` and the string `s` representing the strip.
   - It initializes variables `c` and `d` to 0, which will be used to find the positions of the first and last black cells, respectively.
   - It initializes an empty list `l`, but this list is not used in the function, so it can be considered redundant.

3. **Finding the First Black Cell**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` from left to right.
   - It increments `c` for each cell and checks if the cell is 'B'.
   - When it finds the first 'B', it sets `mi` to `c` and breaks out of the loop.
   - `mi` will now hold the position of the first black cell.

4. **Finding the Last Black Cell**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` from right to left.
   - It increments `d` for each cell and checks if the cell is 'B'.
   - When it finds the last 'B', it sets `ma` to `len(s) - d` and breaks out of the loop.
   - `ma` will now hold the position of the last black cell.

5. **Calculating the Minimum Segment Length**:
   - The program returns `ma - mi + 2` as the result.
   - This formula is intended to calculate the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the strip consists of only one black cell, both `mi` and `ma` will be the same, and the formula `ma - mi + 2` will correctly return 1.
   - If the strip has no black cells, the problem guarantees that at least one cell is black, so this case is not possible.

7. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `ma - mi + 2` should actually be `ma - mi + 1` to correctly calculate the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, inclusive.
   - The current formula adds an extra 1, which is incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it adds an extra 1 in the formula to calculate the segment length.
