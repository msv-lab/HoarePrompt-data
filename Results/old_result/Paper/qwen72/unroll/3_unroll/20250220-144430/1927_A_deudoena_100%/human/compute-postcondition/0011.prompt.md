You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, each containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in each string is black.
def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found), `d` is 0, `ma` is 0, `mi` is the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `t` is the input integer, `l` is an empty list.
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
        
    #State: `c` is the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found), `d` is the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` (or the length of `s` if 'B' is not found) plus 1, `ma` is the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `mi` is the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` (or 0 if 'B' is not found), `m` is the input integer, `s` is the input string, `t` is the input integer, `l` is an empty list.
    return ma - mi + 2
    #The program returns the difference between the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` and the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, the program returns 2.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` with characters 'W' and 'B'. It returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the first 'B' in `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, it returns 2.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the position of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s` and the position of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, plus 2. If 'B' is not found in `s`, the program returns 2.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
