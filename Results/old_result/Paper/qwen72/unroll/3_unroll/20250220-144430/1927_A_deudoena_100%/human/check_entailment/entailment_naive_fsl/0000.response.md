Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the entire strip is already white. According to the problem description, the function should return the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white to make the entire strip white. If the strip is already all white, the correct output should be 0 (since no painting is needed). However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario and will return an incorrect value.

For example, if the input is:
```
1
3
WWW
```
The program will incorrectly return 2 instead of 0.
