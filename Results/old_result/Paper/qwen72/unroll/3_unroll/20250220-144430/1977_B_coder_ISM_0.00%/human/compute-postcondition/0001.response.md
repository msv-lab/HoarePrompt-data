The only objects in the loop head are the variables `nalla` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `x` is not part of the loop head and therefore does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x < 2^30, `t` must be greater than 0, `nalla` is 0**
