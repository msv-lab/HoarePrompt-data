The function `func_1` should accept a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of strings, where each string `s` in `test_cases` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string `s` is between 1 and 5000 characters. The total length of all strings in `test_cases` does not exceed 5000.

Since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, it is assumed that the function is intended to process `test_cases` but is missing the parameter in its definition. The function's output is not specified, but typically, such a function would return a result based on the processing of the `test_cases`.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept a list of strings `test_cases`, where each string `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 characters. The total length of all strings in `test_cases` does not exceed 5000. The function's return value is not specified, but it is expected to process the `test_cases` and return a result based on this processing.**
