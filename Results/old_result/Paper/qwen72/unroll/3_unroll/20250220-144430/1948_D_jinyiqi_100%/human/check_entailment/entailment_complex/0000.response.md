Reasoning:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. However, the function `func_1` is called without any arguments, which is incorrect because the function needs to process the input string `s` for each test case.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined without any parameters. This is a mistake because the function should take the string `s` as an argument. The function should be defined as `def func_1(s):` to properly handle the input string for each test case.

3. **String Processing**: Inside `func_1`, the string `s` is converted to a list, which is not necessary for the problem but does not affect the correctness. The function then iterates over possible lengths of the tandem repeat, starting from the largest possible half-length down to 1. This approach is correct because it ensures that the function finds the longest possible tandem repeat.

4. **Tandem Repeat Check**: The inner loop checks if the characters at positions `k` and `k + j` are either both question marks, both the same character, or one of them is a question mark. If any of these conditions are met, it increments the `count`. This is a correct approach to identify potential tandem repeats.

5. **Output and Return**: If the `count` reaches `j`, it means a tandem repeat of length `2 * j` has been found, and the function prints `count * 2` and returns. If no tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, the function prints `0`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where no tandem repeat can be formed, printing `0`.

However, the function call in the main loop should pass the string `s` to `func_1`. The corrected version of the main loop should be:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    s = input()
    func_1(s)
```

Given the above points, the program is almost correct but has a minor issue with the function call. If we assume that the function call is corrected as shown, the program would be correct.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the function call issue. If the function call is corrected, the program would be correct.
