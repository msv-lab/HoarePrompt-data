The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin in the format specified in the problem description. The input consists of multiple test cases, where the first line is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) indicating the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of the strings over all test cases does not exceed 5000.
