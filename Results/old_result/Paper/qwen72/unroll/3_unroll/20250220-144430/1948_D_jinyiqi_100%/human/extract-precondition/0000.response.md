Precondition: **The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a string `s` and multiple test cases, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include a parameter for the list of strings or test cases. Assuming the function should take a list of strings as input, the precondition would be: `test_cases is a list of strings, where each string s in test_cases consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and 1 <= len(s) <= 5000. The total length of all strings in test_cases does not exceed 5000.`**
