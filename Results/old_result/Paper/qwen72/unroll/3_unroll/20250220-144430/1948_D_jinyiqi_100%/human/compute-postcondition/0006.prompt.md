You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is intended to solve a problem involving a string `s` and multiple test cases, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include a parameter for the list of strings or test cases. Assuming the function should take a list of strings as input, the precondition would be: `test_cases is a list of strings, where each string s in test_cases consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and 1 <= len(s) <= 5000. The total length of all strings in test_cases does not exceed 5000.`
def func_1():
    s = list(input())
    n = len(s)
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: The loop does not modify the variables `test_cases`, `s`, or `n`. The loop may print a value `count * 2` if a specific condition is met, but the variables `test_cases`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
    print(0)
    #This is printed: 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function is intended to accept a list of strings `test_cases`, where each string `s` consists only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of each string is between 1 and 5000 characters. The total length of all strings in `test_cases` does not exceed 5000. The function's return value is not specified, but it is expected to process the `test_cases` and return a result based on this processing.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
