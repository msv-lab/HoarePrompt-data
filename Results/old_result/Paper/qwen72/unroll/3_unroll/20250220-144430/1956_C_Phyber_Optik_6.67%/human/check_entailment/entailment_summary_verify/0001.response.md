### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The maximum sum is achieved when each element in the matrix is the largest possible value, which is \( n \).
   - Therefore, the maximum sum is \( n \times n \times n = n^3 \).

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we can perform \( n \) Type 1 operations, each filling a row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - After filling all rows, the matrix will have each row as \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - Then, we can perform \( n \) Type 2 operations, each filling a column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - After these operations, each element in the matrix will be \( n \), and the sum will be \( n^3 \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to \( n \) and calculates the sum based on a condition that is not directly related to the problem's goal of maximizing the sum.
   - The condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum. This condition is used to calculate the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The program prints the sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations, which are not correctly structured to achieve the maximum sum. The operations are not filling the matrix with the maximum possible values.

4. **Issues in the Program**:
   - The sum calculation logic is incorrect. It should be \( n^3 \) for the maximum sum.
   - The number of operations \( n + r \) is not necessarily the correct number of operations to achieve the maximum sum.
   - The operations printed are not structured to fill the matrix with the maximum possible values.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not provide the correct sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum. The logic for sum calculation and the number of operations is flawed, and the operations printed do not follow the correct format to maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
