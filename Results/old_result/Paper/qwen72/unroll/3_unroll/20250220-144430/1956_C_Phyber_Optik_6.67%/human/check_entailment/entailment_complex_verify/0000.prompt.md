You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any input parameters, but it is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the size of the matrix. The number of test cases t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500).

    t = int(input())

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop will read an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) from the user. After the loop finishes, the variables `sum` and `r` will be calculated and printed for each test case. The variable `sum` will be the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The variable `r` will be the last value of `i` that satisfies the condition. Additionally, for each test case, the loop will print a series of lines where the first line is `sum` and `n + r`, followed by `n + r` lines. The first `n` lines will print `1` followed by the line number and the range from 1 to `n`. The remaining lines will print `2` followed by the line number modulo `n` and the range from 1 to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) from the user, representing the size of a matrix. The function calculates and prints two values: `sum` and `n + r`. The variable `sum` is the sum of either `n * (n + 1) // 2` or `i * n` for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`, depending on the condition `n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n`. The variable `r` is the last value of `i` that satisfies this condition. After printing `sum` and `n + r`, the function prints `n + r` lines. The first `n` lines each start with `1` followed by the line number and the range from 1 to `n`. The remaining lines each start with `2` followed by the line number modulo `n` and the range from 1 to `n`. The function repeats this process for each of the `t` test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of operations and the sum is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1
1 1 1
9 3
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 1 2 3
1 3 1 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1 1
1 1 1
10 4
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 1 2 3
1 3 1 2 3
2 1 1 2 3
```

For the case `n = 3`, the program outputs a sum of 10 with 4 operations, which is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for a 3x3 matrix is 9, and it can be achieved with exactly 3 operations as shown in the expected output. The program incorrectly calculates the sum and the number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
