Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix for all cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the number of operations and the sum is flawed. Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
2
1
3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1 1
1 1 1
9 3
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 1 2 3
1 3 1 2 3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1 1
1 1 1
10 4
1 1 1 2 3
1 2 1 2 3
1 3 1 2 3
2 1 1 2 3
```

For the case `n = 3`, the program outputs a sum of 10 with 4 operations, which is incorrect. The correct maximum sum for a 3x3 matrix is 9, and it can be achieved with exactly 3 operations as shown in the expected output. The program incorrectly calculates the sum and the number of operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.
