You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:

from typing import List

if __name__ == '__main__':

    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())

                if chr(c) not in mapping.values():
                    mapping[chr(c)] = char

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by a unique lowercase Latin letter. The replacement is based on a mapping that is dynamically created during the function's execution, ensuring that each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a different lowercase Latin letter. The final state of the program includes a dictionary `mapping` that maps each unique character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase Latin letter, and the returned string `decoded` where each character in `encoded` has been replaced by its corresponding mapped letter.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. The issue lies in the logic used to create the `mapping` dictionary. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string by reversing the encoding process, but it incorrectly maps characters in the encoded string to their corresponding characters in the auxiliary string `r` in a way that does not follow the symmetric replacement rule.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```
The expected output is "codeforces". However, the program will output a different string because it incorrectly maps characters in the encoded string to characters in the auxiliary string `r` without considering the symmetric replacement rule.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Constructing the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
2. Creating a symmetric mapping based on `r`.
3. Using this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The current implementation does not handle these steps correctly, leading to incorrect decoding.
