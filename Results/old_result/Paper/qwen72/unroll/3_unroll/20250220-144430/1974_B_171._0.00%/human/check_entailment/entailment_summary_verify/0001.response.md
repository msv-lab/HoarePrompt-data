Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `num_cases` and processes each test case by reading the length of the encoded string `n` and the encoded string `encoded`.
   - This part of the program is accurate and follows the problem description.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to decode the encoded string `encoded`.
   - The function uses a dictionary `mapping` to store the mapping from encoded characters to their corresponding decoded characters.
   - The program iterates over each character in the encoded string `encoded`.
   - If the character is already in the `mapping`, it appends the corresponding decoded character to the `decoded` list.
   - If the character is not in the `mapping`, it iterates over all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' to find a letter that is not yet in the `mapping` values. It then maps this letter to the current character and appends the letter to the `decoded` list.

3. **Mapping and Decoding**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic for finding the symmetric character in the auxiliary string `r` is incorrect.
   - The current implementation does not construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
   - Instead, it maps each character in `encoded` to a unique lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z', which does not follow the problem's requirement of symmetric mapping.
   - The correct approach should involve constructing the auxiliary string `r` and then mapping each character in `encoded` to its symmetric character in `r`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters of the encoded string, sorted alphabetically.
   - Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
   - Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaw in the logic.

Final: **False**
