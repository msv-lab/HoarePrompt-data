Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reads the size of the array `n`, and the elements of the array. It then processes the array to find two minimum values `x` and `y` and counts the number of elements that are greater than both `x` and `y`. The final output is the count of such elements for each test case. The variables `x` and `y` are reset to `n + 1` for each new test case, and `ans` is reset to 0. After all iterations, the function prints the value of `ans` for each test case.**
