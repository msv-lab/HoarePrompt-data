The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n` from the input. It processes the array to generate a list `mex` of integers based on the values in `a`. For each positive element in `a`, it appends the current value of `minn` to `mex` and increments `minn`. If `minn` equals `maxx`, `minn` is set to `maxx + 1`. For each non-positive element in `a`, it appends the absolute difference between the element and `minn` to `mex`, and updates `maxx` if this difference exceeds the current `maxx`. Finally, it prints the elements of `mex` separated by spaces, followed by a newline. The function does not return any value.
