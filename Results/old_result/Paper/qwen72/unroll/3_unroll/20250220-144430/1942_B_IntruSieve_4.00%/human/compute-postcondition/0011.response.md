The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and an array `a` of length `n` with elements `a_i` (-n ≤ a_i ≤ n). The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the given data. The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. It returns a result based on the given test cases, ensuring that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5 and that there is at least one valid permutation `p` for the data.**
