The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the result of `isqrt(x)`. The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `isqrt(x) + 1` contains at least one value. This means `isqrt(x) + 1` must be greater than 1, or equivalently, `isqrt(x)` must be at least 1. Since `isqrt(x)` is the integer square root of `x`, it will be at least 1 if `x` is at least 1. Given that `1 <= n <= x` is still valid, `x` must be at least 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `x` must be at least 1, and `i` should start at 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that x >= 1, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1**
