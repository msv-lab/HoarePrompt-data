To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which in this case is the variable `f` and the list `F`. The loop will execute if `F` is not empty (i.e., it contains at least one element).

Given the initial state:
- `A` remains the list returned by `func_4()`
- `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the values returned by `func_4()`
- `D` remains a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()` where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9
- `F` remains the list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9
- `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`
- `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`
- `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the maximum difference occurs
- `left` is `A[index - 1]`
- `right` is `A[index]`
- `ans` is equal to `max_diff`

We need to adjust the state to ensure that `F` is not empty and that `f` is the first element in `F`.

State: **`A` remains the list returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` remains a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()` where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9, `F` is a list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9 and must have at least 1 element, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the maximum difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`, `f` is the first element in `F`**
