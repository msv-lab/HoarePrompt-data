The only objects in the loop head are the variables `_` and `testcases`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be greater than 0. Since no variables are passed to the function `func_7`, and `testcases` is the value returned by `func_3()`, we need to ensure that `func_3()` returns a value greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0, `_` is not relevant**
