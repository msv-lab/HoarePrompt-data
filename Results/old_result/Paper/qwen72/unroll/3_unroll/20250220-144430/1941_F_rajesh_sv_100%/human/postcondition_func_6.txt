The function `func_6` takes no parameters and returns no value. It operates on three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and three lists `A`, `D`, and `F` that are provided by the `func_4` function. The function identifies the maximum and second maximum differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `A`. It then calculates a new value `ans` by finding the minimum of the maximum differences between the adjusted elements of `D` and the elements `left` and `right` from `A` (where `left` and `right` are the elements around the maximum difference in `A`). Finally, it prints the maximum of `ans` and `next_max_diff`. The state of `A`, `D`, and `F` remains unchanged, and the function does not modify any global variables or have any side effects other than printing the result.
