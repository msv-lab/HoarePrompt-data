Output State: **`A` remains the list returned by `func_4()`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain the values returned by `func_4()`, `D` remains a sorted list of unique integers derived from the list returned by `func_4()` where 1 <= D[i] <= 10^9, `F` remains the list of `k` integers where 1 <= F[i] <= 10^9, `max_diff` is the maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the element in `A` where the maximum difference occurs, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`, `ans` is equal to `max_diff`.**
