### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of `n` integers.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function initializes a list `cntl` of size `n + 1` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. This is appropriate because the integers in `a` are in the range `[0, n-1]`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - If there are no zeros in the list `a`, the function immediately prints `0` because the MEX of any list that does not contain `0` is `0`.
   - If there are zeros in the list, the function initializes `c` to the minimum of `2` and the count of `0`s in `a`. This is because Alice and Bob can each pick at most one `0` during the game.
   - The function then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n` and checks if the count of each integer is less than `2`. If it finds such an integer, it decreases `c` by `1` and checks if `c` is `0` or if the current integer is `n`. If either condition is true, it prints the current integer `j` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The function's logic ensures that Alice and Bob play optimally by considering the counts of each integer and the constraints of the game.
   - The function correctly identifies the smallest integer `j` that is not present in the list `c` after both players have played optimally.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where there are no zeros in the list by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where all integers are present at least twice by printing `n`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The program processes each test case as expected and prints the correct output for each case.

### Correctness:
**True**
