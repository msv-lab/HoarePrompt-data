### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns picking elements from an array `a` of size `n`. Alice appends the element to an array `c` and Bob just removes the element.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum EXcludant) of the array `c` at the end of the game, where both players play optimally.
   - Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to pick elements that are not already in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to pick elements that are already in `c` or elements that are not necessary to form a higher MEX.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program initializes a list `cntl` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `a`.
   - If there are no zeros in the array `a`, the MEX is `0` because `0` is the smallest non-negative integer.
   - If there are zeros, the program initializes a variable `c` to `min(2, cntl[0])`, which is either `0` or `1` depending on the count of zeros.
   - The program then iterates through the integers from `1` to `n` and checks if the count of each integer is less than `2`.
   - If the count of an integer `j` is less than `2`, it decrements `c` and checks if `c` is zero or if `j` is the last integer (`n`). If either condition is true, it prints `j` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such integer `j` is found, it prints `n`.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where there are no zeros in the array, printing `0` as the MEX.
   - The program correctly identifies the smallest integer `j` that has a count less than `2` and prints it, which is the optimal MEX value.
   - The logic of decrementing `c` and breaking the loop when `c` is zero or when `j` is the last integer ensures that the MEX is calculated correctly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where all elements are the same (e.g., `[1, 1]`), correctly printing `0` as the MEX.
   - The program also handles the case where the array is already a permutation of `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`, correctly printing `n` as the MEX.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. It handles all edge cases and follows the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob.

### Correctness:
**True**
