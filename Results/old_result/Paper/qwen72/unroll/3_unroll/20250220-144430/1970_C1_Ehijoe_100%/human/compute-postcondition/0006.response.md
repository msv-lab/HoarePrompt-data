Output State: **`n` and `t` remain unchanged, `edges` is still an empty list, `empty` is still `True`, `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as its default factory, and it now contains `n-1` edges where each key (node) has a list of connected nodes, `ends` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list `ends`, which is now an empty list. The other variables (`n`, `t`, `edges`, `empty`, and `nodes`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
