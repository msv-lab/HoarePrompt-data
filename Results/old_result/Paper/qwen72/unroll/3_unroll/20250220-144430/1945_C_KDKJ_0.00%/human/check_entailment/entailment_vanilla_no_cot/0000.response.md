Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the input for each test case.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the prefix sums for zeros and ones up to each house. This is done using the list `S`, where each element `[x, y]` represents the count of zeros and ones, respectively, up to the current house.

3. **Condition Checking**: The program iterates through each possible position to place the road (from 0 to n-1) and checks if the condition is satisfied:
   - For the left side, it ensures that the number of zeros is at least half of the total number of houses on the left side.
   - For the right side, it ensures that the number of ones is at least half of the total number of houses on the right side.

4. **Optimal Position Selection**: The program keeps track of the position that satisfies the condition and is closest to the middle of the village. It updates the answer if the current position is closer to the middle than the previously found position.

5. **Output**: The program prints the optimal position for each test case.

The logic and implementation align with the problem requirements, ensuring that the road is placed in a way that satisfies the conditions and is as close to the middle as possible. Therefore, the program is correct.
