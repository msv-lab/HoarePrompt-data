Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer from the user input, and for each integer value, it calls the function `func_1`. The function `func_2` does not modify any external variables or state. The final state of the program remains unchanged except for the side effects caused by the calls to `func_1`. **
