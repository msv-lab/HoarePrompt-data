The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`. 

- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `t` is an integer and always equals 1.
- `nodes` is a dictionary where each key is an integer representing a node, and each value is a list of integers representing the neighbors of that node.
- `start` is an integer such that 1 <= start <= n.

The function returns the list of neighbors of the node specified by `start`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `t`, `nodes`, and `start`, where `n` is the number of nodes, `t` is always 1, `nodes` is a dictionary representing a graph, and `start` is the starting node. It returns the list of neighbors of the node specified by `start`.**
