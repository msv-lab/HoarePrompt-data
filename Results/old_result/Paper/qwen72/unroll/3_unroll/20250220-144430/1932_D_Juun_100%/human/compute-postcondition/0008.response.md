Output State: **The `trumps` list will be empty if it had enough elements to pair with all non-None ranks in the `suits` dictionary. The `answers` list will contain strings representing pairs of cards, where each pair consists of a card from the `suits` dictionary and a card from the `trumps` list. If the `trumps` list did not have enough elements, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and terminate early. The `suits` dictionary will remain unchanged, except that the ranks of suits that were paired with a trump card will still be present but will not affect the loop's execution further.**
