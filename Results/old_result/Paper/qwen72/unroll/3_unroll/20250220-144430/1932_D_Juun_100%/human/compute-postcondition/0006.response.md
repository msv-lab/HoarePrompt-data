Output State: **The `trumps` list contains the ranks of all cards that have the suit equal to `trump`. The `answers` list contains strings representing pairs of cards that were compared and added to `answers` when a card of a non-trump suit was encountered and a previous card of the same suit was already in `suits`. The `suits` dictionary will have the last encountered rank for each suit that is not the `trump` suit, or `None` if no card of that suit was encountered after being set to a rank.**
