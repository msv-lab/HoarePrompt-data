### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine the number of natural numbers \( k \) that fit the given constraints for Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned follow a specific pattern: \( 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the result.
     - If \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \), it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the result.
   - `func_1(x)` finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.
   - The program then checks if the divisors plus 2 are even and if they are greater than or equal to \( x \). If so, it appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(x)` correctly finds all divisors of \( x \) by iterating up to the square root of \( x \).
   - It appends the divisors to `output1` and their corresponding pairs to `output2`.
   - It reverses `output1` and returns the combined list of divisors.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic checks if \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \) to determine if the position \( n \) and number \( x \) can fit into the settling pattern.
   - It then calls `func_1` for these values and processes the results to find valid \( k \) values.
   - The program correctly appends valid \( k \) values to the `output` list and removes duplicates.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - It also handles the constraints \( 1 \le x < n \le 10^9 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values for the given constraints. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to find divisors, and the main logic processes these divisors to determine valid \( k \) values. The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
