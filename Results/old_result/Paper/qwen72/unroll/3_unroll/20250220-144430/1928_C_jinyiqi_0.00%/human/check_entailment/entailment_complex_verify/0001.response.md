### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vasya is in a line of students, and he remembers his position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The pattern is: the first `k` positions are numbered `1` to `k`, the next `k - 2` positions are numbered `k - 1` to `2`, and this repeats.
   - The settling exists if and only if `k > 1`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `x`.
   - The output is the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 \leq t \leq 100`
   - `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`
   - `k > 1`

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given `n` and `x`, we need to find all `k` such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the pattern.
   - The position `n` in the pattern can be expressed as `n % (2k - 2)`.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is used to find all divisors of `x`.
   - The main logic checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n + x - 2` is even.
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n - x` is even.
   - For each condition, it finds the divisors of the respective value and checks if they can form a valid `k` by ensuring `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

6. **Function `func_1(x)`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(x)` to find divisors and appends both `i` and `x / i` to the output lists.
   - The lists are then combined and returned.
   - The function correctly identifies all divisors of `x`.

7. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `output` to store valid `k` values.
   - It checks if `n + x - 2` is even and finds its divisors using `func_1`.
   - It checks if `n - x` is even and finds its divisors using `func_1`.
   - For each divisor, it checks if it can form a valid `k` and appends it to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k = 1` is not valid.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1(x)`**:
  - The function correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
  - The divisors are found by iterating from `1` to `sqrt(x)` and checking if `x % i == 0`.
  - The divisors are stored in two lists, `output1` and `output2`, and then combined and returned.
  - The function ensures that all divisors are included, and the structure of the list is correct.

- **Main Logic**:
  - The program checks if `n + x - 2` is even and finds its divisors.
  - It then checks if `n - x` is even and finds its divisors.
  - For each divisor, it checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` to ensure it forms a valid `k`.
  - The program correctly removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Correctness of Divisor Finding**:
  - The function `func_1(x)` correctly finds all divisors of `x`.

- **Correctness of Main Logic**:
  - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are correct for identifying potential `k` values.
  - The checks `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` are correct for ensuring the divisors form valid `k` values.

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct number of valid `k` values for each test case.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the case where `k = 1` is not valid.
  - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`, checks if they can form valid `k` values, and handles multiple test cases and edge cases correctly.

Final: **True**
