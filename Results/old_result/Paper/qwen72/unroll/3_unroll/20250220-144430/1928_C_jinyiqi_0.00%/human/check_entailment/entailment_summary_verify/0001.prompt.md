You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` and returns a list containing all divisors of `x`. The list is structured such that the first part contains divisors of `x` that are greater than the square root of `x`, followed by the divisors that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Vasya is in a line of students, and he remembers his position `n` and the number `x` he received during the settling.
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - The pattern is: the first `k` positions are numbered `1` to `k`, the next `k - 2` positions are numbered `k - 1` to `2`, and this repeats.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `x`.
   - The output is the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Constraints**:
   - `1 \leq t \leq 100`
   - `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`
   - `k > 1`

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given `n` and `x`, we need to find all `k` such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the pattern.

5. **Algorithm**:
   - The function `func_1(x)` is used to find all divisors of `x`.
   - The main logic checks two conditions:
     - `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n + x - 2` is even.
     - `(n - x) % 2 == 0`: This checks if `n - x` is even.
   - For each condition, it finds the divisors of the respective value and checks if they can form a valid `k` by ensuring `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.

6. **Function `func_1(x)`**:
   - This function finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a list.
   - It iterates from `1` to `sqrt(x)` to find divisors and appends both `i` and `x / i` to the output lists.
   - The lists are then combined and returned.

7. **Main Logic**:
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `output` to store valid `k` values.
   - It checks if `n + x - 2` is even and finds its divisors using `func_1`.
   - It checks if `n - x` is even and finds its divisors using `func_1`.
   - For each divisor, it checks if it can form a valid `k` and appends it to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `k = 1` is not valid.
   - It also correctly handles the constraints `1 \le x < n \le 10^9`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x` and checks if they can form valid `k` values.
- The logic for checking the divisors and ensuring they form valid `k` values is correct.
- The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the correct number of valid `k` values for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
