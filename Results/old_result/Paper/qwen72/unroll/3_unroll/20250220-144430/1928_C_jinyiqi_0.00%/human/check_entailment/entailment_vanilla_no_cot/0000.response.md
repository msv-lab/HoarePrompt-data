Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The program provided has several issues that need to be addressed to correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find all divisors of a given number `x`. However, it returns the divisors in a reversed order and appends them to `output2` and `output1`. This is unnecessary and can be simplified.
   - The function should return a list of divisors in a single list, not two separate lists.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic for determining the valid `k` values is flawed. The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` are not sufficient to ensure that the values of `k` are correct.
   - The conditions for appending `k` values to the `output` list are also incorrect. Specifically, the condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` is not necessary, and the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` is not sufficient to ensure that `k` is valid.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - For a given position `n` and number `x`, the valid `k` values should be determined based on the pattern of the settling.
   - The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the number `x` can appear in two possible positions within the cycle: `x` and `2k - 1 - x`.
   - We need to check if `n` can be expressed in the form `2k - 2 + x` or `2k - 2 + (2k - 1 - x)` for some integer `k`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_divisors(x):
    divisors = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != x // i:
                divisors.append(x // i)
    return divisors

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    valid_ks = set()
    
    # Check for the form 2k - 2 + x
    for d in find_divisors(n - x):
        k = (n - x) // d + 1
        if k > 1 and (n - x) % (2 * k - 2) == 0:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    # Check for the form 2k - 2 + (2k - 1 - x)
    for d in find_divisors(n + x - 1):
        k = (n + x - 1) // d + 1
        if k > 1 and (n + x - 1) % (2 * k - 2) == 0:
            valid_ks.add(k)
    
    print(len(valid_ks))
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Function `find_divisors`**:
   - This function returns all divisors of a given number `x` in a single list.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - We use two loops to check for valid `k` values:
     - The first loop checks if `n - x` can be expressed as `2k - 2 + x`.
     - The second loop checks if `n + x - 1` can be expressed as `2k - 2 + (2k - 1 - x)`.
   - For each divisor `d` of `n - x` and `n + x - 1`, we calculate `k` and check if it satisfies the conditions `k > 1` and the remainder condition.
   - We use a set `valid_ks` to store unique valid `k` values.

This corrected program should correctly determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
