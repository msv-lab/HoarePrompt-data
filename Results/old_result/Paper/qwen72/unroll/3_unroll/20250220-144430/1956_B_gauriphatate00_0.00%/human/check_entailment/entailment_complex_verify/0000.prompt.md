You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list a at most 2 times.
def func_1(n, a):
    counter = Counter(a)
    pairs = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count == 2)
    return min(pairs, n // 2)
    #The program returns the minimum value between the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly 2 times (`pairs`) and half of the total number of integers in `a` (`n // 2`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer in `a` is between 1 and `n` and appears at most 2 times. It returns the minimum value between the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly 2 times and half of the total number of integers in `a` (`n // 2`). The function does not modify the input list `a` or the integer `n`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to handle `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a)` and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes `t` being the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` being the last value of `n` processed, `a` being the last list of integers processed, `data` remaining the same list of strings as in the initial state, `idx` being the index after the last processed element in `data`, and `results` containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the maximum number of pairs you can form with the cards in your hand, but it does not consider the optimal play strategy of Nene, who always plays to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Here is a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

In this case, the program returns `2` because it counts the number of pairs you can form (1 pair of `1`s and 1 pair of `2`s), but it does not account for Nene's optimal play. According to the problem description, Nene will play optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours. The correct output should be `1` because Nene will play her `2` and `3` cards before you can play your second `1` card, ensuring that you only get 1 point.

The program needs to simulate the game more accurately to ensure that it considers the optimal play of both players.
