Functionality: ** The function reads input from `sys.stdin`, processes it to handle `t` test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, a)` and appends the result to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`. The function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes `t` being the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` being the last value of `n` processed, `a` being the last list of integers processed, `data` remaining the same list of strings as in the initial state, `idx` being the index after the last processed element in `data`, and `results` containing the results of `func_1(n, a)` for each test case. **
