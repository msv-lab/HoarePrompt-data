Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type should be seen consecutively for any permutation of scenarios. The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the '?' characters is flawed. Specifically, the program assigns 'F' or 'S' based on the current counts of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario, but it does not ensure that the overall sequence of transitions will meet the requirement for all permutations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
.?F??
?.???
F?.S?
??S.?
??.?.
```
The program might output:
```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```
However, if the player plays the scenarios in the order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the sequence of transition videos would be F, F, S, F, which has 3 consecutive 'F' videos. This violates the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3 \cdot 5}{4} \rceil = 4\) consecutive videos of the same type should be seen.

Thus, the program does not guarantee the correctness for all potential cases and is therefore incorrect.
