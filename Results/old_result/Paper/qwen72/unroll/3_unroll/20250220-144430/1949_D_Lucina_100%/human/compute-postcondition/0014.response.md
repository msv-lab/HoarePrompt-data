Output State: **The list `sa` now contains the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'F' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'S' characters is 0, as well as the indices of all rows (1 to n) where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The list `sb` remains unchanged. The list `xx`, and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The length of `sa` is now greater than or equal to its initial length, and `t` is still equal to the initial length of `sa`.**
