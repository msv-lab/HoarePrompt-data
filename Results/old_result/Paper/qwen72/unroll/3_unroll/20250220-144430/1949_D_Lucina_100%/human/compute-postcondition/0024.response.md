Postcondition: **The list `sa` contains the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'F' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'S' characters is 0. The list `sb` contains the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0. The lists `xx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the loop prints a string `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`. Each `nx` string is constructed by iterating through the characters of the corresponding row in `xx`. If a character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If a character is '?', and the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the list `sb` will also include the indices of all rows (1 to n) where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The loop prints a string `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`. Each `nx` string is constructed by iterating through the characters of the corresponding row in `xx`. If a character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If a character is '?', and the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.**
