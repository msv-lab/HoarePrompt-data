Postcondition: **The list `sa` contains the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'F' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'S' characters is 0. The list `sb` contains the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0. The list `xx`, and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`.**
