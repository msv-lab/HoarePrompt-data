You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. The input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j, and the character at the i-th row and i-th column is always '.'. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.

    n = int(input())

    #State: The list `xx` contains `n + 1` strings, where the first string is empty and the next `n` strings are the input strings. The lists `a` and `b` are of length `n + 1`, with `a[i]` and `b[i]` containing the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters, respectively, in the i-th row (and column) of the input matrix for all 1 <= i <= n. The elements at index 0 of `a` and `b` remain 0.

The length of `sa` is still greater than or equal to its initial length, and `t` is still equal to the initial length of `sa`. The loop prints a string `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`. Each `nx` string is constructed by iterating through the characters of the corresponding row in `xx`. If a character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If a character is '?', and the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`.

The list `sa` and the lists `xx`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged. The length of `sa` will still be less than the length of `sb`.

        #State: The list `sb` will contain the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0, as well as the indices of all rows (1 to n) where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The list `sa` and the lists `xx`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged. The length of `sa` will still be less than the length of `sb`. After the loop, the printed output will be a series of strings `nx` where each string `nx` is constructed by replacing '?' characters in `xx[i]` with 'S' if the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise.
    #State: The list `sa` contains the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'F' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'S' characters is 0. The list `sb` contains the indices of all rows (1 to n) where the count of 'S' characters is greater than 0 and the count of 'F' characters is 0. The lists `xx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the loop prints a string `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`. Each `nx` string is constructed by iterating through the characters of the corresponding row in `xx`. If a character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If a character is '?', and the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, 'F' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'S' is appended to `nx`. If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the list `sb` will also include the indices of all rows (1 to n) where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. The loop prints a string `nx` for each row `i` from 1 to `n`. Each `nx` string is constructed by iterating through the characters of the corresponding row in `xx`. If a character is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. If a character is '?', and the row index `i` or column index `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, 'S' is appended to `nx`. Otherwise, 'F' is appended to `nx`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes a symmetric matrix of size n x n, where n is an integer between 2 and 24, and each element is one of 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', with the diagonal elements always being '.'. It returns a string based on the processing of this matrix, considering that at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters are 'F' or 'S'.
