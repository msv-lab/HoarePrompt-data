Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of regular polygons with more than 3 sides. For example, consider the input where there are 6 sticks of length 3, which can form a square (4 sides) and a triangle (3 sides). The program will only count the number of triangles that can be formed, leading to an incorrect output of 2 instead of the expected output of 1 (since a square can be formed, and it uses more sticks than a triangle).

Input:
```
1
6
3 3 3 3 3 3
```

Expected Output:
```
1
```

Program Output:
```
2
