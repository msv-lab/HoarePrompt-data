Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `w` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the length of a list, followed by the list `palka` of integers. It then calculates the number of shapes that can be formed, where a shape is defined as a group of three identical integers in the list. The function prints the number of shapes for each test case. The initial values of `t`, `n`, and `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. The function does not return any value. **
