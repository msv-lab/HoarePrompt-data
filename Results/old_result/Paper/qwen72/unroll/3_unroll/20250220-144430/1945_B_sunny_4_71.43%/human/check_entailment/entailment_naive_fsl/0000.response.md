Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the two installations launch fireworks at the same time. According to the problem description, if both installations launch fireworks at the same time, they should be counted as a single firework in the sky for that minute. However, the current implementation simply adds the number of fireworks launched by each installation without considering the overlap.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1
```
The expected output is `4` because both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 2 minutes (from the launch time to the launch time + 1 minute). Therefore, at any given minute, there are 4 fireworks visible in the sky (2 from the first installation and 2 from the second installation, but the overlap is not considered correctly).

The program, however, outputs `6` because it calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation separately and adds them, without considering the overlap. This is incorrect.
