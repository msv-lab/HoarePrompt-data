Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period \(m\) and adds them together. However, this approach does not account for the overlap of visibility periods between the two installations, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider the following:

1. **Visibility Period Overlap**: We need to determine the maximum number of fireworks that can be visible at the same time, which means we need to find the time when the visibility periods of the fireworks from both installations overlap the most.

2. **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: The LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) is important because it determines the periodicity of the overlap of the two installations' firing times.

3. **Visibility Calculation**: For each installation, we need to calculate the number of fireworks that can be visible at any given time within the \(m + 1\) minute visibility period.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def max_fireworks(a, b, m):
    # Calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period
    A = (m + a) // a
    B = (m + b) // b
    
    # Calculate the number of overlapping periods within the visibility period
    lcm_ab = lcm(a, b)
    overlap = (m + lcm_ab) // lcm_ab
    
    # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the sum of the fireworks
    # from both installations, minus the number of overlapping periods
    max_visible = min(A, B) + 1 + max(0, min(A, B) - overlap)
    
    return max_visible

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(max_fireworks(a, b, m))
```

Explanation:
- **GCD and LCM**: We use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), which helps in determining the overlap of the firing times.
- **Visibility Calculation**: We calculate the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the \(m + 1\) minute visibility period.
- **Overlap Calculation**: We determine the number of overlapping periods within the visibility period.
- **Maximum Visible Fireworks**: The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is calculated by considering the overlap and the individual launches.

This corrected program should produce the correct output for the given problem.
