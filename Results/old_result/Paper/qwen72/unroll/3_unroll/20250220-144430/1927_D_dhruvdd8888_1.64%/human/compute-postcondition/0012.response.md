To determine what will be printed when the `print(nums)` statement executes, let's analyze the initial state step by step:

1. **`arr`**: This is a list of tuples where each tuple represents a range in the `nums` list and the value that was repeated in that range. However, the exact content of `arr` is not provided, so we cannot determine the specific ranges or values.

2. **`s`**: This is the index of the last element in the `nums` list. The exact value of `s` is not provided, but it is known to be the index of the last element in `nums`.

3. **`e`**: This is set to 0. The exact value of `e` is 0.

4. **`num`**: This is the last element in the `nums` list, and it is given that `num` is `-1`. Therefore, the last element of `nums` is `-1`.

5. **`LA`**: This is the length of `arr` minus 1. The exact value of `LA` is not provided, but it is known to be the index of the last element in `arr`.

6. **`ppp`**: This is set to 23. The exact value of `ppp` is 23.

Given the information, the `print(nums)` statement will print the entire `nums` list. The only explicit information we have about `nums` is that its last element is `-1`. The rest of the list is not specified, so we can only describe the known part.

Output: **[nums list with the last element being -1 (the exact content of the list is not provided, but the last element is -1)]**
