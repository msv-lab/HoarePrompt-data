Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers where all elements from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` (inclusive) are set to `i`, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - `i`, `res` is a list that includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)`, `is_already_stairs` is False, and `i` is greater than 0.**
