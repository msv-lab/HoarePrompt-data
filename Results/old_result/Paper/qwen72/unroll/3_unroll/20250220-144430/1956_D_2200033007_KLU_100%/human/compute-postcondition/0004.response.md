Output State: **The program returns without any value.**

The code snippet provided is a simple return statement without any value. Since there is no value specified to be returned, the program will return `None` by default. However, the task format specifies that the return should be described in natural language, so the output state is that the program returns without any value. The initial state variables `i`, `arr`, `start_index`, `res`, and `is_already_stairs` are not modified by the code snippet, and their values remain as described in the initial state.
