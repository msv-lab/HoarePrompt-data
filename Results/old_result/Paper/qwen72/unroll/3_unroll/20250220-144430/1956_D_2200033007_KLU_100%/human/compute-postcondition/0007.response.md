Output State: **`i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `start_index` is an integer such that 0 <= `start_index` <= len(`arr`) - 1, `res` is a list that contains the tuple `(start_index, start_index)`, `is_already_stairs` is False.**

The tuple `(start_index, start_index)` has been appended to the list `res`. All other variables remain unchanged.
