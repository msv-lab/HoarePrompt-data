Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `start_index` and `end_index`, and operates on a list of integers `arr`. It returns the maximum score that can be achieved by partitioning the subarray `arr[start_index:end_index+1]` according to a specific scoring rule. The scoring rule is as follows: if `start_index` equals `end_index`, the score is the maximum of 1 and the integer at `start_index` in `arr`. Otherwise, the score is the maximum of the square of the subarray length and the scores obtained by recursively partitioning the subarray and adding the value at the partition index. The function uses a dictionary `res_dict` to memoize results for subarrays to avoid redundant calculations. After the function concludes, `res_dict` contains the computed scores for the subarrays defined by the tuples (`start_index`, `end_index`).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `start_index` and `end_index`, which are integers such that 0 <= `start_index` <= `end_index` < len(arr), where `arr` is an array of integers. The function returns a list of tuples, each representing a segment of the array. The specific output depends on the following conditions:

- If the length of the segment (end_index - start_index + 1) is 1 and the element at `start_index` is greater than 0, the function returns an empty list.
- If the length of the segment is 1 and the element at `start_index` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns a list containing a single tuple (start_index, start_index).
- If the maximum value of a certain calculation (determined by `func_1`) over the segment is equal to the square of the segment's length, the function returns a list containing the tuple (start_index, end_index).
- If the function finds a position `i` within the segment such that the sum of the element at `i` and the results of `func_1` on the segments before and after `i` equals the maximum value, the function returns the concatenation of the results of `func_2` on the segments before and after `i`.
- If the sum of the element at `start_index` and the result of `func_1` on the segment starting from `start_index + 1` equals the maximum value, the function returns the result of `func_2` on the segment starting from `start_index + 1`.
- If the sum of the element at `end_index` and the result of `func_1` on the segment ending at `end_index - 1` equals the maximum value, the function returns the result of `func_2` on the segment ending at `end_index - 1`.

In all cases, the function modifies the segment of the array between `start_index` and `end_index` to identify and return the appropriate list of tuples.

If `arr[start_index + i] == i`, then `is_already_stairs` is False because at least one element in the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i]` does not match its index from 0 to `i-1`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0. If `arr[start_index + i] != i`, then `i` is now `i - 1`, all elements from index `start_index` to `start_index + i - 1` (inclusive) are set to `i - 1`, `res` includes the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i - 1)`, and `is_already_stairs` is False, with `i` being greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies a list `res` to store operations as tuples `(l, r)`. It checks if the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` is already in a "staircase" form (where each element matches its index from 0 to `i`). If the subarray is already in this form, the function returns without performing any operations. If not, the function recursively modifies the subarray to ensure it matches the staircase form, appending the necessary operations to `res`. After the function concludes, `arr` will have the subarray `arr[start_index:start_index + i + 1]` set to the staircase form, and `res` will contain the operations used to achieve this. The function does not return any value.
