Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Logic**:
   - The program initializes a variable `possible` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - For each position `i`:
     - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, the program checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. If so, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
     - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`, the program checks if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`. If so, it continues to the next position. If not, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, the program prints "YES" if `possible` is `True`, indicating that a valid template exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

This logic correctly handles all the conditions described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
