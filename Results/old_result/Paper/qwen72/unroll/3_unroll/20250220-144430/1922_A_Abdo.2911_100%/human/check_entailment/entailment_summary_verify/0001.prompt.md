You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        possible = False
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. It then checks if it is possible to transform string `a` into string `b` by changing any character in `a` to the corresponding character in `c`. If such a transformation is possible for any test case, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` are no longer in scope.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - It then reads the strings `a`, `b`, and `c` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.

2. **Template Matching Logic:**
   - The function initializes a boolean variable `possible` to `False`. This variable will be used to determine if a valid template exists.
   - It iterates through each character position `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
     - **Case 1:** If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`:
       - This means both `a` and `b` must match the same character at position `i` in the template.
       - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (and thus `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template at this position, and we can set `possible` to `True` and break out of the loop.
     - **Case 2:** If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`:
       - This means `a` and `b` must match different characters at position `i` in the template.
       - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template at this position, and we continue to the next position.
       - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template at this position, and we can set `possible` to `True` and break out of the loop.

3. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `possible` is `True`, it prints "YES" because a valid template exists.
   - If `possible` is `False`, it prints "NO" because no valid template exists.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the conditions for a valid template:
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `c[i]` must be different.
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, `c[i]` must be different from both.
- The function breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a valid position, which is efficient.
- The function correctly prints "YES" or "NO" based on the value of `possible`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
