### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in a permutation \( p \) of integers from 0 to \( n-1 \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can make at most \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of elements in the permutation.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) which represents the length of the permutation.

3. **Finding the First Maximum:**
   - The variable `mak` is initialized to 0.
   - The function iterates through the indices from 1 to \( n-1 \) and makes a query to compare \( (p[mak] \mid p[mak]) \) with \( (p[i] \mid p[i]) \).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to \( i \). This step ensures that `mak` is the index of the element with the highest value in the permutation.

4. **Finding the Second Maximum:**
   - The variable `mak2` is initialized to `mak`.
   - The function iterates through all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) and makes a query to compare \( (p[mak] \mid p[mak2]) \) with \( (p[i] \mid p[mak2]) \).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `mak` to \( i \) and resets `pans` to contain only \( i \).
   - If the result is `=`, it appends \( i \) to `pans`. This step ensures that `pans` contains all indices \( i \) such that \( p[i] \) is equal to \( p[mak] \).

5. **Finding the Maximum XOR:**
   - The variable `mak` is reset to 0.
   - The function iterates through the indices in `pans` and makes a query to compare \( (p[pans[mak]] \mid p[pans[mak]]) \) with \( (p[pans[i]] \mid p[pans[i]]) \).
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `mak` to \( i \). This step ensures that `mak` is the index of the element in `pans` with the highest value.

6. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The function outputs the indices `mak2` and `mak` such that \( p[mak2] \oplus p[mak] \) is maximized.
   - It flushes the output after each query and the final answer.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation and then finds another index that maximizes the XOR with the maximum value.
- The number of queries made is \( 2n + (n - 1) \) which is \( 3n - 1 \), well within the limit of \( 3n \) queries.
- The logic for finding the maximum XOR is sound, as it ensures that the maximum value is compared with all other values to find the pair with the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and follows the problem constraints and requirements.
