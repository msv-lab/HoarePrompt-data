The function `func` operates in an interactive environment and does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, it works with a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function's goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the bitwise XOR of `p[i]` and `p[j]` is maximized. The function can make at most 3n queries to achieve this. The total sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.

Functionality: **The function operates in an interactive environment to find two indices `i` and `j` from a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^4. The function returns the indices `i` and `j` such that the bitwise XOR of `p[i]` and `p[j]` is maximized, using at most 3n queries.**
