Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `s`. It then constructs a string `r` by mapping each integer in `s` to a character in the alphabet string `a` (where `a` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'). Each character in `r` is determined by the index of the corresponding integer in `s` within the list `b`, which is initialized to `[0] * 26`. The character is incremented by 1 each time it is used. The function prints the constructed string `r` for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
