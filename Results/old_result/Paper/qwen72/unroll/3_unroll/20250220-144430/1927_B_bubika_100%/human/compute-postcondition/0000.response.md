Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, `a` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each trace a, there exists a suitable string s.**

Explanation:
- The variable `a` is reassigned to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
- The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.
- The precondition about the sum of `n` over all test cases and the existence of a suitable string `s` for each trace `a` still holds.
