You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def func_1(t, n, q, c, queries):` where `t` is the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n` and `q` are the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), `c` is a list of positive integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and `queries` is a list of q pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) representing the borders of the subarray (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: The list `b` will contain cumulative sums of 1s and 2s based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. Specifically, for each index `i` from 1 to `n`, if `a[i]` is greater than 1, `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 1`; otherwise, `b[i]` will be `b[i-1] + 2`. The other variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` will remain unchanged.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: 1 3 6 10 15 (where the values are the cumulative sums of the original list `a`)
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the loop executes all iterations. The variables `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries` also remain unchanged. The loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each query based on the conditions `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `q`, `c`, and `queries`. `t` represents the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). `n` and `q` represent the length of the array `c` and the number of queries (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 · 10^5), respectively. `c` is a list of positive integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9). `queries` is a list of `q` pairs of integers (l_i, r_i) representing the borders of the subarray (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The function returns the results of the queries based on the subarrays defined by `l_i` and `r_i` for each test case. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
