Output State: **`k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= min(n, b), `a` and `b` are positive integers, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, `ans` is `k * b + (n - k) * a`.**

The value of `ans` is updated to be the sum of `k * b` and `(n - k) * a`. The other variables `k`, `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged.
