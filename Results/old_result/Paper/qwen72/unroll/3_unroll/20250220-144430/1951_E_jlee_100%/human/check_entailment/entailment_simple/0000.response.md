### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, the function correctly prints "NO" because a single character string is always a palindrome.
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different, the function correctly prints "YES" and the entire string as a single part, which is non-palindromic.

3. **Uniform Character Check**:
   - If all characters in the string are the same, the function correctly prints "NO" because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.
   - If all characters except one are the same, the function checks if the middle character (for odd-length strings) is different. If it is, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the entire string as a single part.

4. **General Case**:
   - The function iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`x`).
   - It then looks for a second different character to split the string into two parts.
   - If it finds such a split, it prints "YES" and the two parts.
   - If it does not find a valid split, it prints "NO".

5. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic correctly handles all edge cases and general cases as described in the problem statement.
   - The function ensures that if a valid partition is found, it is printed, and if no valid partition is found, "NO" is printed.
