The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `t`, `cows_info`, and `ratings`.

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- `cows_info` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k`. `n` represents the number of cows, and `k` represents your cow's index, with 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `ratings` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, with 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all `a_i`'s being pairwise different. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

The function returns the current value of `wins`, which is greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, a list of tuples `cows_info` where each tuple contains the number of cows `n` and your cow's index `k`, and a list of lists `ratings` where each sublist contains the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. It returns the current value of `wins`, which is greater than or equal to `k`.**
