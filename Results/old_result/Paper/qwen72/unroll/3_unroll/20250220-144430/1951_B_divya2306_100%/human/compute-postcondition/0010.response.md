To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `win_with_swap`, and `k`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `wins` is the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k-1]` up to the point where an element greater than `a[k-1]` is encountered, or `n` if no such element is found.
- `wins` is less than `k`.
- `win_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 1`.
- The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.

The loop statement is:
```
for i in range(win_with_swap, k - 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute:
- The range `range(win_with_swap, k - 1)` must have at least one element.
- This means `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.

Let's break it down:
1. `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`.
2. `wins` is less than `k`.
3. Therefore, `win_with_swap` (which is `wins + 1`) must be less than `k - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute:
- `win_with_swap` must be less than `k - 1`.
- This implies `wins + 1 < k - 1`.
- Simplifying, `wins < k - 2`.

Since `wins` is less than `k`, the condition `wins < k - 2` is a stricter requirement that must be met for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `win_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`, and `i` starts from `win_with_swap`.

State: **`wins` is less than `k - 2`, `win_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, `i` is `win_with_swap`, `k` is greater than `win_with_swap + 1`**
