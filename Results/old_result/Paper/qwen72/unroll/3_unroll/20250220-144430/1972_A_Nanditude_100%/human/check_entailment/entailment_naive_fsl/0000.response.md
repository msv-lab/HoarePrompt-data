Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the difficulties in array `a` are greater than the corresponding difficulties in array `b` in a way that ensures the minimum number of new problems are proposed.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

The program incorrectly counts the number of new problems needed. It increments the count `cnt` every time an element in `b` is less than the current element in `a`, but it does not correctly handle the insertion and sorting of new problems as described in the problem statement.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Counting the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the corresponding elements in `b`.
2. Inserting new problems with appropriate difficulties to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.
3. Sorting the array `a` after each insertion and removing the last element.

The provided program does not perform these steps correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
