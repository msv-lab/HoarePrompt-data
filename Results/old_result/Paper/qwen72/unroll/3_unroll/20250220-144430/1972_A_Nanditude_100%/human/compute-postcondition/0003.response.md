The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `b` is a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` and `n` are positive integers between 1 and 100, and `a` and `b` are lists of `n` integers each, sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
