The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute based on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer. The state of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` must be a positive integer, `_` is 0**
