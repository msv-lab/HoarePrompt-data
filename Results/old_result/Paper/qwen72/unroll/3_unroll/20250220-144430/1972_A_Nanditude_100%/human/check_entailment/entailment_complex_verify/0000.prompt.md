You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

    1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700

    6
    
    4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6

Output

    3
    
Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), a is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_n ≤ 10^9), and b is a list of n integers sorted in non-decreasing order (1 ≤ b_1 ≤ b_2 ≤ ... ≤ b_n ≤ 10^9).

    #State: The variable `t` is decremented by the number of iterations that have been executed. The variable `n` is the last input integer value read for the number of elements in the lists. The lists `a` and `b` are the last input lists of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable `cnt` is the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` for the last iteration. The variable `i` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the first element in `b` for the last iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads a series of inputs from the user. It first reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` and two lists `a` and `b` of `n` integers each, where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function then counts the number of elements in `b` that are less than the corresponding elements in `a` and prints this count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the final state is that `t` has been decremented to 0, `n` holds the last input integer value for the number of elements in the lists, and `a` and `b` hold the last input lists of `n` integers. The variable `cnt` holds the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a` for the last iteration, and `i` holds the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than or equal to the first element in `b` for the last iteration.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, it does not handle the case where the difficulties in array `a` are greater than the corresponding difficulties in array `b` in a way that ensures the minimum number of new problems are proposed.

Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
6
1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Actual Output:**
```
4
```

The program incorrectly counts the number of new problems needed. It increments the count `cnt` every time an element in `b` is less than the current element in `a`, but it does not correctly handle the insertion and sorting of new problems as described in the problem statement.

The correct approach should involve:
1. Counting the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the corresponding elements in `b`.
2. Inserting new problems with appropriate difficulties to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`.
3. Sorting the array `a` after each insertion and removing the last element.

The provided program does not perform these steps correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
