Correctness: **False**

Explanation:

The logic in the program is flawed, particularly in the else block. The goal is to maximize profit by choosing the optimal \( k \) for the promotion. Let's break down the correct approach and identify the issues in the given program:

1. **Case 1: \( b \le a \)**
   - If the modified price \( b \) is less than or equal to the usual price \( a \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price \( a \). The profit is \( n \times a \).
   - The program correctly handles this case.

2. **Case 2: \( b - a \ge n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is greater than or equal to \( n \), it is optimal to sell all buns at the modified price. The profit is the sum of the first \( n \) integers starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 each time, which is \( \frac{(2b - n + 1) \times n}{2} \).
   - The program correctly handles this case.

3. **Case 3: \( b - a < n \)**
   - If the difference between the modified price \( b \) and the usual price \( a \) is less than \( n \), it is optimal to sell the first \( k = b - a \) buns at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).
   - The profit from the first \( k \) buns is the sum of the first \( k \) integers starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1 each time, which is \( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2} \).
   - The profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns is \( (n - k) \times a \).
   - The total profit is \( \frac{(b + (b - k + 1)) \times k}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

The given program incorrectly calculates the profit in the else block. Specifically, it uses the formula \( (b - a) \times (b - a + 1) // 2 + a \times n \), which does not correctly account for the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            k = b - a
            modified_profit = (b + (b - k + 1)) * k // 2
            usual_profit = (n - k) * a
            print(modified_profit + usual_profit)
```

This corrected version correctly calculates the profit for the third case by summing the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns and adding the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.
