The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on `n_cases`. If `n_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the function `func` is intended to solve a problem involving an array `a` where `a_i = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`, and the operation `swap(k)` is performed for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. However, these details do not affect the loop head directly. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be greater than 0 and `i` should be 0.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
