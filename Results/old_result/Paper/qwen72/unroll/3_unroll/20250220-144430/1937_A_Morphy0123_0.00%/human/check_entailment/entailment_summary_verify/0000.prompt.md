You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            while power < log2(n):
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the position of the element 1 in an array after performing swap operations for each `2 ≤ k ≤ n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. For other values of `n`, it prints the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. After processing all test cases, the function has no return value, and the variable `n_cases` remains unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for finding the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the swap operations. Specifically, the logic for determining the largest divisor and performing the swap is missing. The program incorrectly assumes that the position of 1 can be determined by some power of 2, which is not always the case.

For example, consider the input `n = 6`:
- Initially, the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(2)`, the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After performing `swap(3)`, the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (no change since 3 has no divisors other than 1 and 3).
- After performing `swap(4)`, the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (no change since 4 is already in the correct position).
- After performing `swap(5)`, the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (no change since 5 has no divisors other than 1 and 5).
- After performing `swap(6)`, the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5]` (swapping `a_3` and `a_6`).

The final array is `[2, 1, 3, 4, 6, 5]`, and the position of 1 is 2. However, the program will incorrectly output a different value based on its flawed logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
