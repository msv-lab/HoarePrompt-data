Functionality: ** The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters and does not return any specific value. It reads an integer from the user input, and for each value in the range of this integer, it calls the function `func_1`. The function itself does not modify any variables or state within `func_2`. The final state of the program after `func_2` concludes is unchanged except for any side effects that `func_1` may have. **
