### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of houses `n` and the preferences string `a` from the user.
   - **Prefix Sum Array Construction**: It constructs a prefix sum array `S` where `S[i][0]` is the cumulative count of residents who prefer the left side (0) up to the i-th house, and `S[i][1]` is the cumulative count of residents who prefer the right side (1) up to the i-th house.
   - **Condition Checking**: It iterates through all possible positions to place the road (from 0 to n). For each position `i`, it calculates:
     - `left`: the number of residents on the left side of the road.
     - `lsum`: the total number of residents on the left side.
     - `right`: the number of residents on the right side of the road.
     - `rsum`: the total number of residents on the right side.
   - **Satisfaction Condition**: It checks if the number of satisfied residents on each side meets the condition (at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied). If the condition is met, it updates the answer to the position `i` if it is closer to the middle of the village than the current answer.
   - **Output**: The function prints the position of the road that satisfies the condition and is closest to the middle of the village.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the user.
   - **Test Case Loop**: It iterates through each test case and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **No Return Value**: The function does not return any value but relies on the side effects of `func_1` to print the results for each test case.

### Validation of Original Assessment:

- **Prefix Sum Array**: The prefix sum array `S` is correctly constructed to keep track of the cumulative counts of residents who prefer the left and right sides.
- **Condition Checking**: The condition checking logic is correct. It ensures that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
- **Optimal Position**: The program correctly updates the answer to the position that is closest to the middle of the village and satisfies the condition.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the road is placed before the first house or after the last house. For example, if the road is placed before the first house, `i = 0`, and if it is placed after the last house, `i = n`.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `n = 3`, `a = "101"`
