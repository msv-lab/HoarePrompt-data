### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and for each test case, it reads \( x \) and computes \( y \) as \( x // 2 \).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then computes \( y \) as \( x // 2 \) and prints \( y \).

3. **Correctness of \( y = x // 2 \)**:
   - The key to solving the problem is to maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - \( y = x // 2 \) is a reasonable choice because:
     - If \( x \) is even, \( y = x // 2 \) is exactly half of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = y \).
     - If \( x \) is odd, \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is close to half of \( x \). In this case, \( \gcd(x, y) \) is likely to be 1, but \( y \) itself is large, contributing significantly to \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Verification**:
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest possible \( y \) that is a divisor of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = y \). Thus, \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 2y \), which is maximized.
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is not a divisor of \( x \), but it is still a large value. The \( \gcd(x, y) \) is usually 1, so \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + y \), which is also maximized for the given \( y \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case \( x = 2 \) correctly, as \( y = 1 \) and \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \), which is the maximum possible value for \( x = 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly computes and prints a value of \( y \) that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
