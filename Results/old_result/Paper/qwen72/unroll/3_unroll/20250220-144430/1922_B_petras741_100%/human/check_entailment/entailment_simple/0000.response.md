### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `w`.

2. **Frequency Count:**
   - The program initializes a list `q` of size `n + 1` to count the frequency of each exponent in `w`.
   - It then iterates through the list `w` and increments the corresponding index in `q`.

3. **Non-degenerate Triangle Condition:**
   - A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
   - For sticks with lengths \(2^{a_i}\), \(2^{a_j}\), and \(2^{a_k}\), the triangle inequality can be simplified to checking if the exponents are the same or form a non-decreasing sequence (i.e., \(a_i \leq a_j \leq a_k\)).

4. **Counting Valid Triangles:**
   - The program identifies the unique exponents in `eta` and their frequencies.
   - If there is only one unique exponent, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same exponent using the combination formula \( \binom{q[eta[0]]}{3} \).
   - For multiple unique exponents, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same exponent for each unique exponent using the combination formula \( \binom{q[eta[j]]}{3} \).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from one exponent and 1 stick from another exponent using the formula \( \binom{q[eta[j]]}{2} \times q[eta[0]] \).

5. **Output:**
   - The result for each test case is printed, and the program handles all test cases as specified.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Single Exponent Case:**
  - If all exponents are the same, any three sticks can form a triangle. The program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from `n` sticks using the combination formula \( \binom{n}{3} \).

- **Multiple Exponents Case:**
  - The program correctly identifies unique exponents and their frequencies.
  - It correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from the same exponent.
  - It also correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from one exponent and 1 stick from another exponent, ensuring that the triangle inequality is satisfied.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `n < 3` by printing `0`, which is correct since a triangle cannot be formed with fewer than 3 sticks.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle based on the given problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
