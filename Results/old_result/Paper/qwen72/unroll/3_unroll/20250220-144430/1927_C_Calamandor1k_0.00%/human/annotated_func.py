#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and b is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` will have their values as provided in the input for the last iteration. The variables `len_a`, `len_b`, `count_a`, and `count_b` will be updated based on the last iteration's input, and the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration depending on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are both greater than or equal to `k // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases to process. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. The function then checks if at least `k // 2` elements in both `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k`. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. The final state of the program includes the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` from the last test case, and the variables `len_a`, `len_b`, `count_a`, and `count_b` are updated based on the last test case.
