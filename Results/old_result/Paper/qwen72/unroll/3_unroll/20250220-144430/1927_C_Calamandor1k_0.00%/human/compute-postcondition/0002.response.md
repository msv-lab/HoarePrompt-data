Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` will have their values as provided in the input for the last iteration. The variables `len_a`, `len_b`, `count_a`, and `count_b` will be updated based on the last iteration's input, and the loop will have printed 'YES' or 'NO' for each iteration depending on whether `count_a` and `count_b` are both greater than or equal to `k // 2`.**
