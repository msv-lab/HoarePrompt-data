Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Use of `Decimal` for Infinity**: The program uses `Decimal('Infinity')` to represent infinity. This is not necessary and can be replaced with `float('inf')` or simply a very large integer, as the problem does not involve any decimal arithmetic.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Removals**: The logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program only checks the count of consecutive elements equal to the first element before a different element is encountered. This does not account for all possible scenarios where the array can become non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Handling of Beautiful Arrays**: The program correctly identifies when all elements in the array are the same and prints `-1` in such cases. However, it does not correctly handle other cases where the array is beautiful but not all elements are the same.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases well, such as arrays with only two elements or arrays where the first and last elements are different but the middle elements are the same.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Identify if the array is already non-beautiful.
- If the array is beautiful, find the minimum number of elements to remove to make it non-beautiful by checking all possible subarrays and their properties.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
