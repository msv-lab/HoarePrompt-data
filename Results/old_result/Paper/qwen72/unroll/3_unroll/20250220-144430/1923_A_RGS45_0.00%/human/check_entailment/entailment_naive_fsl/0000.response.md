Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are multiple chips and the closest free cell to the left is not the first free cell. For example, consider the input:

```
1
8
1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0
```

The correct output should be 2, as you can move the chip from the 6th cell to the 5th cell, and then move the chip from the 5th cell to the 4th cell. However, the program will output 1, which is incorrect. The program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last chip, but it does not account for the minimum number of moves required to form a single block of chips.
