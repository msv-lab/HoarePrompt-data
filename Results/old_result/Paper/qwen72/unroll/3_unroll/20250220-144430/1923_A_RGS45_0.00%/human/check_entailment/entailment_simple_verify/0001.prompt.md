You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = str(input(''))
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of t elements, where each element is a tuple (n, a) consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the cells of the ribbon, with a_i = 0 indicating a free cell and a_i = 1 indicating a cell with a chip. Additionally, each test case must have at least one cell containing a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = str(input(''))
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and a string `arr` representing the cells of the ribbon. It will then find the first and last positions of the chip (1) in the ribbon, extract the substring between these positions, and print the number of free cells (0) in this substring. After all iterations, the initial variables `t` and the list of tuples will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip:**
   - The program uses `arr.find('1')` to find the index of the first chip (1) in the array.
   - It uses `arr[::-1].find('1')` to find the index of the last chip (1) in the array when reversed. This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the end of the array.

3. **Extracting the Subarray:**
   - The program then extracts the subarray `z` from the first chip to the last chip using `arr[x:n - y]`.
   - This subarray `z` contains all the chips and any free cells between them.

4. **Counting Free Cells:**
   - Finally, the program prints the number of free cells (0) in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')`.

### Analysis:
- The program aims to count the number of free cells between the first and last chip, which is indeed the minimum number of operations needed to move all chips into a single block.
- The logic is sound because moving chips to form a single block without any free cells between them can be achieved by moving each chip to the closest free cell to the left until all chips are contiguous.
- The subarray `z` correctly captures the segment of the ribbon that contains all the chips and any free cells between them.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Chip:** If there is only one chip, the subarray `z` will contain only that chip, and the count of free cells will be 0, which is correct.
- **Chips Already in a Block:** If all chips are already in a single block, the subarray `z` will contain no free cells, and the count of free cells will be 0, which is correct.
- **Multiple Free Cells Between Chips:** The program correctly counts the free cells between the first and last chip, which is the minimum number of moves required.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given examples.

### Correctness:
**True**
