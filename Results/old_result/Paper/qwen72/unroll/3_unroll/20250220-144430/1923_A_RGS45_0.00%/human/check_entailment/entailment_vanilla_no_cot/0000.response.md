Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array `arr` representing the ribbon.

2. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - `x = arr.find('1')` finds the index of the first chip (1) in the array.
   - `y = arr[::-1].find('1')` finds the index of the last chip (1) in the array by reversing the array and finding the first chip from the reversed array. The index `y` is then adjusted to account for the reversal.

3. **Extracting the Subarray**:
   - `z = arr[x:n - y]` extracts the subarray that contains all the chips and no free cells outside this block.

4. **Counting the Free Cells**:
   - `print(z.count('0'))` counts the number of free cells (0) within this subarray, which represents the minimum number of operations needed to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles the problem constraints and edge cases, ensuring that the minimum number of operations is calculated correctly for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
