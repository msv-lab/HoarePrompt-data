Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and a string `arr` representing the cells of the ribbon. It will then find the first and last positions of the chip (1) in the ribbon, extract the substring between these positions, and print the number of free cells (0) in this substring. After all iterations, the initial variables `t` and the list of tuples will remain unchanged.**
