Precondition: **The function should take an integer t and a list of integers n, where 1 <= t <= 50 and for each n in the list, 1 <= n <= 50.** 

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should accept the number of test cases and a list of integers as inputs. A more appropriate function definition would be:

```python
def func(t, n_list):
```

With the precondition:

**t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 50, and n_list is a list of t integers where each integer n satisfies 1 <= n <= 50.**
