The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It interacts with the user to clear the console screen, then prompts the user to input an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50). For each of the `t` iterations, it prompts the user to input another integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed such that if `n` is even, each character from 'A' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in the uppercase English alphabet is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then each character from 'B' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in the uppercase English alphabet is repeated twice. The function does not modify any external state or variables.
