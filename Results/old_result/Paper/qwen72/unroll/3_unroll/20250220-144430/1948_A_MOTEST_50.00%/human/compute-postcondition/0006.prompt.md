You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take an integer t and a list of integers n, where 1 <= t <= 50 and for each n in the list, 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                ans, x = 'AAA', 1
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The variable `t` is unchanged. The variable `s` remains 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. For each iteration of the loop, if the input `n` is 1, 'NO' is printed. For all other values of `n`, 'YES' is printed followed by a string `ans` that is constructed as follows: if `n` is even, `ans` is a string where each character from 'A' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in `s` is repeated twice. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' and then each character from 'B' to the character corresponding to the index `n // 2 - 1` in `s` is repeated twice.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `n`, where 1 <= t <= 50 and 1 <= n[i] <= 50 for each element in the list. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the exact return value is not specified.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
