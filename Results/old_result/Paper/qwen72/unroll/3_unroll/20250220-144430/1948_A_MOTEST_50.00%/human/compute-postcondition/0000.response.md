The code snippet `os.system('cls')` is used to clear the console screen in a Windows environment. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `t` and `n` or any other variables in the initial state. The function's parameters and their constraints remain unchanged.

Output State: **The function should take an integer `t` and a list of integers `n`, where 1 <= `t` <= 50 and for each `n` in the list, 1 <= `n` <= 50. The console screen has been cleared.**
