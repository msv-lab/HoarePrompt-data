### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, parsing the number of elements `n`, the integers `x` and `y`, and the array `arr` for each test case.
   - The parsed data is stored in a list of tuples `test_cases`, where each tuple contains `(n, x, y, arr)`.

2. **Beautiful Pairs Calculation (func_1):**
   - For each test case, the function `func_1` initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This is the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This is the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary `freq`. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the `count` because it means there are elements in the array that, when paired with the current element `a`, form a beautiful pair.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all test cases, `func_1` returns a list of results, which is then printed by `func_2`.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The logic for calculating `rx` and `ry` is correct. `rx` ensures that the sum of the pair is divisible by `x`, and `ry` ensures that the difference of the pair is divisible by `y`.
  - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used correctly to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.
  - The counter `count` is updated correctly for each element in the array.

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The input parsing is correct. It reads the entire input, splits it into lines, and processes each test case as described.
  - The test cases are correctly appended to the `test_cases` list.
  - The results from `func_1` are printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input parsing and the calculation of beautiful pairs are both correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
