The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. It also accepts a parameter `cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in your hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list at most 2 times. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the 0-th card to the n-1-th card, given that the card with value 1 can be used up to its count in the `cards` list.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a list of tuples `cases`. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the cards. It returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the cards, considering that the card with value 1 can be used up to its count in the list.**
