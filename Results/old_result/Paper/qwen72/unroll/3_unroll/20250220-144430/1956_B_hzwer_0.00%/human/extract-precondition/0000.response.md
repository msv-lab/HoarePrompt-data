It seems there is a mismatch between the provided function definition and the problem description. The function definition should include parameters that represent the input described in the problem. Based on the problem description, the function should take the number of test cases, the number of cards each player receives, and the list of integers on the cards in your hand as inputs. Here is the corrected function definition and the precondition:

Function definition:
```python
def max_points(t, cases):
```

Precondition: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in your hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
