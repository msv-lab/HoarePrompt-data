Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n), representing the number of cards each player receives and the integers on the cards in your hand, respectively. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_n at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. n is an input integer.**
