Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `cards` from the input. It then computes and returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the cards, considering the constraints that each integer from 1 to `n` appears in the list at most twice. The function does not modify the values of `t`, `cases`, `n`, or `cards`. **
