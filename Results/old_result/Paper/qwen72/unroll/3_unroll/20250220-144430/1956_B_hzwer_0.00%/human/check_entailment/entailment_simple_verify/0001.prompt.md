You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a card game where two players, you and Nene, take turns placing cards on a table.
   - Each player starts with `n` cards, and the deck contains `2n` cards with integers from 1 to `n`, each appearing exactly twice.
   - You score a point if you place a card that matches a card already on the table.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem.
   - The DP table `dp` is defined such that `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points you can score starting from the `i`-th turn with `j` cards already on the table that you can match.

3. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes the DP table with dimensions `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.
   - The values `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` are set to 0, which seems to be a base case initialization, but it is not clear why these specific values are chosen.

4. **DP Table Filling**:
   - The program iterates over the DP table in reverse order, starting from `i = n - 3` down to `0`.
   - For each `i` and `j`, it checks the count of the card `j + 1` in your hand:
     - If the card `j + 1` is not in your hand (`count == 0`), then `dp[i][j]` is the same as `dp[i + 1][j]` (no points can be scored with this card).
     - If the card `j + 1` appears once in your hand (`count == 1`), then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of:
       - `dp[i + 1][j]` (skip this card).
       - `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` (place this card and score a point).
     - If the card `j + 1` appears twice in your hand (`count == 2`), then `dp[i][j]` is the maximum of:
       - `dp[i + 1][j]` (skip this card).
       - `dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1` (place one card and score a point).
       - `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` (place both cards, but this seems incorrect because it implies you can place both cards in one turn, which is not allowed).

5. **Issues**:
   - The initialization of `dp[n - 1][0]` and `dp[n - 2][0]` to 0 is not clearly justified and might be unnecessary.
   - The condition `dp[i + 1][j + 1]` in the case where the card appears twice in your hand is incorrect. You cannot place both cards in one turn.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach should consider the optimal strategy for both players.
   - You should place a card that maximizes your score while minimizing Nene's score.
   - Nene will always place a card that maximizes her score, so you need to account for her optimal moves.

7. **Simplified Solution**:
   - A simpler approach is to count the number of unique cards in your hand and the number of cards that appear twice.
   - You can score a point for each card that appears twice in your hand, and you can score a point for each unique card that Nene does not have a matching card for.

Given the issues identified in the DP approach, the program is incorrect.
