Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct based on the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.

2. **Counting Elements**: It uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The program then iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to determine the MEX of the array `c` that Alice and Bob will form. The logic is as follows:
   - If an integer `i` appears exactly once in the array `a`, Alice will pick it to maximize the score.
   - If an integer `i` appears zero times in the array `a`, it is the smallest integer that does not appear in `a`, and thus it is the MEX.
   - If two or more integers that appear exactly once are found, the game will end with the next integer that does not appear in `a` being the MEX.

4. **Return Value**: The program returns the smallest integer `i` that either does not appear in `a` or appears exactly once and has been picked by Alice, ensuring that the MEX is correctly determined.

This approach ensures that both players play optimally:
- Alice will always pick the smallest integer that appears exactly once to maximize the score.
- Bob will pick any integer that appears more than once or the smallest integer that appears exactly once if Alice has already picked one.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, making it a valid solution for the problem.
