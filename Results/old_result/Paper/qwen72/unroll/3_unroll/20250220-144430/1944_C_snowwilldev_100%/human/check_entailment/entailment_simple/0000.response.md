### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `N` and the list `a` of `N` integers.
   - It initializes a `defaultdict` named `cnt` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.

2. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - The program iterates over the list `a` and updates the count of each integer in the `cnt` dictionary.

3. **Finding the MEX:**
   - The program initializes a variable `t` to 0.
   - It then iterates over the range from 0 to `N` (inclusive).
   - For each integer `i` in this range, it checks if `cnt[i]` is 1. If so, it increments `t` by 1.
   - The loop returns the integer `i` if either `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0.

4. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice wants to maximize the score (MEX of `c`), and Bob wants to minimize it.
   - The program's logic is based on the idea that Alice and Bob will play optimally. Alice will try to include as many unique elements as possible in `c`, and Bob will try to prevent Alice from doing so.
   - The program correctly identifies the first integer `i` that either appears only once or does not appear at all in `a`. This is because:
     - If `cnt[i]` is 0, it means `i` is the smallest non-negative integer not in `a`, which is the MEX.
     - If `cnt[i]` is 1 and `t` reaches 2, it means that Alice and Bob have already included two different elements in `c`, and the next smallest integer `i` that appears only once will be the MEX.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `a` contains only one unique element correctly. For example, if `a = [1, 1]`, the MEX will be 0, which is the correct output.
   - The program also handles the case where `a` contains all integers from 0 to `N-1` exactly once. In such a case, the MEX will be `N`, which is the correct output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` after Alice and Bob play optimally. The reasoning and the logic are sound, and the program should produce the correct output for the given problem description and constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**
