You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob play yet another game on an array a of size n . Alice starts
with an empty array c . Both players take turns playing, with Alice starting
first.

On Alice's turn, she picks one element from a , appends that element to c ,
and then deletes it from a .

On Bob's turn, he picks one element from a , and then deletes it from a .

The game ends when the array a is empty. Game's score is defined to be the
MEX^\dagger of c . Alice wants to maximize the score while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find game's final score if both players play optimally.

^\dagger The \operatorname{MEX} (minimum excludant) of an array of integers is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in the
array. For example:

  * The MEX of [2,2,1] is 0 , because 0 does not belong to the array. 
  * The MEX of [3,1,0,1] is 2 , because 0 and 1 belong to the array, but 2 does not. 
  * The MEX of [0,3,1,2] is 4 , because 0 , 1 , 2 and 3 belong to the array, but 4 does not. 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, find game's score if both players play optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    0 0 1 1
    
    4
    
    0 1 2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1

Output

    2
    1
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, a possible game with a score of 2 is as follows:

  1. Alice chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[0,0,1] and c=[1] . 
  2. Bob chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[0,1] and c=[1] . 
  3. Alice chooses the element 0 . After this move, a=[1] and c=[1,0] . 
  4. Bob chooses the element 1 . After this move, a=[\,] and c=[1,0] . 

At the end, c=[1,0] , which has a MEX of 2 . Note that this is an example game
and does not necessarily represent the optimal strategy for both players.

- Annotated Code:

    print(func_1())

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input through a method not defined in the function signature, such as reading from standard input or another source. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the list `a` contains `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    N = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt = defaultdict(int)
    for i in range(N):
        cnt[a[i]] += 1
        
    #State: The `cnt` dictionary will contain the count of each integer in the list `a`. The keys in `cnt` will be the unique integers from `a`, and the values will be the number of times each integer appears in `a`. The variables `N` and `a` will remain unchanged.
    t = 0
    for i in range(N + 1):
        if cnt[i] == 1:
            t += 1
        
        if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0:
            return i
        
    #State: The loop will return the first integer `i` where either `t` reaches 2 or `cnt[i]` is 0. The variables `N` and `a` will remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice and Bob are playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice appends elements to an array `c` and Bob deletes elements from `a`.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after the game ends, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing integer by deleting it if possible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to determine the MEX of `c`.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of times an integer appears exactly once in `a`.

4. **Key Logic:**
   - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it means the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`. Alice can include this integer in `c`, and Bob can delete it, so `t` is incremented.
   - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, it means either:
     - There are two or more integers that appear exactly once, which means Alice can include one and Bob can delete the other, and the MEX will be `i`.
     - The integer `i` does not appear in `a` at all, so the MEX will be `i`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all elements are the same or where the elements are in a specific order.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program correctly returns the MEX of `c` for each test case.
   - The provided example test cases are handled correctly by the program.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
