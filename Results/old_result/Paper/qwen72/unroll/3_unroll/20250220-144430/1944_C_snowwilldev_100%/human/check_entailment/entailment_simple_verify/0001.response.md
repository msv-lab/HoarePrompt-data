### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves Alice and Bob playing a game with an array `a` of size `n`. Alice appends elements to an array `c` and Bob deletes elements from `a`.
   - The goal is to find the MEX of `c` after the game ends, with Alice trying to maximize the MEX and Bob trying to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice will always try to include the smallest missing integer in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will try to prevent Alice from including the smallest missing integer by deleting it if possible.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in the array `a`.
   - It then iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to determine the MEX of `c`.
   - The variable `t` is used to count the number of times an integer appears exactly once in `a`.

4. **Key Logic:**
   - If `cnt[i] == 1`, it means the integer `i` appears exactly once in `a`. Alice can include this integer in `c`, and Bob can delete it, so `t` is incremented.
   - If `t >= 2` or `cnt[i] == 0`, it means either:
     - There are two or more integers that appear exactly once, which means Alice can include one and Bob can delete the other, and the MEX will be `i`.
     - The integer `i` does not appear in `a` at all, so the MEX will be `i`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `a` is empty or contains only one element correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where all elements are the same or where the elements are in a specific order.

6. **Output Verification:**
   - The program correctly returns the MEX of `c` for each test case.
   - The provided example test cases are handled correctly by the program.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `N` and the array `a`.

- **Counting Occurrences:**
  - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each element in `a`. This is a correct approach to keep track of how many times each integer appears in the array.

- **Finding the MEX:**
  - The program iterates through the integers from 0 to `N` (inclusive) to find the MEX.
  - It uses the variable `t` to count the number of integers that appear exactly once in `a`.
  - The condition `if t >= 2 or cnt[i] == 0` is used to determine the MEX:
    - If `t >= 2`, it means there are at least two integers that appear exactly once, and Alice can include one of them in `c` while Bob can delete the other. This ensures that the MEX will be `i`.
    - If `cnt[i] == 0`, it means the integer `i` does not appear in `a` at all, so the MEX will be `i`.

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The logic correctly identifies the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in `c` after both players have played optimally.
  - The program ensures that Alice and Bob's actions are taken into account by counting the occurrences of each integer and using the `t` variable to track the number of unique elements.

- **Example Test Cases:**
  - For the input `4 0 0 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `2` because the smallest missing integer in `c` after the game is 2.
  - For the input `4 0 1 2 3`, the program correctly outputs `1` because the smallest missing integer in `c` after the game is 1.
  - For the input `2 1 1`, the program correctly outputs `0` because the smallest missing integer in `c` after the game is 0.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of `c` based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob. It handles all edge cases and provides the correct output for the given problem description.

### Final:
**True**
