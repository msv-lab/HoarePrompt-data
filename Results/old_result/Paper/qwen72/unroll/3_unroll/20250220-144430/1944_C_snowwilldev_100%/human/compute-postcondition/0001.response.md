The code snippet reads a line of input, splits it into multiple strings based on spaces, and then converts each string into an integer, storing the result in the list `a`.

Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input through a method not defined in the function signature. For each test case, `n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and the list `a` contains `n` integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The number of test cases `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `N` is an integer input by the user. `a` is a list of integers read from the input.**
