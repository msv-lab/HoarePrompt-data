Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `N` and a list `a` of `N` integers from standard input. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `a` using a dictionary `cnt`. The function returns the first integer `i` (starting from 0) where either the count of `i` in `a` is 0, or there are at least two unique integers in `a` that have a count of 1. The variables `N` and `a` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution. **
