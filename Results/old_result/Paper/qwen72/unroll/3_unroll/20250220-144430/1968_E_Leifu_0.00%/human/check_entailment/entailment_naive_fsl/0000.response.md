Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. Specifically, the program does not generate the required number of points for \(n > 3\). For example, when \(n = 4\), the program only outputs 3 points instead of 4, and when \(n = 5\), it outputs 4 points instead of 5. This means the program does not meet the requirement of outputting \(n\) points for each test case. Additionally, the points generated do not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
