Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to the given integer `lex`. However, the logic used to determine the letters is flawed. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the distribution of the remaining sum (`lex`) among the three letters, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Here are the issues:
1. The loop `for j in range(2)` always appends 26 to the array if `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, which is not always the correct approach. For example, if `lex` is 55, the correct letters should be "czz" (3 + 26 + 26), but the program might output "azz" (1 + 26 + 28) which is incorrect.
2. The program does not correctly handle the case where `lex` is exactly 26. It should append 26 to the array and set `lex` to 0, but it appends 1 and sets `lex` to 25.
3. The program sorts the array `arr` before printing, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect lexicographical order. For example, for `lex` = 48, the correct output should be "auz" (1 + 21 + 26), but sorting the array might output "uaz" (21 + 1 + 26).

To fix these issues, the program should:
1. Distribute the remaining sum more carefully to ensure the lexicographically smallest word.
2. Avoid sorting the array to maintain the correct order of letters.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        
        # Initialize the array to store the positions of the three letters
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        
        # Distribute the sum to the three letters
        for j in range(3):
            if lex > 26:
                arr[j] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[j] = lex
                lex = 0
        
        # Convert positions to letters and print
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()  # Move to the next line for the next test case
```

Given the issues in the original program, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
