### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part of the original assessment is accurate.

2. **Initialization**: For each test case, an empty list `arr` is initialized to store the positions of the letters in the word. This part is also accurate.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The original program's logic for decoding the word is indeed flawed. The program should aim to use the smallest possible values for the first two positions to maximize the remaining value for the third position, ensuring the lexicographically smallest word.
   - The original logic:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the smallest possible value that fits within the remaining `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it should append the largest possible value that fits within the remaining `lex`.
     - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is incorrect for the same reason as the previous point.
   - The corrected logic:
     - For the first two positions, if `lex` is greater than 26, assign 26 to the current position and subtract 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is 26 or less, assign `lex - 1` to the current position and set `lex` to 1. This ensures that the smallest possible values are used for the first two positions.
     - This logic is more aligned with the requirement to find the lexicographically smallest word.

4. **Final Position**: The program appends the remaining `lex` value to `arr` after the loop. This part is correct in both the original and corrected programs.

5. **Sorting and Output**: The program sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order and prints the corresponding characters. This part is correct in both the original and corrected programs.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        for j in range(2):
            if lex > 26:
                arr[j] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[j] = lex - 1
                lex = 1
        arr[2] = lex
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `arr` with three zeros.
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - For the first two positions, if `lex` is greater than 26, assign 26 to the current position and subtract 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is 26 or less, assign `lex - 1` to the current position and set `lex` to 1. This ensures that the smallest possible values are used for the first two positions.
3. **Final Position**: Assign the remaining `lex` value to the third position.
4. **Sorting and Output**: Sort `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order and print the corresponding characters.

### Correctness:
The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the decoding process. The corrected program should be used instead.

Final: **False**
