### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `cases` and processes each test case individually by reading the encoded sum `lex` for each case.

2. **Initialization**:
   - For each test case, an empty list `arr` is initialized to store the positions of the letters in the word.

3. **Decoding Logic**:
   - The program iterates over the first two positions of the word (since the word is 3 letters long).
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`. This is incorrect because it should append the smallest possible value that fits within the remaining `lex` and not always 1.
   - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is also incorrect because it should append the largest possible value that fits within the remaining `lex` and not always 26.
   - If `lex` is greater than or equal to 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`. This is incorrect for the same reason as the previous point.

4. **Final Position**:
   - The program appends the remaining `lex` value to `arr` after the loop.

5. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The program sorts `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order and prints the corresponding characters.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- **State of the program right before the function call**: The function should take an integer `n` as input where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
- **Overall this is what the function does**:
  - The function reads an integer `cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) from the input, which represents the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.
  - The function then calculates and prints three lowercase Latin letters whose positions sum up to `lex`. The letters are sorted in ascending order before printing.
  - The function does not return any value.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        arr = [0, 0, 0]
        for j in range(2):
            if lex > 26:
                arr[j] = 26
                lex -= 26
            else:
                arr[j] = lex - 1
                lex = 1
        arr[2] = lex
        arr.sort()
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        print()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `arr` with three zeros.
2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - For the first two positions, if `lex` is greater than 26, assign 26 to the current position and subtract 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is 26 or less, assign `lex - 1` to the current position and set `lex` to 1. This ensures that the smallest possible values are used for the first two positions.
3. **Final Position**: Assign the remaining `lex` value to the third position.
4. **Sorting and Output**: Sort `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order and print the corresponding characters.

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the decoding process. The corrected program should be used instead.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
