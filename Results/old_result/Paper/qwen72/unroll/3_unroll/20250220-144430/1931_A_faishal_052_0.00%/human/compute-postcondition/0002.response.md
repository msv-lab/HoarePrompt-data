To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's break down the code and understand its behavior:

1. **Loop Structure**: The outer loop runs `cases` times. Each iteration of the outer loop processes a new `lex` value.
2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop runs twice and processes the `lex` value to create an array `arr` of three elements.
3. **Array Construction**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 1.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
   - If `lex` is 52 or greater, it appends 26 to `arr` and decreases `lex` by 26.
4. **Final Element**: After the inner loop, it appends the remaining `lex` value to `arr`.
5. **Sorting and Printing**: The array `arr` is sorted, and each element is converted to a character using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` and printed without a newline.

Given the initial state and the code, the output state will be the characters printed for each `lex` value over `cases` iterations.

### Example Calculation

Let's assume `cases = 2` and the input values for `lex` are 53 and 78.

#### First Iteration (lex = 53)
1. `arr = []`
2. First inner loop iteration:
   - `lex = 53` (greater than 52)
   - `arr.append(26)` -> `arr = [26]`
   - `lex = 53 - 26 = 27`
3. Second inner loop iteration:
   - `lex = 27` (greater than 26)
   - `arr.append(26)` -> `arr = [26, 26]`
   - `lex = 27 - 26 = 1`
4. Append remaining `lex`:
   - `arr.append(1)` -> `arr = [26, 26, 1]`
5. Sort `arr`:
   - `arr.sort()` -> `arr = [1, 26, 26]`
6. Print characters:
   - `chr(1 + 96) = 'a'`
   - `chr(26 + 96) = 'z'`
   - `chr(26 + 96) = 'z'`
   - Output: `azz`

#### Second Iteration (lex = 78)
1. `arr = []`
2. First inner loop iteration:
   - `lex = 78` (greater than 52)
   - `arr.append(26)` -> `arr = [26]`
   - `lex = 78 - 26 = 52`
3. Second inner loop iteration:
   - `lex = 52` (greater than 52)
   - `arr.append(26)` -> `arr = [26, 26]`
   - `lex = 52 - 26 = 26`
4. Append remaining `lex`:
   - `arr.append(26)` -> `arr = [26, 26, 26]`
5. Sort `arr`:
   - `arr.sort()` -> `arr = [26, 26, 26]`
6. Print characters:
   - `chr(26 + 96) = 'z'`
   - `chr(26 + 96) = 'z'`
   - `chr(26 + 96) = 'z'`
   - Output: `zzz`

### Final Output State
After all iterations, the output state will be the concatenated characters printed for each `lex` value.

Output State: **azzzzz**.
