Output State: **t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of integers where each integer x in test_cases satisfies 2 <= x <= 1000, results is a list of integers where each integer is the largest y (1 <= y < x) such that gcd(x, y) + y is maximized for each x in test_cases.**
