You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each trace a, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        l = int(input())
        
        s = [(0) for i in range(l)]
        
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        ans = ''
        
        for j in array:
            ans += chr(s[j] + 97)
            s[j] += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 0 <= a_i < n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5, and for each trace a, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z. The loop has processed t test cases, and for each test case, it has printed a string ans constructed from the array of integers. The variable s for each test case is a list of l integers, where each integer has been incremented by the number of times the corresponding index was accessed in the array.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers representing indices. It returns a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters that is consistent with the indices provided in `a` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
