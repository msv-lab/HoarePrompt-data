The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases. `n` is an integer where 1 <= n <= 2 \cdot 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= a_i < n, representing the indices of a suitable string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5. The function returns a string `s` that is consistent with the indices provided in `a` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, and `a` is a list of integers representing indices. It returns a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters that is consistent with the indices provided in `a` for each test case.**
