Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element at index `i` with its adjacent element if the elements at `i-1` and `i+1` are the same.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Check for All Elements Being the Same:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the array `a` are the same by converting the array to a set `aa` and checking if the length of the set is 1.
   - If all elements are the same, it prints `-1` because it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Finding the Minimum Number of Elements to Remove:**
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - It then iterates through the array, counting the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp` (`cnt`).
   - When it encounters an element that is not equal to `tmp`, it updates `ans` with the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the minimum of `ans` and `cnt` to account for the last segment of consecutive elements.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints `ans`, which is the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues in the Program:

- **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Elements to Remove:**
  - The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only counts consecutive segments of the same element and does not consider the broader context of the array.
  - For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will count the segments `[1, 1, 1]` and `[2, 2]` and incorrectly determine that removing 1 element (from the segment `[2, 2]`) will make the array non-beautiful. However, removing any single element from this array will still leave it beautiful.

- **Handling of Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where all elements are the same and prints `-1`.
  - However, it does not correctly handle cases where the array is already non-beautiful or can be made non-beautiful by removing a different number of elements.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
- If all elements are the same, the array is always beautiful, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements.
- If the array is not all the same, we need to find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no segment of the array can be made beautiful by the given operation.

A correct approach would involve:
- Checking if all elements are the same.
- If not, finding the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern of beauty. This can be done by identifying the longest segments of consecutive elements and ensuring that removing the minimum number of elements breaks these segments.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the flawed logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
