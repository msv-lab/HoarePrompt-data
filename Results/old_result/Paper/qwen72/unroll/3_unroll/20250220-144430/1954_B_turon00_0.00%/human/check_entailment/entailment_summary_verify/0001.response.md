Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Identifying a Beautiful Array**: The problem states that the given array is already beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array where all elements are the same by repeatedly applying the operation. The program correctly identifies if the array has only one unique element using the set `aa`. If all elements are the same, it prints `-1`, which is correct.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**: The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It does this by:
   - Initializing `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - Using a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`.
   - Iterating through the array and counting consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.
   - If a different element is found, it updates the minimum number of elements to remove (`ans`) with the current count of consecutive `tmp` elements.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final count of consecutive `tmp` elements.

The original assessment correctly points out that the program only checks the consecutive occurrences of the first element (`tmp`). This is indeed a logical flaw because it does not consider all unique elements in the array. To make the array non-beautiful, we need to ensure that no sequence of operations can transform the array into one where all elements are the same. This requires checking the maximum consecutive occurrences of any unique element in the array, not just the first one.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum number of elements to remove for each test case, but due to the logical flaw, it may not always produce the correct result.

To fix this, the program should:
- Iterate through all unique elements in the array.
- For each unique element, count the maximum number of consecutive occurrences.
- The minimum number of elements to remove would be the maximum of these counts.

Given this, the current program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the general case of finding the minimum removals for all unique elements in the array.

Final: **False**
