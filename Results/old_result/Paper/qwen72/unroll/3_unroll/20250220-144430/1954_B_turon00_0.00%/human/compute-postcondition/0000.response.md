Output State: **The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) is a positive integer. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, meaning it is possible to make all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function should return the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible. `t` is the number of test cases, which is an input integer.**
