Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Identifying a Beautiful Array**: The problem states that the given array is already beautiful. A beautiful array can be transformed into an array where all elements are the same by repeatedly applying the operation. The key insight is that if the array has only one unique element, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements, and the program correctly outputs `-1` in such cases.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**: The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It does this by:
   - Initializing `tmp` with the first element of the array.
   - Using a set `aa` to check if all elements are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`.
   - Iterating through the array and counting consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.
   - If a different element is found, it updates the minimum number of elements to remove (`ans`) with the current count of consecutive `tmp` elements.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final count of consecutive `tmp` elements.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum number of elements to remove for each test case.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:
- The program only checks the consecutive occurrences of the first element (`tmp`). This is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. It should consider all unique elements in the array, not just the first one.

To fix this, the program should:
- Iterate through all unique elements in the array.
- For each unique element, count the maximum number of consecutive occurrences.
- The minimum number of elements to remove would be the maximum of these counts.

Given this, the current program is incorrect because it does not handle the general case of finding the minimum removals for all unique elements in the array.

Correctness: **False**
