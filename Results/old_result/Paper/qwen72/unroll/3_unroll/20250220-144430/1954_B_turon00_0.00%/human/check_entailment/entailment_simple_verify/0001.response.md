Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself. This part is accurate.

2. **Identifying a Beautiful Array**: The program correctly identifies if the array has only one unique element using the set `aa`. If the set contains only one element, it prints `-1`, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Finding Minimum Removals**: The program aims to find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. However, the logic used to determine this is flawed:
   - The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and counts consecutive occurrences of `tmp`.
   - It updates the minimum number of elements to remove (`ans`) with the current count of consecutive `tmp` elements whenever a different element is found.
   - After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final count of consecutive `tmp` elements.

   This approach is incorrect because it only considers the consecutive occurrences of the first element. A beautiful array can have multiple unique elements, and the minimum number of elements to remove should be determined by considering the maximum consecutive occurrences of any unique element in the array, not just the first one.

4. **Output**: The program prints the minimum number of elements to remove for each test case. However, due to the logical flaw mentioned above, the output is not correct for all cases.

To correct this, the program should:
- Iterate through all unique elements in the array.
- For each unique element, count the maximum number of consecutive occurrences.
- The minimum number of elements to remove would be the maximum of these counts.

Given this, the current program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the general case of finding the minimum removals for all unique elements in the array.

Final: **False**
