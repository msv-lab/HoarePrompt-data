Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying the Minimum Removals**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of elements to remove by counting consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`a[0]`). However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the requirement that the array must stop being beautiful, which means it should no longer be possible to make all elements the same using the allowed operations.
   - The program only checks the count of consecutive elements equal to `a[0]`, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements.

2. **Handling of Single-Element Arrays**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where the array has only one unique element by printing `-1`. This is correct because a single-element array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **General Case Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the general case where the array has more than one unique element. It should consider the structure of the array and the positions where elements can be removed to prevent the array from being beautiful.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Identify if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing the fewest elements.
2. Check if there is a way to remove elements such that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements
        min_removals = float('inf')
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
                # Try removing a[i] and see if the resulting array is non-beautiful
                new_a = a[:i] + a[i+1:]
                if not is_beautiful(new_a):
                    min_removals = min(min_removals, 1)
        
        if min_removals == float('inf'):
            # If no single removal can make the array non-beautiful, try removing more elements
            for i in range(1, n - 1):
                for j in range(i + 1, n):
                    if a[i-1] == a[j+1]:
                        new_a = a[:i] + a[i+1:j] + a[j+1:]
                        if not is_beautiful(new_a):
                            min_removals = min(min_removals, j - i + 1)
        
        if min_removals == float('inf'):
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(min_removals)

def is_beautiful(a):
    n = len(a)
    if n < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
            return True
    return False

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Check for Single-Element Arrays**:
   - If the array has only one unique element, print `-1`.

2. **Check for Minimum Removals**:
   - Iterate through the array and try removing each element at index `i` where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]`. Check if the resulting array is non-beautiful.
   - If no single removal can make the array non-beautiful, try removing multiple elements in a similar manner.
   - If no valid removals are found, print `-1`.

3. **Helper Function `is_beautiful`**:
   - This function checks if the array is beautiful by verifying if any element at index `i` can be replaced with `a[i-1]` or `a[i+1]` to make all elements the same.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
