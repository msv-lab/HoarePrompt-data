You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) is a positive integer. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, meaning it is possible to make all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function should return the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        aa = set(a)
        
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop iterates `t` times), and the variables `n` and `a` will hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `tmp` will hold the first element of the last test case's array `a`. The variable `aa` will be a set containing the unique elements of the last test case's array `a`. The variable `cnt` will be 0, and the variable `ans` will hold the minimum number of elements to remove to make the last test case's array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each with an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. It returns the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
