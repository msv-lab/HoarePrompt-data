Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

# Annotated Program:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5) representing the length of the array, and an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) is a positive integer. The array `a` is guaranteed to be beautiful, meaning it is possible to make all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. The function should return the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        tmp = a[0]
        
        aa = set(a)
        
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        
        cnt = 0
        
        ans = n
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: After all iterations of the loop, the variable `t` will be 0 (since the loop iterates `t` times), and the variables `n` and `a` will hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `tmp` will hold the first element of the last test case's array `a`. The variable `aa` will be a set containing the unique elements of the last test case's array `a`. The variable `cnt` will be 0, and the variable `ans` will hold the minimum number of elements to remove to make the last test case's array non-beautiful, or -1 if it is impossible.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. The function prints the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from the array to make it non-beautiful, where a beautiful array is one where all elements can be made the same by performing a specified operation. If it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful, the function prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `tmp`, `aa`, `cnt`, and `ans` will hold the state of the last test case processed.
