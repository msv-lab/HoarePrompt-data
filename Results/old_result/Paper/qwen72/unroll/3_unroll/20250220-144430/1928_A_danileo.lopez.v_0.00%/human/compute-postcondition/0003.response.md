The function `func` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle, with the constraint that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The function returns the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as the product of `a` and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle, and returns the area of the rectangle.**
