The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be initialized to a specific value before the loop starts, but `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
