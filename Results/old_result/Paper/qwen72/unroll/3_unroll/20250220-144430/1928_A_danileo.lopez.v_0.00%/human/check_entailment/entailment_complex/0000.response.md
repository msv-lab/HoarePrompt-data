Reasoning:  
The logic of the program is based on the condition that if either dimension \(a\) or \(b\) of the rectangle is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions. This is because an even dimension allows for a cut that results in two equal parts, which can then be rearranged to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, no such cut can be made to form a new rectangle with different dimensions, as cutting an odd dimension will always result in two rectangles that cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Let's analyze the program step by step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then iterates \(t\) times, reading two integers \(a\) and \(b\) for each test case. This is correct as per the problem description.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:`. This is the correct condition to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. If either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle and rearrange the pieces to form a new rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, no such rearrangement is possible.

3. **Output**: The program prints "Yes" if the condition is met and "No" otherwise. This is also correct as per the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the edge cases where both dimensions are 1 (which is an odd number), and it will print "No" as expected.

Given the problem description and the logic implemented in the program, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
