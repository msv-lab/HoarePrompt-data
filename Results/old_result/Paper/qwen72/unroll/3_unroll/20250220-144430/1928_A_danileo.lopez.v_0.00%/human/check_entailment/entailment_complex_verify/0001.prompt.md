You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two integers a and b as input where 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, representing the dimensions of the rectangle. The function will be called multiple times, each time with a different set of dimensions, as part of a series of test cases.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read two integers `a` and `b` from the input. If either `a` or `b` is even, it will print 'Yes'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it will print 'No'. The values of `a` and `b` will be updated with each iteration, but the value of `t` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads two integers `a` and `b` from the input, representing the dimensions of a rectangle. If either `a` or `b` is even, it prints 'Yes'. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the input values `a` and `b` will have been processed `t` times, and the corresponding 'Yes' or 'No' results will have been printed for each test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob starts with a rectangle of size \(a \times b\).
   - He cuts the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles such that the new rectangle formed is different from the original.
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle that is different from the original.

3. **Explanation of the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) of the rectangle.
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "Yes" because Bob can form a new rectangle.
   - If the condition is false, it prints "No" because Bob cannot form a new rectangle.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For \(1 \times 1\): Both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, so the output is "No".
   - For \(2 \times 1\): \(a\) is even, so the output is "No" (but this is incorrect based on the problem statement, it should be "No" because the only possible cut results in two \(1 \times 1\) rectangles).
   - For \(2 \times 6\): \(a\) is even, so the output is "Yes" (correct because it can be cut into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle).
   - For \(3 \times 2\): \(b\) is even, so the output is "Yes" (correct because it can be cut into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles and form a \(1 \times 6\) rectangle).
   - For \(2 \times 2\): Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even, so the output is "Yes" (correct because it can be cut into two \(1 \times 2\) rectangles and form a \(1 \times 4\) rectangle).
   - For \(2 \times 4\): \(a\) is even, so the output is "Yes" (correct because it can be cut into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and form a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle).
   - For \(6 \times 3\): \(a\) is even, so the output is "No" (but this is incorrect based on the problem statement, it should be "Yes" because it can be cut into two \(3 \times 3\) rectangles and form a \(3 \times 6\) rectangle).

5. **Identifying the Issue:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. It should always print "Yes" in such cases because Bob can always form a new rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

### Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case where both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. It should always print "Yes" in such cases, but it prints "No" for some of these cases, as seen in the example \(6 \times 3\).
