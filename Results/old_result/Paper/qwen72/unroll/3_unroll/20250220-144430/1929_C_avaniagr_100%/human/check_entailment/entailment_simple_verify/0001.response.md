### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Sasha can place a bet of `y` coins and, if he wins, his coins increase by `y * (k - 1)`.
   - If he loses, he loses `y` coins.
   - Sasha cannot lose more than `x` times in a row.
   - Initially, Sasha has `a` coins.
   - We need to determine if Sasha can guarantee that he will have at least `n` coins for any integer `n`.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `x < k - 1`, Sasha can always recover from any sequence of losses because he can place a bet that will ensure he wins back more than he lost.
   - If `x == k - 1`, Sasha can still recover from a sequence of losses, but he needs at least `x + 2` coins to ensure he can place the necessary bets to recover.
   - If `x > k - 1`, the problem becomes more complex. Sasha needs to ensure he has enough coins to cover the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and still be able to place bets to recover.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It splits the input line into `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - It then checks the conditions:
     - If `x < k - 1`, it prints "YES" if `a >= x + 1` and "NO" otherwise.
     - If `x == k - 1`, it prints "YES" if `a >= x + 2` and "NO" otherwise.
     - If `x > k - 1`, it calculates a value `z` which is the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses. It then prints "YES" if `a >= z` and "NO" otherwise.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**
     - Sasha can always recover from any sequence of losses because he can place a bet that will ensure he wins back more than he lost.
     - The condition `a >= x + 1` is correct because Sasha needs at least `x + 1` coins to ensure he can place the necessary bets to recover from `x` consecutive losses.
   - **Case 2: `x == k - 1`**
     - Sasha can still recover from a sequence of losses, but he needs at least `x + 2` coins to ensure he can place the necessary bets to recover.
     - The condition `a >= x + 2` is correct.
   - **Case 3: `x > k - 1`**
     - The program calculates `z` which is the minimum number of coins needed to ensure recovery from `x` consecutive losses.
     - The calculation `z = k - 2` and the loop `for i in range(x - k + 3): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is intended to simulate the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses and the subsequent bets needed to recover.
     - The loop logic is designed to increment `z` in a way that simulates the recovery process. However, the logic is not straightforward and may be difficult to understand. Let's break it down:
       - `z = k - 2` initializes `z` to a value that represents the initial number of coins needed to start the recovery process.
       - The loop `for i in range(x - k + 3)` runs `x - k + 3` times, which is the number of additional bets needed to recover after `x` consecutive losses.
       - Inside the loop, `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is intended to simulate the recovery process by adding the minimum number of coins needed to ensure a win after a series of losses.
       - This logic is based on the idea that after `x` consecutive losses, Sasha needs to place a bet that will cover the losses and ensure a win, which is a valid approach.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program correctly handles the cases where `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`.
   - For the case where `x > k - 1`, the loop logic is more complex but appears to be designed to ensure that Sasha can recover from the worst-case scenario of `x` consecutive losses. The logic is based on the geometric progression of losses and wins, which is a valid approach.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct for the cases where `x < k - 1` and `x == k - 1`. For the case where `x > k - 1`, the loop logic is complex but appears to be designed to correctly simulate the worst-case scenario. Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the program should be able to determine the correct answer for all test cases.

Final: **True**
