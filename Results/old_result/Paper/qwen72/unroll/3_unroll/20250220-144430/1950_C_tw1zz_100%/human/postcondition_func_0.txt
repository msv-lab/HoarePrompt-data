The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm" (24-hour format). It converts each time string to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and prints the converted time. The function does not return any value, and the variables `t` and `s` remain unchanged after the function execution.
