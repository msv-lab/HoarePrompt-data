### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`) using the `split(':')` method.

2. **Time Conversion:**
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hour (`h`) to the 12-hour format hour (`h1`) and determine whether it is `AM` or `PM`.
   - The conversion logic is correct for all hours from `00` to `23`:
     - Hours from `01` to `11` are directly mapped to the same hour in 12-hour format with `AM`.
     - Hour `12` is mapped to `12` with `PM`.
     - Hours from `13` to `23` are mapped to the corresponding hour in 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and using `PM`.
     - Hour `00` is mapped to `12` with `AM`.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program correctly prints the 12-hour format time followed by `AM` or `PM` with the required format: `hh:mm AM` or `hh:mm PM`.
   - The `sep=''` parameter in the `print` function ensures that there are no extra spaces between the components of the time string.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all valid inputs and produces the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
