Output State: **The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) where each integer represents the number of rounds played in each test case, and a list of tuples where each tuple contains a trump suit (one of "CDHS") and a list of 2n cards (each card is a two-character string, with the first character being one of "23456789" and the second character being one of "CDHS", and all cards are different). The `input()` function call waits for user input, but no variables are affected by this code snippet.**

In natural language: The initial state remains unchanged. The function still expects the same parameters, and no variables have been modified by the `input()` function call. The program is simply paused, waiting for user input.
