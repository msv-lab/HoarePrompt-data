### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and needs to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and buying as many jewels as possible at each stall before moving to the next.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` to count the number of stalls set up, `number` to store the price per jewel, and `tab` to store the prices of the stalls.
   - The program enters a loop where it tries to set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends `number` to `tab`, subtracts `Min * Max` from `n`, and increments `rep`.
   - The loop continues until `n` is zero, `k` is zero, `rep` reaches 60, or `n` is less than `k`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The loop ensures that `k` is reduced by the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall.
   - The condition `n * Min <= k` is used to ensure that Alice can buy the required number of jewels without exceeding the number of coins.
   - The loop also ensures that `rep` does not exceed 60, which is the maximum number of stalls Bob can set up.

4. **Output:**
   - If `k` is zero after the loop, it means Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices.
   - If `k` is not zero, it means it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by breaking out of the loop and printing "NO".
   - It also handles the case where `k` is zero by printing "YES" and the stall prices.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The loop runs at most 60 times, which is within the constraints.
   - The operations inside the loop are simple arithmetic and list operations, which are efficient.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial Setup:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.
  - It initializes `rep`, `number`, and `tab` appropriately for each test case.

- **Loop Logic:**
  - The loop condition `while n != 0 and k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k` ensures that the loop runs as long as there are coins left, jewels to be bought, the number of stalls is less than 60, and the number of coins is sufficient to buy at least one jewel.
  - The calculation of `Min` and `Max` as `min(n // k, k)` and `max(int(n / k), k)` is correct. However, using `int(n / k)` is redundant since `n // k` already performs integer division.
  - The conditional logic inside the loop is intended to handle different scenarios:
    - If `Max == k` and `n * Min <= k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
    - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.
  - The program appends `number` to `tab` and subtracts `Min * Max` from `n`, which correctly updates the state of the program.

- **Output Logic:**
  - After the loop, if `k` is zero, the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices.
  - If `k` is not zero, the program prints "NO".

### Issues and Corrections:

- **Incorrect Logic in Conditional:**
  - The condition `if Max == k and n * Min <= k:` is problematic. The condition `n * Min <= k` should be `n * Min <= n` to ensure that Alice can afford to buy `Min` jewels at the price `Max`.
  - The correct logic should be:
    ```python
    if n // k >= k:
        number = k
        k = 0
    else:
        number = n // k
        k -= n // k
    ```
  - This ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible at the current stall price without exceeding the number of coins.

### Corrected Code:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        
        rep = 0
        tab = []
        
        while k > 0 and rep < 60 and n >= k:
            if n // k >= k:
                number = k
                k = 0
            else:
                number = n // k
                k -= n // k
            tab.append(str(number))
            n -= number * number
            rep += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            print('YES')
            print(len(tab))
            for i in tab:
                print(i, end=' ')
            print()  # Ensure a newline after the prices
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Final Evaluation:

- **Correctness:**
  - The original program had a logical error in the conditional logic inside the loop.
  - The corrected program ensures that Alice buys as many jewels as possible at each stall without exceeding the number of coins.
  - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases.

Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect due to the logical error in the conditional logic. The corrected version is provided above.
