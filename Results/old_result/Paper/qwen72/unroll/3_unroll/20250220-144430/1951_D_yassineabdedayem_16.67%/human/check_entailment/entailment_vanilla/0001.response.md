### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice has `n` coins and needs to buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - Bob can set up at most 60 stalls, each with a price per jewel.
   - Alice buys greedily, starting from the first stall and buying as many jewels as possible at each stall before moving to the next.

2. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes `rep` to count the number of stalls set up, `number` to store the price per jewel, and `tab` to store the prices of the stalls.
   - The program enters a loop where it tries to set up stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
   - In each iteration, it calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - If `Max` equals `k` and `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`, it sets `number` to `Min` and reduces `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and reduces `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends `number` to `tab`, subtracts `Min * Max` from `n`, and increments `rep`.
   - The loop continues until `n` is zero, `k` is zero, `rep` reaches 60, or `n` is less than `k`.

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - The loop ensures that `k` is reduced by the number of jewels Alice can buy at each stall.
   - The condition `n * Min <= k` is used to ensure that Alice can buy the required number of jewels without exceeding the number of coins.
   - The loop also ensures that `rep` does not exceed 60, which is the maximum number of stalls Bob can set up.

4. **Output:**
   - If `k` is zero after the loop, it means Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and their prices.
   - If `k` is not zero, it means it is impossible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "NO".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by breaking out of the loop and printing "NO".
   - It also handles the case where `k` is zero by printing "YES" and the stall prices.

6. **Complexity:**
   - The loop runs at most 60 times, which is within the constraints.
   - The operations inside the loop are simple arithmetic and list operations, which are efficient.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem constraints and logic. It ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the stalls and prices appropriately. The conditions and edge cases are handled correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
