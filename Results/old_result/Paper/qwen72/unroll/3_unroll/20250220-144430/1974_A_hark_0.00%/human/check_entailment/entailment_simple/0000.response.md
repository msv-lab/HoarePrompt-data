### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Looping:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a loop.

2. **Function 2 Logic:**
   - **Case 1: Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0:**
     - The program calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons (`bxsfory`) using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - It then updates `x` to account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is intended to adjust `x` by subtracting the space taken by 2x2 icons and adding the space they occupy.
     - The program then calculates the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons (`bxsfory1`), which is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise 0.
     - Finally, it prints the total number of screens required, which is the sum of `bxsfory` and `bxsfory1`.
   - **Case 2: `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0:**
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - **Case 3: `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0:**
     - The program correctly calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - **Case 4: Both `x` and `y` are 0:**
     - The program correctly prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

3. **Function 1:**
   - This function is not used in the program, so it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles all the cases as described in the problem statement.
- The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons is correct.
- The program correctly prints the minimal number of required screens for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
