Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

# Annotated Functions:
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are values of any type that can be compared using the < operator.
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b
    #The program returns the smaller value between `a` and `b` if `a` is less than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are values of any type that can be compared using the `<` operator. It returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: an integer between 1 and 83 (where `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`, and `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, and the output will be one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, and no changes are made to `x` and `y`.
        #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, and no changes are made to `x` and `y`.
    #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, and `bxsfory1` is set to `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is 0. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads two non-negative integers `x` and `y` from user input, where both `x` and `y` are between 0 and 99 inclusive. The function then prints an integer based on the following conditions:
- If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it prints the sum of `math.ceil(y / 2)` and `math.ceil((x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4) / 15) + 1` if the updated `x` is greater than 0, otherwise it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, it prints `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
- If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, it prints `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
- If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints 0.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the loop has executed the function `func_2` `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a non-negative integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) from user input and executes the function `func_2` `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged. The function itself does not return any value.
