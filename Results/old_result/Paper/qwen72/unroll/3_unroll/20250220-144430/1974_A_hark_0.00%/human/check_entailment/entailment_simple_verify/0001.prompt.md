You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the minimum number of screens required to place `x` applications with 1x1 icons and `y` applications with 2x2 icons.
   - Each screen is a 5x3 grid, which means it has 15 cells.
   - A 1x1 icon occupies 1 cell, and a 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells.

2. **Function 3:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` to compute the result.

3. **Function 2:**
   - This function reads the values of `x` and `y` for the current test case.
   - It handles four cases:
     - **Case 1:** Both `x` and `y` are greater than 0.
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
       - It then calculates the remaining cells after placing the 2x2 icons and adjusts `x` accordingly.
       - If `x` is still positive, it calculates the number of additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
       - The total number of screens is the sum of the screens needed for 2x2 icons and the additional screens needed for 1x1 icons.
     - **Case 2:** `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0.
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons using `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
     - **Case 3:** `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0.
       - It calculates the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
     - **Case 4:** Both `x` and `y` are 0.
       - It prints 0, indicating no screens are needed.

4. **Function 1:**
   - This function is not used in the program and can be ignored.

5. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons is correct (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
   - **Case 1 (continued):** The adjustment of `x` after placing 2x2 icons is incorrect. The formula `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is flawed. It should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` because each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells, and the remaining cells on the screen are 15 - 4 = 11.
   - **Case 2:** The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons when `x` is 0 is correct.
   - **Case 3:** The logic for calculating the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons when `y` is 0 is correct.
   - **Case 4:** The logic for handling the case where both `x` and `y` are 0 is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the flawed formula in Case 1. The correct formula should be `x = x - bxsfory * 11` instead of `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**
