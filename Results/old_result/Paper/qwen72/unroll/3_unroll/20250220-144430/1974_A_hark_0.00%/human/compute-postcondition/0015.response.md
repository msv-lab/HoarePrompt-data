Postcondition: ***`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, and no changes are made to `x` and `y`.***
