You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99.
def func_2():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > 0 and y > 0) :
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
        #This is printed: an integer between 1 and 83 (where `bxsfory1` is 0 if the updated `x` is less than or equal to 0, otherwise `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`, and `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`)
    else :
        if (x == 0 and y > 0) :
            print(math.ceil(y / 2))
            #This is printed: math.ceil(y / 2) (where y is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99)
        else :
            if (x > 0 and y == 0) :
                print(math.ceil(x / 15))
                #This is printed: math.ceil(x / 15) (where x is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 99, and the output will be one of the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7)
            else :
                print(0)
                #This is printed: 0
            #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input. If `x` > 0 and `y` == 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, and no changes are made to `x` and `y`.
        #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input. If `x` is 0 and `y` is greater than 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. If `x` is greater than 0 and `y` is 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`. Otherwise, either `x` is 0, or `y` is not 0, and no changes are made to `x` and `y`.
    #State: *`x` and `y` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99, and `x` and `y` are now assigned the values provided by the user input. If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, `x` is updated to `x - math.ceil(y / 2) * 15 + y * 4`, and `bxsfory1` is set to `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise `bxsfory1` is 0. If either `x` is 0 or `y` is 0, no changes are made to `x` and `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function does not accept any parameters. The output description is missing, so the functionality cannot be determined.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
