Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails when the number of extroverts (b) is not a multiple of 3 and the number of universals (c) is less than 2. In such cases, it is impossible to fulfill the extroverts' requirement of living in a tent with exactly two others. However, the program does not properly check for this condition and may output an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1
```
- There is 1 introvert, 1 extrovert, and 1 universal.
- The introvert will need 1 tent.
- The extrovert needs to live with 2 others, but there is only 1 universal available, which is not enough to fulfill the extrovert's requirement.
- The program should output -1, but it outputs 1, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
