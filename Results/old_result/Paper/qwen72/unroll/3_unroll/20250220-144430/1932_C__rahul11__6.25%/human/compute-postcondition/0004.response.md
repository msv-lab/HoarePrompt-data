Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), a positive integer `m` (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^4), a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^4, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'L' and 'R'. For each test case, it computes a list `res` of length `n` where the first element is the product of all integers in `a` modulo `m` and then further modulo `10^9 + 6`. Subsequent elements in `res` are computed by iteratively dividing the current product by elements in `a` based on the direction specified by the characters in `s` ('L' for left, 'R' for right), and then applying the same modulo operations. The function prints the `res` list for each test case. After processing all test cases, the `res` list for the last test case is printed, and the variables `ans`, `c`, `l`, and `r` are in their final states, with `ans` being 1 (or 0 if any division by zero occurred), `c` equal to `n`, `l` equal to `n` if all characters in `s` were 'R' or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise, and `r` equal to -1 if all characters in `s` were 'L' or some value between 0 and `n-1` otherwise. **
