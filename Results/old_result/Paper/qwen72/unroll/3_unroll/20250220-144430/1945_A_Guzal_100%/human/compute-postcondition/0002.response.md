Output State: **The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not retained between iterations, so they will be set to the last input values provided. The value of `k` is recalculated in each iteration based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. The loop will print a value of `k` for each iteration, and the final output state will be the last printed value of `k`.**
