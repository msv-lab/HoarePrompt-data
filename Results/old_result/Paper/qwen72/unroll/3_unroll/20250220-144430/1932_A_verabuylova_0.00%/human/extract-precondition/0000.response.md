Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples paths where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters representing the path. Each character in the string is either '.', '@', or '*', where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of each path is guaranteed to be empty.**

However, the provided function definition does not match the problem description. The function should be defined as follows to match the problem:

```python
def max_coins(t, paths):
```

Given this, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and paths is a list of tuples where each tuple contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of n characters representing the path. Each character in the string is either '.', '@', or '*', where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell of each path is guaranteed to be empty.**
