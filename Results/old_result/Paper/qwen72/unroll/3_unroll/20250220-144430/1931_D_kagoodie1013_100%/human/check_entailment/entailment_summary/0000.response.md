Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). 

The function `func_1` processes each test case as follows:
1. It initializes a counter `count` to zero, which will keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
2. It creates a dictionary `residue_map` to store the counts of pairs of residues \((r_x, r_y)\) where \(r_x\) is the residue of \(-num\) modulo \(x\) and \(r_y\) is the residue of \(num\) modulo \(y\).
3. For each number in the array, it calculates the residues \(r_x\) and \(r_y\).
4. It checks if the pair \((r_x, r_y)\) already exists in the `residue_map` and adds the count of such pairs to `count`.
5. It updates the `residue_map` with the current number's residues \((num \% x, num \% y)\).

However, there is a logical error in the program:
- The calculation of \(r_x\) as \(-num \% x\) is incorrect. The correct calculation should be \((x - num \% x) \% x\) to ensure that the residue is always non-negative and correctly represents the condition \(a_i + a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{x}\).
- The calculation of \(r_y\) as \(num \% y\) is correct for the condition \(a_i - a_j \equiv 0 \pmod{y}\).

Given this, the program will not correctly count the beautiful pairs as defined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
