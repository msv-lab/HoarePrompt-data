The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. It operates in an interactive environment where the input is a permutation of integers from 0 to n-1, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can make at most 3n queries, where each query involves four indices a, b, c, d (0 ≤ a, b, c, d < n). The goal of the function is to find two indices i and j (0 ≤ i, j < n) such that the XOR of p_i and p_j is maximized. The function returns these two indices i and j.
