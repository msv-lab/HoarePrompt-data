### Reasoning:

1. **Objective**: The goal is to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized, using at most \( 3n \) queries.

2. **Algorithm Overview**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it first identifies an index `maxi` that maximizes \( p_i \oplus p_i \) (which is always 0, but this step helps in finding the maximum value in the permutation).
   - It then creates a list `arr` of indices that have the same maximum value when ORed with `maxi`.
   - Finally, it finds the index `mini` in `arr` that minimizes \( p_i \oplus p_i \) (again, always 0, but this step helps in finding the minimum value in the permutation).

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Finding `maxi`**:
     - The function iterates through all indices \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{maxi}}) \) with \( (p_i \mid p_i) \).
     - Since \( p_i \mid p_i = p_i \), the function is essentially finding the maximum value in the permutation.
     - If \( p_i \) is greater than \( p_{\text{maxi}} \), `maxi` is updated to \( i \).

   - **Creating `arr`**:
     - The function then iterates through all indices \( i \) from 1 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( (p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_{\text{arr}[0]}) \) with \( (p_{\text{maxi}} \mid p_i) \).
     - This step is used to find all indices \( i \) such that \( p_i \) has the same maximum value when ORed with `maxi`.
     - If \( p_i \) is less than \( p_{\text{arr}[0]} \), `arr` is updated to contain only \( i \).
     - If \( p_i \) is equal to \( p_{\text{arr}[0]} \), \( i \) is appended to `arr`.

   - **Finding `mini`**:
     - The function iterates through all indices in `arr` and compares \( (p_{\text{mini}} \mid p_{\text{mini}}) \) with \( (p_{\text{item}} \mid p_{\text{item}}) \).
     - This step is used to find the minimum value in the permutation among the indices in `arr`.
     - If \( p_{\text{item}} \) is less than \( p_{\text{mini}} \), `mini` is updated to `item`.

   - **Output**:
     - The function outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` such that \( p_{\text{maxi}} \oplus p_{\text{mini}} \) is maximized.

4. **Query Count**:
   - The first loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The third loop makes at most \( n-1 \) queries.
   - Total queries: \( (n-1) + (n-1) + (n-1) = 3n - 3 \), which is within the limit of \( 3n \).

5. **Correctness**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the maximum value in the permutation and the minimum value among the indices that have the same maximum value when ORed with `maxi`.
   - The XOR of the maximum and minimum values in the permutation will indeed be maximized.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
