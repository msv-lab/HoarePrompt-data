The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop counter. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be at least 1.

Given the state before the loop starts, we do not need to adjust the function's operational environment, the input sequence, or the constraints on `n` and the queries. We only need to ensure that the loop will execute by adjusting the value of `int(input())`.

State: **`int(input())` must be at least 1**
