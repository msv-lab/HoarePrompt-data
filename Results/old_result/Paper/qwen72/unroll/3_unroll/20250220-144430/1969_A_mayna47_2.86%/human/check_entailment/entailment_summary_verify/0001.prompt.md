You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` from user input, where `n` represents the number of friends and `p` contains the best friend relationships. It then determines and prints the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. If `n` is 2, it prints 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`, it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the number of friends `n`.
   - It initializes a list `v` of size `n + 1` with zeros.
   - It then reads the list of best friends and appends it to `v` starting from index 1 (to make the indices 1-based).

3. **Special Case for `n == 2`:**
   - If there are only 2 friends, the program prints 2 and returns. This is correct because in this case, Monocarp must invite both friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

4. **Checking for Triplet Cycles:**
   - The program iterates through each friend `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - It checks if `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition is true if there is a cycle of length 3 (i.e., friend `i`'s best friend's best friend's best friend is `i`).
   - If such a cycle is found, the program prints 2 and returns. This is correct because in a cycle of length 3, inviting any 2 friends will ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

5. **Default Case:**
   - If no cycle of length 3 is found, the program prints 3. This is based on the assumption that the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the special case when `n == 2`.
- The program correctly identifies cycles of length 3 and prints 2 for such cases.
- However, the program does not handle other cases where the minimum number of invitations required might be less than 3. For example, if there are multiple pairs of friends who are each other's best friends, the program will still print 3, which is incorrect.

### Example:
- Consider the input `n = 4` and `p = [2, 1, 4, 3]`. Here, friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends, and friends 3 and 4 are each other's best friends. The program will print 3, but the correct answer is 2 because Monocarp can invite any one pair (e.g., friends 1 and 2) to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases where the minimum number of invitations required might be less than 3.

### Correctness:
**False**
