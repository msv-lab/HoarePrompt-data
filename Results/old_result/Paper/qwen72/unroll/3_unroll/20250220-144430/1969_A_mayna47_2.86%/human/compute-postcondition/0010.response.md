The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` and a list `p`. The integer `n` represents the number of friends, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 50`. The list `p` is of length `n` and contains integers where `1 ≤ p_i ≤ n`, `p_i ≠ i`, and all `p_i` are distinct. Each `p_i` represents the best friend of the i-th friend. The function returns the minimum number of invitations required to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a list `p` of integers, and returns the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.**
