Reasoning:  
The program aims to determine the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The logic is based on the following observations:

1. **Base Case (n = 2)**: If there are only 2 friends, Monocarp must invite both of them, so the program correctly prints 2.
2. **Triplet Check**: For `n > 2`, the program checks if there exists a triplet of friends `i`, `v[i]`, and `v[v[i]]` such that `v[v[v[i]]] == i`. This condition checks if there is a cycle of length 3 in the best friend relationships. If such a triplet exists, Monocarp can invite just 2 friends from this triplet to ensure that both come to the party, so the program correctly prints 2.
3. **Default Case**: If no such triplet exists, the program prints 3. This is because in the absence of a triplet, the minimum number of invitations required to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party is 3. This is because any pair of friends must be part of a larger cycle or a chain, and inviting 3 friends ensures that at least 2 of them will come.

However, the program has a logical flaw in the default case. It assumes that if no triplet exists, the minimum number of invitations required is always 3. This is not necessarily true. For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`. This forms a cycle of length 4, and inviting any 2 friends from this cycle will ensure that both come to the party. Therefore, the program should handle cycles of length 4 and other possible scenarios more robustly.

Given the provided execution summary and the problem description, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **False**
