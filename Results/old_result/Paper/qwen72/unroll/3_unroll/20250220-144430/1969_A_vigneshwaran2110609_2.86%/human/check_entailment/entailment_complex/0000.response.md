### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Logic for Mutual Best Friends:**
   - The function checks if there is a pair of friends who are mutual best friends by iterating through the list `l` and checking if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Output:**
   - The function prints the minimum number of invitations required for at least 2 friends to attend the party.
   - It prints `2` if there is at least one pair of mutual best friends, and `3` otherwise.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Correctness for Mutual Best Friends:**
  - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` correctly identifies pairs of mutual best friends. If `l[i]` is the best friend of `i`, and `l[l[i] - 1]` is `i`, then `i` and `l[i]` are mutual best friends.
  - If such a pair is found, Monocarp only needs to send 2 invitations to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.

- **Correctness for No Mutual Best Friends:**
  - If no such pair is found, the function prints `3`.
  - This is correct because if there are no mutual best friends, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure that at least 2 of them attend the party. This is because each friend requires their best friend to also receive an invitation, and without mutual pairs, sending invitations to 3 friends is the minimum to ensure at least 2 attend.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles the problem description and prints the minimum number of invitations required for each test case. It correctly identifies mutual best friends and prints `2` if such a pair exists, and `3` otherwise.

### Correctness:
**True**
