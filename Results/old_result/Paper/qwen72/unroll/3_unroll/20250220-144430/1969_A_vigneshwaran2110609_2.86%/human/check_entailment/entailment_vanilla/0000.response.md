### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `x` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Logic for Determining Minimum Invitations:**
   - The function iterates through the list `l` to check if there is a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.
   - It does this by checking if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` for any `i` in the range `[0, x)`.
   - If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` checks if the best friend of the `i`-th friend is the `i`-th friend itself. However, this is not the correct condition to check if two friends are each other's best friends.
  - The correct condition should be `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` to check if the best friend of the `i`-th friend is the `i`-th friend's best friend.
  - The current logic will incorrectly identify self-loops (which are not possible according to the problem constraints) as valid pairs.

- **Handling Test Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by reading `n` and then processing each test case individually.
  - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of invitations is flawed.

### Correct Solution:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends. If such a pair exists, Monocarp needs to send invitations to both friends in the pair, which is the minimum number of invitations (2). If no such pair exists, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        found_pair = False
        for i in range(x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                found_pair = True
                break
        if found_pair:
            print(2)
        else:
            print(3)
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it uses the wrong condition to check for pairs of friends who are each other's best friends.

Correctness: **False**
