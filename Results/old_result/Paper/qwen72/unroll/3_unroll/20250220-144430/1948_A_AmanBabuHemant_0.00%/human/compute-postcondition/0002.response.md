Output State: The function will print "NO" for odd values of `n` and for even values of `n` greater than or equal to 200. For even values of `n` less than 200, it will print "YES" followed by a string of '110' repeated `n // 2` times. The variable `t` will remain unchanged, and the variable `n` will hold the last input value that was processed in the loop. The variable `s` will hold the last generated string, which is '110' repeated `n // 2` times if `n` is even and less than 200, otherwise it will not be defined.
