### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to select \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) and prints \( n \) points.
   - The first two points are always \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
   - For \( i \) from 3 to \( n \), it prints \((i, i)\).

3. **Evaluating the Output:**
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{1\}\), which has size 1. This is incorrect because the maximum size should be 2.
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 2, 4\}\), which has size 3. This is correct.
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has size 5. This is correct.
   - For \( n = 5 \):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), and \((5, 5)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\}\), which has size 7. This is correct.
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     - The points are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((6, 6)\).
     - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\), which has size 9. This is correct.

4. **Generalizing the Pattern:**
   - The program always starts with \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), which ensures a distance of 1.
   - For \( i \) from 3 to \( n \), it prints \((i, i)\). This ensures that the distances between these points and the initial points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are distinct and increasing.
   - The pattern ensures that the distances between the points \((i, i)\) and \((j, j)\) for \( i \neq j \) are also distinct and increasing.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for \( n \geq 3 \).
   - However, the program does not handle the case \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it should output points that result in a set of distinct distances of size 2, not 1.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program fails to handle the case \( n = 2 \) correctly, as it should output points that result in a set of distinct distances of size 2, not 1. For \( n = 2 \), the correct output should be:
```
1 1
2 2
```
This would result in the set of distances \(\{1\}\), which has size 2.

Final: **False**
