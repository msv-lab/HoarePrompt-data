The only objects in the loop head are the variable `j` and the list `answers`. For the loop to execute, `answers` must contain at least one element. The variable `j` will take the value of the first element in `answers` at the start of the loop.

State: **`answers` is a list containing the results of each test case, where each result is either 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw', and `answers` must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `answers`**
