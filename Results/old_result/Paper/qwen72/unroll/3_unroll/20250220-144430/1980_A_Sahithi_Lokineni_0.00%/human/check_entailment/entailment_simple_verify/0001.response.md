### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Difficulties**:
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
   - However, the `default_value` function is not defined in the provided code. This is a critical error that would cause the program to fail when trying to initialize the `defaultdict`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Problems Needed**:
   - The program initializes `ans` to `0`.
   - It iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d` and checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum number of problems needed is incorrect. It should be checking if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m * 7` (since each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G').

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result `ans` for each test case.

5. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation mentions that the function `func_1` is not relevant to the problem and should not be part of the program. This is correct, and the function should be removed.
   - The annotation also correctly points out that the `default_value` function should be defined to return `0`.

### Correctness:
- **False**

### Explanation:
- The program has a critical error in the definition of `default_value`, which is not defined.
- The logic for calculating the minimum number of problems needed is incorrect. It should be checking if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m * 7` and not just `m`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def default_value():
    return 0

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(default_value)
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **default_value Function**: The `default_value` function is defined to return `0` for any key that is not already in the dictionary.
- **Correct Calculation**: The program iterates over the fixed set of difficulty levels 'A' to 'G' and checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than `m`. If it is, it adds the difference `m - d[val]` to `ans`.

This corrected program should now correctly determine the minimum number of problems needed to hold `m` rounds.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
