Output State: **The loop will print the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of each array `nums` for each test case. After all iterations, the variables `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last iteration, but the specific values of `x` and `y` will depend on the last array `nums` processed.**
