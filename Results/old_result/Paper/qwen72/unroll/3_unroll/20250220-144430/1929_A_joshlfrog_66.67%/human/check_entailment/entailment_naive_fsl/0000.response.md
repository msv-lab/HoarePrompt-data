Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem. The program only finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference, which is not the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array. To maximize this beauty, the optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and then calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. This is because the sorted array will have the largest possible differences between consecutive elements, thus maximizing the beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 1 3
```
The correct output should be 2, as explained in the problem description. However, the provided program will output 2 - 1 = 1, which is incorrect.

Another example:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The correct output should be 57, which can be achieved by sorting the array to [43, 54, 80, 90, 100] and calculating the beauty as (54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57. However, the provided program will output 100 - 43 = 57, which is coincidentally correct but for the wrong reason. This does not generalize to other cases where the maximum and minimum values are not the only elements contributing to the beauty.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
