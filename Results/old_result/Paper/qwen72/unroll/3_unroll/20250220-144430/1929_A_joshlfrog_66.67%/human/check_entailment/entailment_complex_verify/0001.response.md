Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The maximum beauty is achieved by arranging the array such that the largest element is followed by the smallest element, and this pattern continues.
   - For an array of length `n`, the maximum beauty is achieved by the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array, multiplied by `(n-1)`. This is because each difference `(a_i - a_{i-1})` can be maximized by the largest possible difference between any two elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array elements `nums`.
   - It initializes `x` to 0 (which will store the maximum element) and `y` to 100000000 (which will store the minimum element).
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum and minimum elements.
   - Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements of the array.
   - However, the program only prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is not the correct approach to calculate the maximum beauty of the array.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the sum of the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for the optimal arrangement, which is `(max - min) * (n-1)`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined by the problem statement.
   - The program prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is incorrect for the given problem.

Final: **False**
