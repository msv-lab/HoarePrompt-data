Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences.

However, the provided program only finds the maximum and minimum elements of the array and prints their difference. This approach does not consider the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and thus it does not compute the correct maximum beauty.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        nums.sort()
        beauty = sum(nums[i] - nums[i-1] for i in range(1, l))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

### Example:
For the input:
```
5
3
2 1 3
3
69 69 69
5
100 54 80 43 90
4
3 4 3 3
2
2 1
```

The output should be:
```
2
0
57
1
1
```

This is because:
- For the array `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting it gives `[1, 2, 3]`, and the beauty is \((2-1) + (3-2) = 2\).
- For the array `[69, 69, 69]`, sorting it gives `[69, 69, 69]`, and the beauty is \((69-69) + (69-69) = 0\).
- For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting it gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty is \((54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57\).
- For the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, sorting it gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, and the beauty is \((3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1\).
- For the array `[2, 1]`, sorting it gives `[1, 2]`, and the beauty is \((2-1) = 1\).

The provided program does not follow this approach and hence is incorrect.
