Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` (2 ≤ l ≤ 100) representing the length of the array, followed by `l` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) from the input. It then calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the variables `t`, `l`, `nums`, `x`, and `y` will retain their final values from the last test case processed. **
