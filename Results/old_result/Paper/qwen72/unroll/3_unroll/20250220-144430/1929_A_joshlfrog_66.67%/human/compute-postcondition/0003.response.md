The function `func` accepts two parameters: `t` and `a`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. `a` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains integers representing the elements of the array for each test case. Each inner list has a length `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), and each integer in the inner lists is constrained by 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and is determined based on the elements of the array for that test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `a` where each inner list contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. It returns a list of results, each corresponding to a test case based on the elements of the array for that test case.**
