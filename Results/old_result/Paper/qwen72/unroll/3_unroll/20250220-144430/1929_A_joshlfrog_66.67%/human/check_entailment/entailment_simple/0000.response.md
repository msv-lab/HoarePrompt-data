Reasoning:  
The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array in any way. The beauty is maximized when the array is sorted in ascending order, and the differences are calculated as follows: \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\). This simplifies to \(a_n - a_1\), which is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array.

The provided program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements of each array and prints their difference. However, it does not explicitly sort the array, which is unnecessary since the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

The program follows the input and output specifications correctly:
- It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
- For each test case, it reads the length of the array \(l\) and the elements of the array.
- It then finds the maximum and minimum elements of the array.
- Finally, it prints the difference between the maximum and minimum elements for each test case.

Given that the program's logic aligns with the problem's requirements and it produces the correct output for the given examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
