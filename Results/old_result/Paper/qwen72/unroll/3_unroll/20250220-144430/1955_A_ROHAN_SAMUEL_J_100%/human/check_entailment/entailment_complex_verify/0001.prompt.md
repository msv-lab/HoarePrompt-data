You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged, but the loop has printed the calculated values for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30) from the input. It then calculates and prints a result based on the following conditions: If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`. If `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`. If `n` is even and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Odd Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 1)**:
   - If `n` is odd, the program checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper. Therefore, the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price, which is `n // 2 * b + a`.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts (n % 2 == 0)**:
   - If `n` is even, the program again checks if the cost of buying two yogurts at the regular price (`2 * a`) is less than the promotion price (`b`).
     - If `2 * a < b`, it means buying each yogurt individually is cheaper. Therefore, the total cost is `a * n`.
     - Otherwise, the program calculates the cost of buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price, which is `n // 2 * b`.

4. **Output**:
   - For each test case, the program prints the minimum cost calculated.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Odd `n`**:
  - If `2 * a < b`, buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
  - If `2 * a >= b`, buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price and one additional yogurt at the regular price is cheaper, so the total cost is `n // 2 * b + a`.

- **Even `n`**:
  - If `2 * a < b`, buying each yogurt individually is cheaper, so the total cost is `a * n`.
  - If `2 * a >= b`, buying `n // 2` pairs of yogurts at the promotion price is cheaper, so the total cost is `n // 2 * b`.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is even, the program will print `n // 2 * b = 1 * 9 = 9`.
  - Correct output: `9`.

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is greater than `b = 9`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the program will print `n // 2 * b + a = 1 * 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Correct output: `14`.

- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is odd, the program will print `a * n = 5 * 3 = 15`.
  - Correct output: `15`.

- **Test Case 4**: `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - `2 * a = 10` which is less than `b = 11`.
  - Since `n` is even, the program will print `a * n = 5 * 4 = 20`.
  - Correct output: `20`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles both odd and even values of `n` and calculates the minimum cost based on the given conditions. The logic and output match the problem description and the provided example test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**
