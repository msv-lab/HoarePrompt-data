### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that Vasya's position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received during the settling are consistent with the described pattern.
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the numbers assigned to positions follow a specific sequence: \( 1, 2, \ldots, k, k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \).

2. **Input and Output:**
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers \( n \) and \( x \).
   - The output is the number of different \( k \) values that fit the given constraints.

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy the pattern.
   - If \( n \) is in the first \( k \) positions, \( x \) must be in the range \( 1 \) to \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is in the next \( k-2 \) positions, \( x \) must be in the range \( k-1 \) to \( 2 \).

4. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - The position \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = (2k - 2) \cdot m + p \) where \( m \) is a non-negative integer and \( p \) is the position within the current cycle.
   - The number \( x \) received by Vasya must match the position \( p \) within the cycle.

5. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is used to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and adds it to the list if it is.
   - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( \sqrt{q} \) and adds both the divisor and the quotient to the list if they meet the condition.

6. **Main Logic:**
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is odd. If it is, the answer is 0 because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.
   - It then calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find the possible values of \( k \).
   - If \( n \geq 3x - 2 \), it calls `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \) to find additional possible values of \( k \).
   - It combines the results, removes duplicates, and prints the length of the resulting list.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
  - It reads \( n \) and \( x \) for each test case.

- **Odd Check:**
  - The program correctly checks if \( y = n + x \) is odd and prints 0 if it is. This is correct because \( y \) must be even for the pattern to hold.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function correctly finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
  - It handles the square root check and the iteration through divisors correctly.
  - However, there is a minor issue in the square root check. The condition `w == w // 1` is not necessary because `w` is already an integer if it is a perfect square. The correct check should be `w.is_integer()` or simply `w == int(w)`.

- **Combining Results:**
  - The program combines the results from two calls to `func_1` and removes duplicates.
  - It prints the length of the resulting list, which is the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:

- **State of the program right before the function call:**
  - \( q \) and \( x \) are integers such that \( 1 \leq x < q \leq 10^9 \).
  - The function `func_1` is called with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \), and later with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).

- **Function `func_1` annotations:**
  - The function correctly initializes an empty list `M`.
  - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and adds it to the list if it is and it is greater than or equal to \( x-1 \).
  - It iterates through all integers from 1 to \( \sqrt{q} \) and adds both the divisor and the quotient to the list if they meet the condition.
  - The function returns the list `M` containing all valid divisors.

### Conclusion:

The program is mostly correct and follows the required logic. However, there is a minor issue in the square root check in the `func_1` function. The condition `w == w // 1` should be replaced with `w.is_integer()` or `w == int(w)` to ensure it works correctly for all cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Despite the minor issue in the square root check, the overall logic and structure of the program are correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
