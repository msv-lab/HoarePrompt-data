You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take input parameters as described in the problem, but the actual function definition is missing these parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters for the number of test cases `t`, the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. Each `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `P_B` and `P_S` are positive integers within the range of the permutation, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `a` is an array of positive integers.

    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, b, s = list(map(int, input().split()))

            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                break
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
            bm = max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)
            sm = max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)
            sp += a[s]
            bp += a[b]
        
        if bm > sm:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bm < sm:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
        
    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `t` is reduced by the number of iterations that were executed, and for each iteration, the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` are updated according to the loop body. Specifically, `b` and `s` are indices that are updated by following the permutation `p` and are decremented by 1. `bm` and `sm` are updated to the maximum possible values based on the current and previous values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` multiplied by `k`. `sp` and `bp` accumulate the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively. The loop prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm` for each iteration. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` are not directly affected by the loop, but their values within each iteration are used to compute the results.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads multiple test cases from the standard input. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of turns `k`, the starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` (adjusted to 0-based indices), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. It then calculates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` for two players (Bodya and Sasha) based on the permutation and the array, and prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' depending on which score is higher or if they are equal. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the game logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and positions for each player. The issue lies in the way the scores and positions are updated within the loop. The program should simulate the game for exactly `k` turns, but it incorrectly decrements `k` within the loop, which can lead to the game not being played for the full `k` turns.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

Expected Output:
```
Bodya
```

Actual Output:
```
Draw
```

In the provided input, the game should last for 2 turns. However, the program incorrectly updates the positions and scores, leading to an incorrect result. The correct simulation should show that Bodya ends up with a higher score, but the program incorrectly concludes a draw.
