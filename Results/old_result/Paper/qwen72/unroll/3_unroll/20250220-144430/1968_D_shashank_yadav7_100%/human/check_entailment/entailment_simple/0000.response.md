Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.

2. **Index Adjustment**:
   - The starting positions `P_B` and `P_S` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them from 1-based to 0-based indices, which is necessary for Python lists.

3. **Score Initialization**:
   - The scores `sp` and `bp` are initialized to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively, which is the score each player gets from their starting positions.

4. **Loop for Game Turns**:
   - The loop runs for `k` turns, decrementing `k` each time.
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated by following the permutation `p` and adjusting for 0-based indexing.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are updated based on the current and previous values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` multiplied by the remaining turns `k`.
   - The current scores `bp` and `sp` are accumulated by adding the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.

5. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After the loop, the function compares the final scores `bm` and `sm` and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The loop condition `k -= 1` and `if k == 0: break` is redundant because the loop already runs `k` times. The `break` statement is unnecessary and can be removed.
   - The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` to the maximum possible values based on the current and previous values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` is not entirely clear. The formula `a[b] * k + bp` and `a[s] * k + sp` seems to be an attempt to calculate the maximum possible score, but it is not clear why this specific formula is used.
   - The loop should not update `bm` and `sm` in the way it does. Instead, it should simply accumulate the scores `bp` and `sp` for each turn and then compare the final accumulated scores.

7. **Corrected Logic**:
   - The loop should only accumulate the scores `bp` and `sp` for each turn without trying to calculate the maximum possible scores.
   - The comparison should be based on the final accumulated scores `bp` and `sp`.

Given these points, the program is not entirely correct because of the issues with the score calculation and the redundant loop condition. The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` is flawed and should be simplified to just accumulate the scores.

Correctness: **False**
