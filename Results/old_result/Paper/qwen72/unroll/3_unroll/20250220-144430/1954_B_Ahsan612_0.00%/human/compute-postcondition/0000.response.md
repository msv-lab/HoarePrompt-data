The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range determined by the input. For the loop to execute, the input must be a positive integer. The state before the loop starts provides information about the expected input and the constraints, but these do not need to be adjusted directly. Instead, we need to ensure that the input is valid for the loop to execute.

Given the state before the loop starts, the loop will execute if the input is a positive integer. The variable `_` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration, up to the value provided by the input.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0, and the input must be a positive integer within the range 1 to t**
