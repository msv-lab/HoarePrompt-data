Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where an array is beautiful and can be made non-beautiful by removing the minimum number of elements. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```
The expected output is `1`, as explained in the problem description. However, the program will output `2` because it incorrectly updates the `same` counter and the `minn` variable.

The issue lies in the update logic of the `same` counter and the `minn` variable. The program should correctly identify the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the beauty condition, but it fails to do so in this case. The program increments `i` twice in some iterations, which can lead to skipping elements and incorrect counting. Additionally, the logic for updating `minn` is not correctly capturing the minimum number of elements to remove.
