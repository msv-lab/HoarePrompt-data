### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to infinity (`inf`), which will be used to track the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the array.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num`.
   - If they are equal, it increments the `same` counter.
   - If they are not equal, it moves to the next element, updates `num` to the next element, and updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - The `same` counter is reset to 1 for the new sequence of consecutive elements.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, the program updates `minn` one last time to ensure the last sequence of consecutive elements is considered.
   - If `minn` is still infinity, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same.

5. **Logic for Non-Beautiful Array**:
   - The program aims to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same. This is because removing elements from a sequence of consecutive elements can potentially break the "beautiful" property.
   - However, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array length is 1 or 2. For these cases, the array is already non-beautiful, and the program should output `-1`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array length is 1 or 2 correctly. For these cases, the array is already non-beautiful, and the program should output `-1`.

### Additional Analysis:
- **Array Length 1 or 2**:
  - If the array length is 1 or 2, the array is already non-beautiful because there are no indices `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ |a| - 1) that can be chosen to apply the operation.
  - The program should output `-1` for these cases, but it does not do so. Instead, it processes the array as if it were longer.

- **Correct Handling of Edge Cases**:
  - To correctly handle these edge cases, the program should include a check at the beginning of each test case to see if `n` is 1 or 2. If so, it should immediately print `-1` and move to the next test case.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Handle edge cases for array length 1 or 2
        if n <= 2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is correct in identifying that the program does not handle the edge cases where the array length is 1 or 2.
- The program is incorrect because it fails to output `-1` for these edge cases.

Final: **False**
