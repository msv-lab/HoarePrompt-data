Reasoning:  
The program's logic is flawed in its approach to determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. The program attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number, but this does not correctly address the problem. The issue is that the program does not consider the possibility of removing elements to break the "beautiful" property, which is defined by the ability to make all elements the same through a specific operation.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removals**:
   - The program calculates the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number, which is not the correct way to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
   - The program does not account for the possibility of removing elements to break the condition where `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced.

2. **Handling Arrays with All Elements the Same**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where all elements in the array are the same by printing `-1` because it is impossible to make such an array non-beautiful by removing elements.

3. **Handling Other Arrays**:
   - The program does not correctly handle arrays where the elements are not all the same but can still be made beautiful through the allowed operations. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program prints `1`, which is correct, but it does so for the wrong reason (it calculates the minimum segment length, not the minimum removals).

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to:
1. Identify if the array consists of all the same elements. If so, print `-1`.
2. Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same. This involves checking for the smallest segment where `a[i-1] = a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced, and then removing the minimum number of such elements to break this pattern.

### Example:
For the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the correct minimum number of elements to remove is `3` (removing the first three `3`s), as the program correctly outputs. However, the logic used to arrive at this answer is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not find the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, but rather it finds the minimum length of consecutive segments of the same number, which is not the same thing.

Correctness: **False**
