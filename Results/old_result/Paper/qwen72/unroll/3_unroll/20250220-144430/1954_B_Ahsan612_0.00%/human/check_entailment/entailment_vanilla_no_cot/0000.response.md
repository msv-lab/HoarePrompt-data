Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and counting consecutive elements that are the same. However, it does not correctly handle the logic required to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

### Issues:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Consecutive Elements**: The program incorrectly increments the index `i` and sets `num` to `ar[i]` before checking if `ar[i]` is equal to `num`. This can lead to skipping elements and incorrect counts.
2. **Handling of Beautiful Arrays**: The program does not correctly identify when the array is beautiful and when it can be made non-beautiful by removing elements. Specifically, it does not check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements in a way that breaks the condition `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly, such as arrays of length 1 or arrays where all elements are the same.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
1. Identify the pattern of the beautiful array.
2. Determine the minimum number of elements to remove to break the pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # If the array has only one element, it cannot be made non-beautiful
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Count the number of elements that are the same as their neighbors
        same_count = 0
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i] == ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                same_count += 1
        
        # If all elements are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful
        if all(x == ar[0] for x in ar):
            print(-1)
        else:
            # If there are no elements that can be removed to break the pattern, output 1
            if same_count == 0:
                print(1)
            else:
                # Otherwise, output the minimum number of elements to remove
                print(same_count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Edge Case for Single Element**: If the array has only one element, it cannot be made non-beautiful, so we output `-1`.
2. **Counting Same Elements**: We count the number of elements that are the same as their neighbors (i.e., `a_{i-1} = a_i = a_{i+1}`).
3. **Checking All Elements Same**: If all elements in the array are the same, it is impossible to make it non-beautiful, so we output `-1`.
4. **Minimum Removals**: If there are no elements that can be removed to break the pattern, we output `1` (since removing any one element will break the pattern). Otherwise, we output the count of such elements.

This approach ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.
