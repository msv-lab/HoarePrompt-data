The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The state before the loop starts does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
