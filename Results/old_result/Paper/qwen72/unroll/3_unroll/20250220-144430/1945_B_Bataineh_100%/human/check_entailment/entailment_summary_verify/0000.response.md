### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary in the context of the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes.
   - The goal is to find the maximum overlap of fireworks in the sky.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It then evaluates a series of conditions to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

3. **Function Summary:**
   - The function reads input values and prints results for each test case.
   - The input values remain unchanged after the function execution.

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are equal correctly.
   - Specifically, it claims that for `a == b`, the program should output `m // a + 2`, but it outputs `m // a + m // b + 2`.

5. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - **Case 1: `m < a` and `m < b`**
     - The program prints `2`.
     - This is correct because if the visibility duration `m + 1` is less than both launch frequencies `a` and `b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 2 (one from each installation).

   - **Case 2: `m < a` and `m > b`**
     - The program prints `2 + m // b`.
     - This is correct because if `m` is greater than `b` but less than `a`, the second installation will launch more fireworks within the visibility window of the first installation, and the maximum number of visible fireworks will be `2 + m // b`.

   - **Case 3: `m < b` and `m > a`**
     - The program prints `2 + m // a`.
     - This is correct because if `m` is greater than `a` but less than `b`, the first installation will launch more fireworks within the visibility window of the second installation, and the maximum number of visible fireworks will be `2 + m // a`.

   - **Case 4: `m >= a` and `m >= b`**
     - The program prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.
     - This is incorrect for the case where `a == b`. When `a == b`, the installations launch fireworks at the same times, and each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes. Therefore, the maximum number of visible fireworks should be `m // a + 2` (since each installation will launch the same number of fireworks, and they will all overlap).

6. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input:
     ```
     1
     1 1 1000000000000000000
     ```
     - The expected output is `2000000000000000002` because both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for `1000000000000000001` minutes.
     - The program outputs `2000000000000000000` because it calculates `m // a + m // b + 2`, which is `1000000000000000000 + 1000000000000000000 + 2`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are equal correctly, leading to incorrect results in such scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
