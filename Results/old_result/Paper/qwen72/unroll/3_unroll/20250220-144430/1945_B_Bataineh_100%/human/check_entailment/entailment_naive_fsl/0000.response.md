Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` are equal correctly. According to the problem description, if both installations have the same launch frequency (`a == b`), the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously is `m // a + 2` because both installations will launch fireworks at the same times, and each firework will be visible for `m + 1` minutes. However, the program does not account for this specific case and will produce incorrect results.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1000000000000000000
```
The expected output is `2000000000000000002`, but the program will output `2000000000000000000` because it does not correctly handle the case where `a == b`.
