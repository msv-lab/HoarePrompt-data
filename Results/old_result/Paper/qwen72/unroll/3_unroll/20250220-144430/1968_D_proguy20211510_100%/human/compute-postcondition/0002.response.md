Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each of the t test cases, n, k, P_B, P_S are integers such that 1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. p is a permutation of length n consisting of integers from 1 to n. a is an array of length n consisting of integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'. MOD is 1000000007. `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**

The variable `alpha` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
