Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the score for each player by multiplying the score at each position by `(k - i)`, which is not how the game rules are defined.

According to the problem description, the score for each player is increased by the value at their current position, and then they can either stay at the current position or move to the position specified by the permutation. The program should simulate the game for exactly `k` turns, keeping track of the score at each turn and the position of each player.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Adjust positions to be 0-indexed
        pb -= 1
        ps -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        score_b = 0
        score_s = 0
        
        # Initialize positions
        pos_b = pb
        pos_s = ps
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            score_b += a[pos_b]
            score_s += a[pos_s]
            
            # Decide whether to stay or move
            if a[p[pos_b] - 1] > a[pos_b]:
                pos_b = p[pos_b] - 1
            if a[p[pos_s] - 1] > a[pos_s]:
                pos_s = p[pos_s] - 1
        
        # Determine the winner
        if score_b > score_s:
            print('Bodya')
        elif score_s > score_b:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Position Adjustment**: The positions `pb` and `ps` are adjusted to be 0-indexed, as Python lists are 0-indexed.
2. **Score Calculation**: The score for each player is updated by adding the value at their current position in the array `a`.
3. **Movement Decision**: The player moves to the position specified by the permutation `p` if the score at the new position is greater than the score at the current position.
4. **Turn Simulation**: The game is simulated for exactly `k` turns, and the scores are compared after the simulation to determine the winner.

This corrected version should accurately determine the winner of the game based on the problem description.
