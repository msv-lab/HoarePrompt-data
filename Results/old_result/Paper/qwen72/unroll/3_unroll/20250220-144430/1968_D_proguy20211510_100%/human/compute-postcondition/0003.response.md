The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. The loop will execute based on the value returned by `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0. 

Given the state before the loop starts, the variable `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This means that `int(input())` should be `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `_` is 0**
