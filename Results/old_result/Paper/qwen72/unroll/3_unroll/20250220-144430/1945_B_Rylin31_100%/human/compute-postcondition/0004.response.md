Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^18, and prints the sum of the integer division of `m` by `a`, the integer division of `m` by `b`, and 2. The values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not retained after each iteration. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value. **
