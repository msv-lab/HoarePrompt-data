Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The program simply calculates the sum of the number of times each installation can launch fireworks within \( m \) minutes and adds 2, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should consider the overlap of the visibility periods of the fireworks launched by both installations. Specifically, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously, which involves understanding the least common multiple (LCM) of the launch intervals and the visibility period.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the least common multiple of a and b
        l = lcm(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of times each installation can launch fireworks within l minutes
        count_a = l // a
        count_b = l // b
        # Calculate the total number of fireworks visible at the same time within l minutes
        max_fireworks = count_a + count_b - 1
        # Calculate the number of full cycles within m minutes
        full_cycles = m // l
        # Calculate the remaining time after full cycles
        remaining_time = m % l
        # Calculate the number of additional fireworks visible in the remaining time
        additional_fireworks = (remaining_time // a) + (remaining_time // b) + 1
        # The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the maximum of the full cycles and the remaining time
        print(max(full_cycles * max_fireworks, additional_fireworks))

func()
```

Explanation:
1. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: We use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two launch intervals \( a \) and \( b \). The LCM helps us determine the period after which the two installations will launch fireworks at the same time.
2. **Counting Fireworks in LCM Period**: We calculate how many fireworks each installation can launch within one LCM period.
3. **Total Fireworks in LCM Period**: The total number of fireworks visible at the same time within one LCM period is the sum of the fireworks launched by both installations minus one (since the first firework from each installation will overlap).
4. **Full Cycles and Remaining Time**: We calculate the number of full LCM periods within \( m \) minutes and the remaining time after these full periods.
5. **Additional Fireworks in Remaining Time**: We calculate the number of additional fireworks that can be seen in the remaining time.
6. **Maximum Fireworks**: The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is the maximum of the fireworks in the full cycles and the additional fireworks in the remaining time.

This approach ensures that we correctly account for the overlap and the visibility periods of the fireworks.
