Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

### Explanation:
- The program calculates `m // a + m // b + 2` for each test case.
- `m // a` and `m // b` count the number of times the first and second installations can launch fireworks within the first `m` minutes, respectively.
- The `+ 2` is added to account for the possibility of both installations launching a firework at the same time, but this is not the correct approach to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

### Correct Approach:
- To find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time, you need to consider the overlap of the visibility periods of the fireworks.
- The visibility period of a firework launched by the first installation at time `x` is `[x, x + m]`.
- The visibility period of a firework launched by the second installation at time `y` is `[y, y + m]`.
- The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time can be determined by finding the maximum overlap of these periods.

### Example Calculation:
- For the input `6 7 4`, the first installation launches fireworks at times `6, 12, 18, ...` and the second at times `7, 14, 21, ...`.
- The visibility periods for the first installation are `[6, 10], [12, 16], [18, 22], ...`.
- The visibility periods for the second installation are `[7, 11], [14, 18], [21, 25], ...`.
- The maximum overlap occurs at time `7` where both installations have fireworks visible, resulting in a maximum of `2` fireworks visible at the same time.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the first time both installations launch a firework simultaneously. Then, you need to calculate the number of fireworks visible at the time of the first simultaneous launch and the time just before the next simultaneous launch.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = (m + 1) // a + (m + 1) // b - (m + 1) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
- `lcm(a, b)` calculates the least common multiple of `a` and `b`.
- `(m + 1) // a` and `(m + 1) // b` count the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the first `m + 1` minutes.
- `(m + 1) // l` subtracts the number of times both installations launch a firework simultaneously, as these should not be double-counted.

This approach correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
