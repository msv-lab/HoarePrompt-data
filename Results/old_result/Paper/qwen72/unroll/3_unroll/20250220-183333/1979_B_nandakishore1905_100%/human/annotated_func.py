        n, m = map(int, input().split())

    #State: The values of x and y remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop. The loop processes inputs n and m, and for each iteration, it prints a value based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The loop does not alter the initial state of x and y.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it reads an integer from the user, which determines the number of iterations. For each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `n` and `m` from the user, computes the absolute difference `k` between them, and prints a value based on the following conditions: if `k` is a power of 2, it prints `k`; if `k` is odd, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `k` after subtracting all smaller powers of 2 from `k`. The function does not modify any external variables or the initial state of the program.
