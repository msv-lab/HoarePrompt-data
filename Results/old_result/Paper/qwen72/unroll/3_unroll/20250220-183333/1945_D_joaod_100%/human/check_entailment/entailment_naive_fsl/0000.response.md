Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost to bribe people and move to the desired position is flawed. The program incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost to move to a position is the sum of the minimum costs encountered while iterating backward through the queue. However, this approach does not consider the optimal substructure of the problem, which is essential for a correct solution.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The expected output is `14`, but the program outputs `11`.

**Explanation:**
- Kirill starts at position 5 (end of the line).
- To move to position 2, Kirill can:
  - Move to position 4 and pay `9` coins.
  - Move to position 3 and pay `8` coins.
  - Move to position 2 and pay `3` coins.
- The total cost is `9 + 8 + 3 = 20`.

However, the optimal solution is:
- Move to position 4 and pay `9` coins.
- Move to position 2 and pay `3` coins.
- The total cost is `9 + 3 + 2 = 14`.

The program fails to correctly calculate the minimum cost in this scenario.
