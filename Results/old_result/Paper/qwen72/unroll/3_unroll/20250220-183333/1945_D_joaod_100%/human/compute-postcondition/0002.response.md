Output State: **The loop iterates through each case, and for each case, it calculates the minimum cost to move an element from a position `na_frente` to a position `pos_final` using the costs provided in `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`. After all iterations, the variable `best` holds the minimum cost for the current case, and this value is printed. The variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `custo_pra_trocar_a`, `custo_pra_passar_b`, and `total` are reset for each new case. The loop variable `c` will have incremented by 1 for each iteration, and after the loop finishes, `c` will be equal to `cases`.**
