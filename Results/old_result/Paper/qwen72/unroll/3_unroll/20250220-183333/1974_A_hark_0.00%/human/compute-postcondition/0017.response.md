The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might use or return values for `x` and `y`, which are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y <= 99. Since the output is not specified, it is not clear what the function returns. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to operate with non-negative integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 99, but the specific return value or behavior is not provided.

Functionality: **The function operates with non-negative integers `x` and `y` within the range 0 to 99, but the specific return value or behavior is not provided.**
