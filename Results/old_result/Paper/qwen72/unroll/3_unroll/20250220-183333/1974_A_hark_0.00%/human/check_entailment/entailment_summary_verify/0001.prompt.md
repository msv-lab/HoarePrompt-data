You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a non-negative integer `t` from the user input where 1 <= t <= 10^4. It then calls the function `func_2` exactly `t` times. After the function concludes, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and `func_2` has been called `t` times.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Logic for Handling Icons**:
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed to place all the 2x2 icons first. Since each screen can fit at most 2 of these 2x2 icons (each occupying 4 cells), the number of screens required for 2x2 icons is `math.ceil(y / 2)`.
   - After placing the 2x2 icons, the program updates the number of remaining cells that can be used for 1x1 icons. Each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns), and each 2x2 icon occupies 4 cells. Therefore, after placing `y` 2x2 icons, the number of remaining cells is `15 * math.ceil(y / 2) - y * 4`.
   - The program then subtracts the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons from the total number of cells available in the screens used for 2x2 icons, and adds the number of cells occupied by the 2x2 icons to the remaining cells needed for 1x1 icons. This is done with the line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`.

3. **Handling Remaining 1x1 Icons**:
   - If there are any remaining 1x1 icons (`x > 0`), the program calculates the number of additional screens needed to place these icons using `math.ceil(x / 15)`.
   - The program then prints the total number of screens required, which is the sum of the screens used for 2x2 icons and the screens used for the remaining 1x1 icons.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x == 0` and `y > 0`, the program correctly prints the number of screens needed for the 2x2 icons.
   - If `x > 0` and `y == 0`, the program correctly prints the number of screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - If both `x == 0` and `y == 0`, the program correctly prints `0`.

5. **Overall Structure**:
   - The program is structured to handle multiple test cases using a loop.
   - The logic for calculating the number of screens is encapsulated in `func_2`, and the main function `func_3` calls `func_2` for each test case.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - The line `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` seems to be incorrect. It should be `x = x - (bxsfory * 15 - y * 4)` to correctly calculate the remaining 1x1 icons after placing the 2x2 icons.
   - The line `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` should be `bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15)` to correctly calculate the number of additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.
