Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept two parameters: an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) representing the number of friends, and a list of integers `p` of length `n` (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, all p_i are distinct) representing the best friends of each friend. The function should be called multiple times with different values of `n` and `p`, as specified by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases. `n` is now an input integer, and `n` is not equal to 2. `v` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as 0 and the remaining elements as integers provided by the input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
        print(2)
        return


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
