The provided Python code snippet is a simple `print` statement that outputs the integer `2`. The initial state describes a function that accepts parameters `n` and `p`, and a list `v` of length `n + 1` initialized with the first element as `0` and the remaining elements as integers provided by the input. However, the `print` statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or the function's logic.

Output: **2**
