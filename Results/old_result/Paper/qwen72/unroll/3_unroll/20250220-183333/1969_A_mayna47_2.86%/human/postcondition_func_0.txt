The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `p` from the input. It then checks if the best friend relationships represented by `p` form a valid cycle of length 3. If `n` is 2, it prints 2 and returns. If `n` is greater than 2 and a valid cycle of length 3 is found, it prints 2 and returns. If no valid cycle of length 3 is found, it prints 3 and returns. The function does not modify the input values `n` and `p`.
