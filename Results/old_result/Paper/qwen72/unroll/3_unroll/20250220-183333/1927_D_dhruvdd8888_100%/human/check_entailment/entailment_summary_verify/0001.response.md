### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `N`.
   - It reads the array `nums` and appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of the array. This sentinel value is used to ensure the last group of identical elements is processed.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It creates an empty list `arr` to store tuples of the form `(start, end, number)`.

3. **Building the `arr` List:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and groups consecutive identical elements.
   - For each group, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`, where `1 + s` is the start index of the group, `i` is the end index of the group, and `num` is the value of the elements in the group.
   - It updates `s` to the current index `i` and `num` to the current element `nums[i]`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index is greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It retrieves the tuple `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if there is a pair of different elements within the range `(l, r)`:
     - **Condition 1: `s > l`**
       - This means the start of the current group is greater than `l`.
       - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it means the group starts at the beginning or outside the range, so no valid pair exists.
       - Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)` as a valid pair.
     - **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
       - This means the end of the current group is greater than or equal to `r`.
       - If this is true, it means the entire range `(l, r)` is within a single group of identical elements, so no valid pair exists.
     - **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
       - This means the end of the current group is within the array and not before `l`.
       - It prints `(s, e + 1)` as a valid pair.
     - **Else:**
       - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `s > l`**
  - This condition checks if the start of the current group is greater than `l`. If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it correctly identifies that the group starts at the beginning or outside the range, so no valid pair exists.
  - If `s > l` and `s <= r`, it correctly prints `(s - 1, s)` as a valid pair, indicating that the previous element and the current element are different.

- **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
  - This condition checks if the end of the current group is greater than or equal to `r`. If true, it correctly identifies that the entire range `(l, r)` is within a single group of identical elements, so no valid pair exists.

- **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
  - This condition checks if the end of the current group is within the array and not before `l`. If true, it correctly prints `(s, e + 1)` as a valid pair, indicating that the current group and the next group have different elements.

- **Else:**
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it correctly prints `-1 -1`, indicating that no valid pair exists.

### Issues:
- **Appending Sentinel Value:**
  - The sentinel value `-1` is necessary to ensure the last group of identical elements is processed correctly. Without it, the last group might not be added to `arr`.

- **Indexing and Conditions:**
  - The conditions and indexing logic are correctly implemented to handle the problem requirements. The use of `bisect_left` and the subsequent checks are appropriate for finding the correct segment.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program does not separate outputs for different test cases with empty lines, which is not a mandatory requirement but might be expected for clarity. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is correctly implemented to handle the problem requirements. The conditions for determining valid pairs are robust and cover all edge cases. The sentinel value is necessary and does not introduce unnecessary complexity.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
