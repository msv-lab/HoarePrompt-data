### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - It reads the length of the array `N` and the array `nums`.
   - It appends a sentinel value `-1` to the end of `nums` to handle the edge case where the last element of `nums` is different from the previous elements.
   - It initializes variables `s` (start index), `e` (end index), and `num` (current number).
   - It creates an empty list `arr` to store tuples of the form `(start, end, number)`.

3. **Building the `arr` List:**
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and groups consecutive identical elements.
   - For each group, it appends a tuple `(1 + s, i, num)` to `arr`, where `1 + s` is the start index of the group, `i` is the end index of the group, and `num` is the value of the elements in the group.
   - It updates `s` to the current index `i` and `num` to the current element `nums[i]`.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `q`.
   - For each query, it reads the range `(l, r)`.
   - It uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the start index is greater than or equal to `l`.
   - It retrieves the tuple `(s, e, _)` from `arr` at the index `min(eli, LA)`, where `LA` is the length of `arr` minus one.
   - It checks various conditions to determine if there is a pair of different elements within the range `(l, r)`:
     - **Condition 1: `s > l`**
       - This means the start of the current group is greater than `l`.
       - If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it means the group starts at the beginning or outside the range, so no valid pair exists.
       - Otherwise, it prints `(s - 1, s)` as a valid pair.
     - **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
       - This means the end of the current group is greater than or equal to `r`.
       - If this is true, it means the entire range `(l, r)` is within a single group of identical elements, so no valid pair exists.
     - **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
       - This means the end of the current group is within the array and not before `l`.
       - It prints `(s, e + 1)` as a valid pair.
     - **Else:**
       - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.

### Analysis of Conditions:
- **Condition 1: `s > l`**
  - This condition is used to check if the start of the current segment is greater than `l`. If `s == 1` or `s > r`, it means the segment starts at the beginning or outside the range, so no valid pair exists.
  - This condition is logically sound for the purpose of finding a valid pair.

- **Condition 2: `e >= r`**
  - This condition checks if the end of the current segment is greater than or equal to `r`. If true, it means the entire range `(l, r)` is within a single group of identical elements, so no valid pair exists.
  - This condition is also logically sound.

- **Condition 3: `e < N` or `e < l`**
  - This condition checks if the end of the current segment is within the array and not before `l`.
  - It prints `(s, e + 1)` as a valid pair.
  - This condition is logically sound for finding a valid pair.

- **Else:**
  - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints `-1 -1`.
  - This is a catch-all condition that ensures the program outputs `-1 -1` when no valid pair is found.

### Issues:
- **Appending Sentinel Value:**
  - The sentinel value `-1` is appended to `nums` to handle the edge case where the last element of `nums` is different from the previous elements. This is a valid approach to ensure the last segment is processed correctly.
  - However, it is important to verify that this does not introduce any unintended behavior.

- **Indexing and Conditions:**
  - The conditions and indexing logic are designed to handle the problem requirements. The use of `bisect_left` and the conditions are appropriate for finding the correct segments and determining if a valid pair exists.
  - The conditions are robust and cover the necessary edge cases.

- **Output Format:**
  - The program does not separate outputs for different test cases with empty lines, which is not a mandatory requirement but might be expected for clarity.
  - This is a minor issue and does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic is sound and correctly handles the problem requirements. The conditions for determining valid pairs are robust and cover all necessary edge cases. The use of the sentinel value `-1` is a valid approach to ensure the last segment is processed correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct and handles all edge cases as required by the problem description. The original assessment was inaccurate in suggesting that the program might not handle all edge cases correctly. The conditions and logic are well-designed and robust.

Final: **True**
