The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It accepts the following parameters for each test case:

- `t`: An integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, representing the length of the array `a`.
- `a`: A list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
- `q`: An integer where 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, representing the number of queries.
- `queries`: A list of `q` pairs of integers `(l, r)` where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.

The function processes each test case and returns the results for each query. The exact return value for each query is not specified in the provided information, but it is implied that the function will return some value based on the array `a` and the query ranges `(l, r)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` representing the length of an array `a`, the array `a` itself, an integer `q` representing the number of queries, and a list of `q` query pairs `(l, r)`. For each query, the function returns a result based on the elements of the array `a` within the range `[l, r]`.**
