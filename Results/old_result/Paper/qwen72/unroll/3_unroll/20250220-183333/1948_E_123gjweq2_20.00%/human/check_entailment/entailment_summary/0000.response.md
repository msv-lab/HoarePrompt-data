### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to assign distinct integers from 1 to n to the vertices of a graph.
   - We then add edges between vertices (i, j) if \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \).
   - The goal is to partition the graph into the minimum number of cliques and print the partition.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(n, k)`**:
     - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)`.
     - It initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.
     - It calls `make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)` for each clique.
     - It prints the list `arr`, the number of cliques, and the list `cliquess`.

   - **`make_array(left, right, clique)`**:
     - It updates the `arr` list with a specific pattern.
     - The first half of the range from `left` to `right` is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1`.
     - The second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`.
     - The `cliquess` list is updated to contain the value `clique` for all indices from `left` to `right + 1`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Clique Calculation**:
     - The number of cliques is calculated as `ceil(n / k)`, which is correct because it ensures that each segment of length `k` is treated as a potential clique.
   
   - **Array Filling**:
     - The function `make_array` fills the `arr` list with a pattern that ensures the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met.
     - The first half of the segment is filled with increasing values, and the second half with decreasing values. This pattern ensures that the difference \( |a_i - a_j| \) is minimized within each segment, making it easier to form cliques.
     - The `cliquess` list is correctly updated to reflect the clique assignment for each vertex.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output of `func_1` should match the problem requirements:
     - The first line should contain `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
     - The second line should contain the number of cliques.
     - The third line should contain the clique assignments for each vertex.

5. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `k` is large enough to form a single clique for all vertices (e.g., `k >= n`).
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is small, resulting in multiple cliques.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly assigns distinct integers to the vertices, calculates the number of cliques, and prints the clique assignments. The specific pattern used in `make_array` ensures that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is met, allowing the graph to be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Correctness:
**True**
