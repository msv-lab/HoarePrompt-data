Reasoning:

The program as provided does not match the problem description in several critical ways:

1. **Function Definition and Call**: The program defines a function `func_1` but does not correctly match the problem's requirement for handling multiple test cases. The function should be defined to accept the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Instead, it is called in a loop without any arguments, and the function itself reads input directly, which is not a good practice for a function that should be reusable and testable.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The MEX (Minimum EXcludant) is calculated incorrectly. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the prefix of the permutation `p`. However, the program attempts to construct the permutation `p` by directly manipulating `minn` and `maxx` without correctly ensuring that the MEX condition is satisfied for each element in `arr`.

3. **Permutation Construction**: The program does not correctly construct the permutation `p` that satisfies the condition `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`. Instead, it constructs a list `mex` which is not the permutation `p` but rather a list of values that are supposed to be the MEX values for each prefix of `p`. This list is then printed, which is incorrect because the output should be the permutation `p`.

4. **Handling of Negative Values**: The handling of negative values in the array `arr` is incorrect. The program attempts to append `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex`, but this does not correctly reflect the MEX calculation for the permutation.

5. **Output Format**: The program prints the values of `mex` instead of the permutation `p`. The output format is incorrect according to the problem statement.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
