Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the given array `a`. Specifically, the logic for updating `minn` and `maxx` and appending values to `mex` is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
5
1 1 -2 1 2
```

Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
```

Actual Output from the program:
```
0 1 3 2 4
```

The program fails to correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a`. The issue lies in how the program handles the MEX calculation and the construction of the permutation. The program does not correctly account for the MEX value and the relationship between `p_i` and `a_i` in all cases.
