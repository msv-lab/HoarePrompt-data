Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(arr) <= 2 * 10^5, and each element a_i in `arr` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9; `A` is True if the difference between consecutive elements in `set_` is always 1, otherwise `A` is False; `set_` is a sorted list containing the unique elements from `arr`, and the first element of `set_` is 1; `not_c` is False if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `set_` with a difference greater than 1, otherwise `not_c` is True.
