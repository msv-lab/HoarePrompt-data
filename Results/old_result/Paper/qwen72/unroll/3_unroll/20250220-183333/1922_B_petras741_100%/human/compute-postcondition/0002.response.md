To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0, and `i` will start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `buffer` is an empty list.

The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `i` is automatically initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function, we don't need to adjust `i`.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `t` is greater than 0, and `i` is 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `buffer` is an empty list**
