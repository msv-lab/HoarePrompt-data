The function `solve` is expected to read input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of testcases, and each of the following t lines contains a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 5000) consisting only of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. The total length of the strings over all testcases does not exceed 5000.
