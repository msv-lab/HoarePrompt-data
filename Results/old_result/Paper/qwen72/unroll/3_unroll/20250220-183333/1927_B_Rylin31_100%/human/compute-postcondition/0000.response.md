The only objects in the loop head are the variable `i` and the result of `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, the result of `int(input())` must be at least 1, as this represents the number of test cases `t`.

Given the state before the loop starts, we know that the function `func` is expected to take input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. This means that the input provided to `int(input())` should be a valid integer within the specified range.

To ensure the loop executes, the input must be a positive integer (i.e., at least 1). The variable `i` will start at 0, as it is the default behavior of `range`.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4)**
