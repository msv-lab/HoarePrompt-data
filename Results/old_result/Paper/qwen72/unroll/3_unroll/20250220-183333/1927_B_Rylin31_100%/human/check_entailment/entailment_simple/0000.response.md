### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `l` and the trace array `array`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The function initializes a list `s` of length `l` with all elements set to 0. This list will keep track of the number of occurrences of each character in the string being constructed.

3. **String Construction:**
   - The function iterates over each element `j` in the trace array `array`.
   - For each `j`, it appends the character corresponding to `s[j]` (converted to a character using `chr(s[j] + 97)`) to the result string `ans`.
   - It then increments `s[j]` by 1 to update the count of occurrences of the character.

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the string for each test case, the function prints the result string `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The trace array `array` is designed such that `array[i]` represents the number of previous occurrences of the character at position `i` in the string.
- The list `s` is used to keep track of these occurrences. When `array[i]` is `j`, it means the character at position `i` should be the `j`-th occurrence of some character.
- The function correctly maps each `j` to a character using `chr(s[j] + 97)`, where `97` is the ASCII value of 'a'. This ensures that the characters are from 'a' to 'z'.
- The function updates `s[j]` after each character is added to `ans`, which correctly maintains the count of occurrences.

### Edge Cases:
- **Single Character String:**
  - If `n = 1` and `array = [0]`, the function correctly outputs a single character string, e.g., "a".
- **All Zeros Trace:**
  - If `array` is all zeros, the function correctly outputs a string with all the same characters, e.g., "aaaaaaa".
- **Max Trace Values:**
  - If `array` contains values from `0` to `n-1`, the function correctly outputs a string with unique characters, e.g., "abcdefgh".

### Conclusion:
The function correctly reconstructs a string from the given trace array for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem description.
