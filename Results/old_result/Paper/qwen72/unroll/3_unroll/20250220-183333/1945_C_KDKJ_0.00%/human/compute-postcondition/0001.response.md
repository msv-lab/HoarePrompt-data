Output State: None of the variables are used in the function signature. 

The loop iterates a number of times specified by the user input, and each iteration calls the function `func_1()`. However, since no variables are defined or modified within the loop head or body, the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
