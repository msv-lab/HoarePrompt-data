Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's in the string `a` and stores them in a list `S`. The function then finds an index `i` (if any) such that the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to that index and from that index to the end of the string satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, it looks for an index where the number of '0's is less than half the total count up to that index, and the number of '1's is less than half the total count from that index to the end. If such an index is found, it prints that index; otherwise, it prints 0. The list `S` and the variable `satisfy` remain unchanged throughout the function. **
