Output State: **None of the variables are used in the function signature.**

Explanation: The loop iterates a certain number of times based on the input provided. However, the loop body only calls the function `func_1()`, and since no variables are modified or used within the loop head or body, the initial state remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
