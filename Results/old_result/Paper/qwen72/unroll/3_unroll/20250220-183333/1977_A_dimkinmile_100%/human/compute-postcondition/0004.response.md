Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, with the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 100.
- The condition `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0` is true.

Let's break down the condition:

1. `(n - m) % 2 != 0` means that the difference between `n` and `m` is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd).
2. `n - m < 0` means that `n` is less than `m`.

If either of these conditions is true, the code will execute the `print('No')` statement.

Since the precondition states that either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0` is true, the `print('No')` statement will always be executed.

Output: **No**
