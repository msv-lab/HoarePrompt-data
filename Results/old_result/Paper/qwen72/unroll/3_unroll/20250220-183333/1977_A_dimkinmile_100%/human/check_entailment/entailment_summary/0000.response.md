Reasoning:

The program is intended to solve the problem of determining if, after `n` moves, a tower can have exactly `m` cubes. Each move can either add or remove one cube from the tower.

The key insight to solve this problem is that the number of cubes in the tower after `n` moves can be expressed as:
- Starting with 0 cubes, the tower can have `m` cubes if `m` is reachable by adding or removing cubes in `n` moves.
- Since each move can add or remove exactly one cube, the difference `n - m` must be even. This is because every addition or removal of a cube changes the number of cubes by 1, and to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of additions and removals must balance out to an even difference.

The program reads the number of test cases `kreker` and then iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each. The function `func_1()` reads `n` and `m` from the input, checks if `n - m` is a non-negative even number, and prints 'Yes' if the condition is met, otherwise 'No'.

However, there is a logical error in the condition used in the program. The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is not entirely correct. The correct condition should be:
- `n >= m` (since you can't have more moves than the number of cubes you want to end up with)
- `(n - m) % 2 == 0` (to ensure the difference is even, which means the number of additions and removals can balance out)

The program's condition `n - m >= 0` is correct, but it should also check `n >= m` to ensure the number of moves is sufficient to reach `m` cubes. However, since `n` and `m` are both positive integers and `n - m >= 0` implies `n >= m`, the condition is effectively correct.

Therefore, the program is logically correct and will produce the correct output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
