You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    if (n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should actually be defined with parameters `n` and `m` as described in the problem, so the correct function definition should be `def func_1(n, m):` where `n` and `m` are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    if ((n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0) :
        print('Yes')
        #This is printed: Yes
    else :
        print('No')
        #This is printed: No
    #State: *`n` and `m` are integers provided by the user, with 1 <= n, m <= 100. If `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`, the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number. Otherwise, either `(n - m) % 2 != 0` or `n - m < 0`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two integers `n` and `m` from user input, where both integers are expected to be between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function then checks if the difference `n - m` is a non-negative even number. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that `n` and `m` are the integers provided by the user, and either 'Yes' or 'No' has been printed to the console.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for determining if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Specifically, the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` is incorrect. The correct condition should be `n >= m` because if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, it is always possible to build a tower of `m` cubes by simply adding cubes in `m` moves and then removing or adding cubes in the remaining `n - m` moves to balance out the total number of moves.

For example, consider the test case `n = 2` and `m = 1`. According to the problem description, it is possible to have exactly 1 cube after 2 moves by adding a cube and then removing it. However, the given program would output "No" because `(2 - 1) % 2 == 1` and `2 - 1 >= 0` is true, but the condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` fails. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
