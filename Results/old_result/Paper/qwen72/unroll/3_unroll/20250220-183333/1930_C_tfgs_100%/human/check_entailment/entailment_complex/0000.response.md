### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case using a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Array Update:**
   - The program updates each element `a_i` in the array `a` to `a_i + (i + 1)`. This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Set and Counter Initialization:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the frequency of each updated element in `a`.
   - It then converts `a` to a set to remove duplicates and sorts the set in descending order. This step is correct and ensures that the elements are unique and sorted in the required order.

4. **Gap Filling and Result Construction:**
   - The program initializes `cur` and `cnt` to help manage the gap filling process.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique elements in `a` and appends each element to the result list `ans`.
   - It also fills gaps between consecutive elements by appending the next smallest integers not already in the list, ensuring the length of `ans` is `n`.
   - The `cnt` variable keeps track of the number of elements still needed to fill the gaps, and `cur` helps manage the current count of elements that can be used to fill gaps.

5. **Final Gap Filling:**
   - After processing all unique elements, the program fills any remaining gaps by appending the next smallest integers to `ans`.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the elements of `ans` in a single line separated by spaces, which is the correct format for the output.

### Correctness:
The program correctly follows the steps described in the problem and ensures that the resulting array `b` is lexicographically largest. The use of a `Counter` and the gap-filling logic ensures that all elements are unique and the gaps are filled in the correct order.

**Correctness: True**
