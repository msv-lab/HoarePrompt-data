Let's break down the problem step by step to determine what will be printed by the `print(*ans)` statement.

### Initial State:
1. **`t`**: An integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This is likely the number of test cases, but it doesn't directly affect the `ans` list.
2. **`n`**: An input integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\). This is the length of the `ans` list.
3. **`a`**: A sorted list of unique integers in descending order. Each element `a_i` has been updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`.
4. **`counter`**: A Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` before the update.
5. **`cur`**: An integer initialized to 0.
6. **`cnt`**: An integer initialized to 0.
7. **`ans`**: A list containing all integers from the original list `a` plus additional integers that fill the gaps between the updated values of `a` such that the length of `ans` is `n`.

### Understanding the `ans` List:
- The original list `a` is sorted in descending order.
- Each element `a_i` in the list `a` is updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`.
- The `ans` list is constructed to include all the updated values from `a` and additional integers that fill the gaps between these updated values to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`.

### Steps to Construct `ans`:
1. **Update `a`**: Each element `a_i` in the original list `a` is updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`.
2. **Fill Gaps**: Additional integers are added to `ans` to fill the gaps between the updated values of `a` such that the length of `ans` is `n`.

### Example:
Let's consider an example to illustrate this:
- Suppose the original list `a` is `[5, 3, 1]`.
- After updating, the list `a` becomes:
  - `a[0] = 5 + (0 + 1) = 6`
  - `a[1] = 3 + (1 + 1) = 5`
  - `a[2] = 1 + (2 + 1) = 4`
  - So, the updated list `a` is `[6, 5, 4]`.

- If `n` is 5, we need to fill the gaps to make the length of `ans` 5.
- The gaps between the updated values `[6, 5, 4]` are already filled, so we need to add two more integers. The most straightforward way to fill the gaps is to add the next smallest integers that are not already in the list.
- Therefore, `ans` could be `[6, 5, 4, 3, 2]`.

### General Case:
- The `ans` list will contain the updated values from `a` and additional integers that fill the gaps between these values to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`.
- The additional integers will be the next smallest integers that are not already in the list.

### Output:
The `print(*ans)` statement will print all the elements of the `ans` list, separated by spaces.

Output: **[a_0 + 1, a_1 + 2, a_2 + 3, ..., a_m + (m + 1), additional integers to fill the gaps] (where the additional integers are the next smallest integers not already in the list to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`)**

This description ensures that the output is clear and precise, based on the given initial state and the structure of the problem.
