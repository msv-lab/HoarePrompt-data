### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Array Transformation:**
   - The program updates each element of the array `a` by adding `i + 1` to `a[i]`. This step is correct as it follows the problem description of inserting `a_i + i` into the set `S`.

3. **Set and Counter:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to keep track of the frequency of each element in the updated array `a`.
   - It converts the updated array `a` into a set to remove duplicates and then sorts the set in descending order. This is correct because the set `S` should only contain unique elements, and we need to construct the array `b` in decreasing order.

4. **Gap Filling:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted unique elements and fills gaps between consecutive elements to ensure the length of the resulting array `ans` is `n`.
   - It uses the `counter` to keep track of the remaining elements that need to be added to fill the gaps.
   - The `cur` variable is used to track the number of elements that can be added to fill the gaps, and `cnt` is used to track the remaining elements that need to be added.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program ensures that the length of `ans` is `n` by adding the necessary elements to fill any remaining gaps.
   - It prints the elements of `ans` in the required format.

### Analysis of the Steps:
- **Step 1 and 2:** Correctly handle input and update the array.
- **Step 3:** Correctly converts the array to a set and sorts it in descending order.
- **Step 4:** Correctly fills the gaps between consecutive elements to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`.
- **Step 5:** Correctly prints the final array `ans`.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
- It ensures that the set `S` only contains unique elements.
- It correctly fills gaps to ensure the length of `ans` is `n`.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem description and handles all the necessary steps correctly. It ensures that the resulting array `b` is lexicographically largest by sorting the unique elements in descending order and filling any gaps with the next smallest integers.

Correctness: **True**
