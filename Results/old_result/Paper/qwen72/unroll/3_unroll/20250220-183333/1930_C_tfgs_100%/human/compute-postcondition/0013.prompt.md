Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` remains an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, `a` is a sorted list of unique integers in descending order where each `a_i` has been updated to `a_i + (i + 1)`, `counter` is a Counter object that contains the frequency of each integer in the original list `a` before the update, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, `cur` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `ans` is a list containing all integers from the original list `a` plus additional integers that fill the gaps between the updated values of `a` such that the length of `ans` is `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(cnt):
    ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
