Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Duplicates:**
   - The program uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each element in the modified array `a`. However, the problem specifies that the set `S` can only contain unique elements, and inserting an element that is already present in the set does not change the set. The program does not correctly handle this constraint.

2. **Incorrect Construction of `b`:**
   - The program attempts to construct the array `b` by sorting the unique elements of `a` in descending order and then filling in gaps with the largest possible values. However, this approach does not guarantee the lexicographically largest `b` because it does not consider the optimal order of operations to maximize the values in `b`.

3. **Incorrect Use of `cur` and `cnt`:**
   - The variables `cur` and `cnt` are used to track the number of elements that need to be added to `b`, but the logic for updating these variables is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the fact that the set `S` can only contain unique elements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to ensure that the set `S` only contains unique elements and that you maximize the values in `b` by selecting the optimal index `i` for each operation. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    S = set()
    for i in range(n):
        value = a[i] + i + 1
        while value in S:
            value -= 1
        S.add(value)
    
    b = sorted(S, reverse=True)
    print(*b)
```

### Explanation of the Correct Approach:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize an empty set `S`.

2. **Operations:**
   - For each element in the array `a`, compute the value `a[i] + i + 1`.
   - Check if this value is already in the set `S`. If it is, decrement the value until it is unique and then add it to the set.

3. **Constructing `b`:**
   - After all operations, convert the set `S` to a sorted list in descending order to form the array `b`.

4. **Output:**
   - Print the elements of `b`.

This approach ensures that the set `S` only contains unique elements and that the array `b` is constructed to be lexicographically largest.
