The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. The loop will execute `t` times, so for the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`func` is defined with parameters `a` and `b` as lists of integers, and `n` as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and both `a` and `b` are of length `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order, `t` must be greater than 0**
