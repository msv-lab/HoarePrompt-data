Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read `n`, `a`, and `b` from the input. After processing, it will print the count of elements in `b` that are less than the first element in `a`. The variables `cnt` and `i` will be reset to 0 for each iteration of the loop. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will remain unchanged after each iteration, but they will be overwritten in the next iteration.**
