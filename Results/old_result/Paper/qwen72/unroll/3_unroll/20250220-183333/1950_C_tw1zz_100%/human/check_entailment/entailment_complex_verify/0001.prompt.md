You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

    #State: The loop will print the time in 12-hour format with AM/PM for each input time string, and the variables `t` and `s` will remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It reads an integer `t` from the input, which specifies the number of time strings to process. For each of the `t` time strings in the format "hh:mm", it converts the time to a 12-hour format with AM/PM and prints the converted time. The function does not modify any external variables or state.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case, reading the time in 24-hour format.

2. **Time Conversion**:
   - The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the hour part of the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
   - For hours from 01 to 11, it correctly sets the hour part to the same value and the time part to 'AM'.
   - For hour 12, it correctly sets the hour part to 12 and the time part to 'PM'.
   - For hours from 13 to 23, it correctly subtracts 12 from the hour and sets the time part to 'PM'.
   - For hour 00, it correctly sets the hour part to 12 and the time part to 'AM'.

3. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program constructs the output string in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" by concatenating the hour, minute, and time part.
   - It uses `sep=''` in the `print` function to ensure there are no extra spaces between the components of the output string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the transition from 12:00 AM to 12:00 PM and vice versa.
   - It also correctly handles leading zeros in the hour and minute parts.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - While the use of multiple `if-elif` statements is not the most efficient way to handle the conversion, it is correct for the given problem size (up to 1440 test cases).

Given the above points, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
