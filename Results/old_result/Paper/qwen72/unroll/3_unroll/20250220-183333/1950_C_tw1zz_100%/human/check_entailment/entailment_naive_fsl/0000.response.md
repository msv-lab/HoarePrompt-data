Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the hour is `12` correctly for the `AM` period. According to the problem description, `12:00` in the 24-hour format should be `12:00 AM` in the 12-hour format, but the program does not have a specific condition to handle `12` for `AM`. It only sets `12` to `PM` when the hour is `12`. Therefore, the program will incorrectly output `12:00 PM` for `12:00` in the 24-hour format.
