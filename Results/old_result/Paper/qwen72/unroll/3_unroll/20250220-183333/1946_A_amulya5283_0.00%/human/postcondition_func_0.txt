The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. Each test case is a tuple `(n, a)`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of `n` integers. It returns a list `results` of length `t`, where each element in `results` represents the number of operations required to make the smallest element in the sorted array of each test case greater than the median of that array. The input variables `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution.
