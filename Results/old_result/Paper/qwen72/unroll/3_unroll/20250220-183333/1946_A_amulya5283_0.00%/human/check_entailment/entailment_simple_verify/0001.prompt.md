You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers.

The median of an array q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_k is the number p_{\lceil
\frac{k}{2} \rceil} , where p is the array q sorted in non-decreasing order.
For example, the median of the array [9, 5, 1, 2, 6] is 5 , as in the sorted
array [1, 2, 5, 6, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 is 5
, and the median of the array [9, 2, 8, 3] is 3 , as in the sorted array [2,
3, 8, 9] , the number at index \lceil \frac{4}{2} \rceil = 2 is 3 .

You are allowed to choose an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) and increase a_i by 1
in one operation.

Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the
median of the array.

Note that the array a may not necessarily contain distinct numbers.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^5
) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations
required to increase the median of the array.

Note

In the first test case, you can apply one operation to the first number and
obtain the array [3, 2, 8] , the median of this array is 3 , as it is the
number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 3, 8] . The median of the original array [2, 2, 8] is 2 , as it is
the number at index \lceil \frac{3}{2} \rceil = 2 in the non-decreasing sorted
array [2, 2, 8] . Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in just one operation.

In the fourth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 2, 3 and obtain the array [6, 6, 6, 4, 5] , the median of this
array is 6 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 6, 6, 6] . The median of the original array
[5, 5, 5, 4, 5] is 5 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{5}{2} \rceil
= 2 in the non-decreasing sorted array [4, 5, 5, 5, 5] . Thus, the median
increased (6 > 5 ) in three operations. It can be shown that this is the
minimum possible number of operations.

In the fifth test case, you can apply one operation to each of the numbers at
indices 1, 3 and obtain the array [3, 1, 3, 3, 1, 4] , the median of this
array is 3 , as it is the number at index \lceil \frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the
non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 4] . The median of the original
array [2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] is 2 , as it is the number at index \lceil
\frac{6}{2} \rceil = 3 in the non-decreasing sorted array [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4] .
Thus, the median increased (3 > 2 ) in two operations. It can be shown that
this is the minimum possible number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes each test case by extracting the length `n` and the array `arr` from the list.
   - This approach is efficient for reading large inputs, which is important given the constraints (up to 10^4 test cases and each array can have up to 10^5 elements).

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - For each test case, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Sorting is necessary to determine the median, which is the middle element for odd-length arrays and the element at the higher middle index for even-length arrays.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median index is calculated as `n // 2`. This is correct because for an array of length `n`, the median is the element at index `n // 2` in the sorted array.
   - For even-length arrays, the median is the element at index `n // 2`, which is the higher middle index.

4. **Heap Initialization:**
   - A min-heap is initialized with the elements from the median index to the end of the array. This is done to efficiently manage the smallest elements that need to be incremented to increase the median.
   - The heap is used to keep track of the smallest elements that are greater than or equal to the current median.

5. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program uses a while loop to increment the smallest element in the heap until it is greater than the current median.
   - Each time an element is incremented, the number of operations is increased by 1.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to increase the median.

6. **Result Collection:**
   - The number of operations required for each test case is collected in the `results` list.
   - Finally, the results are printed for each test case.

### Correctness:

- **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a loop and storing each test case in a list.

- **Median Calculation:**
  - The median calculation is correct for both odd and even-length arrays.

- **Heap Operations:**
  - The use of a min-heap to increment the smallest elements is efficient and ensures the minimum number of operations.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly outputs the number of operations required for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
