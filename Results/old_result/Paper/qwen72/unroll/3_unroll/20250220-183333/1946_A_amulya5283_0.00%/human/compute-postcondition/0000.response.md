Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and test_cases is a list of test cases where each test case is a tuple (n, a) with n being a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and a being a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. `results` is an empty list.**
