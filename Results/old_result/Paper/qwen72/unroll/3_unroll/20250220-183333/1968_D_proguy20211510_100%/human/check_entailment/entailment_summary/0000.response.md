Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input for each test case, converting the necessary values to integers and splitting the lines appropriately. This ensures that the input is handled correctly and efficiently.

2. **Cycle Detection**: The function correctly identifies the path each player will take by following the permutation `p` from their starting positions `P_B` and `P_S`. It uses a `vis` list to mark visited positions and stops when it encounters a position that has already been visited, effectively detecting cycles in the permutation.

3. **Score Calculation**: The function calculates the score for each player by iterating through the path and summing the values from array `a` for each turn. It uses a `preb` and `pres` variable to keep track of the cumulative score and a `resb` and `ress` variable to store the maximum possible score for each player.

4. **Optimization for Large `k`**: The function optimizes the score calculation for large values of `k` by breaking out of the loop if `k` is less than the current turn index `i + 1`. This ensures that the function does not perform unnecessary calculations and handles large `k` values efficiently.

5. **Comparison and Output**: The function compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') based on the comparison. This is done correctly and ensures that the output matches the problem requirements.

6. **Global Variables**: The global variables `YES`, `NO`, `MOD`, and `alpha` are not used in the function, but they do not affect the correctness of the function. They can be safely ignored.

7. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when `k` is very large or when the starting positions are part of a cycle in the permutation. It correctly calculates the scores and determines the winner in these scenarios.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It processes the input, detects cycles, calculates scores, and outputs the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
