Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in the way it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. The issue lies in the calculation of the score for each player. The program attempts to calculate the maximum possible score for each player by considering the score contributions from each position in the cycle, but it does not correctly account for the number of turns each player can stay at a position or move to the next position in the cycle.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Cycle Detection and Path Calculation**:
   - The program correctly identifies the cycle for each player's starting position and calculates the path they would follow.
   - However, the way it calculates the score is incorrect. It uses a formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` which is not appropriate for this problem. This formula assumes that the player can stay at a position for `(k - i)` turns, which is not how the game is played. The player can either stay at the current position or move to the next position in the permutation, and this decision is made on each turn.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The correct approach should be to simulate the game for `k` turns, keeping track of the current position and score for each player. For each turn, the player's score should increase by the value at the current position, and then the player should decide whether to stay or move to the next position based on the permutation.
   - The program does not correctly simulate the game for `k` turns. Instead, it tries to calculate the score in a way that does not match the game rules.

3. **Cycle Handling**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the number of turns `k` is greater than the length of the cycle. In such cases, the player will repeat the cycle multiple times, and the score should be calculated accordingly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should:
1. Identify the cycle for each player's starting position.
2. Simulate the game for `k` turns, keeping track of the current position and score for each player.
3. For each turn, update the score and move to the next position in the cycle.
4. Compare the final scores after `k` turns to determine the winner.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        def simulate_game(start, k):
            score = 0
            position = start
            visited = [0] * n
            path = []
            
            while not visited[position - 1]:
                visited[position - 1] = 1
                path.append(a[position - 1])
                position = p[position - 1]
            
            cycle_start = position
            cycle_length = 0
            cycle_score = 0
            
            while True:
                cycle_score += a[position - 1]
                cycle_length += 1
                position = p[position - 1]
                if position == cycle_start:
                    break
            
            non_cycle_score = sum(path[:path.index(a[cycle_start - 1])])
            non_cycle_length = len(path) - cycle_length
            
            full_cycles = (k - non_cycle_length) // cycle_length
            remaining_turns = (k - non_cycle_length) % cycle_length
            
            score = non_cycle_score + full_cycles * cycle_score
            for _ in range(remaining_turns):
                score += a[position - 1]
                position = p[position - 1]
            
            return score
        
        bodya_score = simulate_game(pb, k)
        sasha_score = simulate_game(ps, k)
        
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

func()
```

This corrected version correctly simulates the game for `k` turns and handles cycles appropriately.
