Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` are integers such that (1 ≤ P_B, P_S ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) and (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), `p` is a permutation of length n, `a` is an array of length n, where each element a_i is a positive integer (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. `YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO'. `MOD` is 1000000007. `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.**
