### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func()` starts by defining a large constant `MOD = 10 ** 9 + 6`, which is not used in the problem description and is unnecessary. This can be removed.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Array and String Reading:**
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It reads the array `arr` of `n` integers.
   - It reads the string `s` of `n` characters, each being either 'L' or 'R'.

3. **Initial Product Calculation:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to 1.
   - The product of all elements in `arr` is calculated and stored in `ans`.
   - The first element of the result list `res` is set to `ans % m`.

4. **Processing Commands:**
   - The function uses two pointers `l` and `r` to keep track of the left and right indices of the array `arr`.
   - For each command in `s` (except the first one), it updates `ans` by dividing it by the element at the current left or right index, depending on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - It then calculates the remainder of `ans` modulo `m` and stores it in the result list `res`.
   - The pointers `l` and `r` are updated accordingly to reflect the removal of the element.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all commands, the function prints the result list `res` for the current test case.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary `MOD` Constant:**
  - The `MOD` constant is used in the calculations, but it is not required by the problem description. The problem only asks for the remainder modulo `m`.
  - The line `res[0] = ans % m % MOD` and `res[c] = ans % m % MOD` should be simplified to `res[0] = ans % m` and `res[c] = ans % m` respectively.

- **Division and Modulo Operation:**
  - The division operation `ans // arr[l]` and `ans // arr[r]` can lead to incorrect results if `ans` is not exactly divisible by `arr[l]` or `arr[r]`. This can happen if the product of the remaining elements is not an integer multiple of the removed element.
  - To handle this correctly, you should use the modular multiplicative inverse to divide in modular arithmetic. However, this is not necessary if you are sure that the product will always be divisible, which is the case here since the product is initially calculated from all elements.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        s = list(input())
        
        res = [0] * n
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in arr:
            ans *= i
            ans %= m  # Ensure ans does not overflow
        
        res[0] = ans
        
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = ans * pow(arr[l], -1, m) % m  # Use modular inverse
                res[k + 1] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = ans * pow(arr[r], -1, m) % m  # Use modular inverse
                res[k + 1] = ans
                r -= 1
        
        print(*res)
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as described above.
- **False** if the program remains as it is, because the use of `MOD` and the division operation can lead to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the unnecessary `MOD` constant and potential division issues). However, if the program is corrected as described, it would be **True**.
