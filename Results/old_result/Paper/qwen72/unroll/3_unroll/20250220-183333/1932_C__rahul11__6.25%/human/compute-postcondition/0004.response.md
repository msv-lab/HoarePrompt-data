Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers `arr`, and a string `s` of `n` characters (each being 'L' or 'R'). It calculates a list `res` of `n` integers where `res[0]` is the product of all elements in `arr` modulo `m` and then modulo `10^9 + 6`. For subsequent elements in `res`, it updates the product by dividing it by the current element from the left or right of `arr` based on the corresponding character in `s`, and then takes the result modulo `m` and `10^9 + 6`. After processing each test case, it prints the list `res`. The function does not return any value, and the variables `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `MOD` remain unchanged across test cases. **
