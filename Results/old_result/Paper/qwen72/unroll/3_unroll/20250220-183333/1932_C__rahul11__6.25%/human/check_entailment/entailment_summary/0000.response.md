### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` correctly initializes the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `arr`, and the command string `s`.

2. **Product Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the initial product of all elements in `arr` and stores it in `ans`.
   - It then takes the product modulo `m` and further modulo `10^9 + 6` to store the result in `res[0]`.

3. **Command Processing**:
   - The function iterates through the command string `s` and updates the product `ans` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R'.
   - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element of `arr` and updates the product.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element of `arr` and updates the product.
   - It then takes the updated product modulo `m` and further modulo `10^9 + 6` to store the result in the corresponding position in `res`.

4. **Output**:
   - After processing all commands for a test case, the function prints the list `res`.

### Issues:
- **Unnecessary Modulo `10^9 + 6`**:
  - The problem description does not require taking the product modulo `10^9 + 6`. The only modulo operation needed is by `m`.
  - The variable `MOD` is set to `10^9 + 6` and is used unnecessarily in the calculations. This can lead to incorrect results if the product modulo `m` is greater than `10^9 + 6`.

- **Division in Modular Arithmetic**:
  - The function uses integer division (`//`) to update the product `ans`. However, in modular arithmetic, division is not straightforward and should be handled using the modular multiplicative inverse.
  - For example, if `ans` is the product modulo `m`, and you need to "divide" by `arr[l]`, you should multiply `ans` by the modular multiplicative inverse of `arr[l]` modulo `m`.

### Correctness:
- **False**:
  - The program is incorrect because it uses unnecessary modulo operations and incorrect division in modular arithmetic. These issues can lead to incorrect results for the product modulo `m`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program that addresses the issues:

```python
def modular_inverse(a, m):
    # Using Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse
    def egcd(a, b):
        if a == 0:
            return (b, 0, 1)
        else:
            (g, y, x) = egcd(b % a, a)
            return (g, x - (b // a) * y, y)
    
    (g, x, y) = egcd(a, m)
    if g != 1:
        raise Exception('modular inverse does not exist')
    else:
        return x % m

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * modular_inverse(arr[l], m)) % m
                res[k + 1] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * modular_inverse(arr[r], m)) % m
                res[k + 1] = ans
                r -= 1
        print(*res)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Modular Inverse**:
  - The `modular_inverse` function calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `a` modulo `m` using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
- **Product Calculation**:
  - The initial product is calculated and taken modulo `m` directly.
- **Command Processing**:
  - For each command, the product is updated by multiplying with the modular inverse of the removed element, and then taking the result modulo `m`.

### Final Correctness:
- **True**:
  - The corrected program correctly processes the commands and outputs the required results based on the problem description.
