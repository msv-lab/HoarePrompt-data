### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing (func_2):**
   - The function `func_2` reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly parses the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - It appends these values as a tuple to the `test_cases` list.
   - This part of the code is correct and follows the input format specified in the problem description.

2. **Processing Test Cases (func_1):**
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case in the `test_cases` list.
   - It initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a counter `count` to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`:
     - It calculates `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`.
     - The calculation of `rx` is correct because it ensures that the result is always non-negative and within the range `[0, x-1]`.
     - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - The logic for determining if a pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful is correct. The conditions `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` are checked using the modulo operations.
   - The use of a frequency dictionary to count pairs is efficient and correct. It ensures that each pair is counted only once and handles the constraints of the problem.

3. **Output (func_2):**
   - After processing all test cases using `func_1`, it prints each result in the `results` list.
   - The output is correctly formatted as required by the problem.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:
- The annotations confirm that the state of the program is correctly managed throughout the execution of both functions.
- The `freq` dictionary is used to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`, and the `count` is updated correctly based on the presence of these pairs in the dictionary.
- The final `results` list contains the counts for each test case, and these counts are printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
Both functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and handle the problem as described. The logic and input/output handling are appropriate for the given constraints and test cases.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
