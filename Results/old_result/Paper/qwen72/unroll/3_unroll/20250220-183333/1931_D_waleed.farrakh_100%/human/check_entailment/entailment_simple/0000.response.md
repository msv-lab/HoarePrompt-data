### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`**:
   - The function reads the input from standard input and splits it into lines.
   - It correctly parses the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it parses `n`, `x`, and `y` from the next line and the array `arr` from the line after that.
   - It constructs a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - The state of the program after this function call is correct, with `test_cases` containing the expected tuples.

2. **Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case.
   - It initializes an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It also initializes a variable `count` to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array `arr`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x`, which ensures that `rx` is always non-negative and represents the remainder when `-a` is divided by `x`.
     - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`, which represents the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to `count`.
   - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - After processing all elements in `arr`, it appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - The final `results` list contains the correct counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

3. **Output in `func_2`**:
   - After calling `func_1`, the function iterates over the `results` list and prints each result to the console.
   - The output state is correct, as it prints the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly processes the input, calculates the number of beautiful pairs for each test case, and outputs the results as expected. The logic and implementation are sound and match the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
