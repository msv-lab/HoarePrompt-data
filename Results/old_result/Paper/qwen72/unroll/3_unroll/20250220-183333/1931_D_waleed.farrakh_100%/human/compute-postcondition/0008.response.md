Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, where each tuple is `(n, x, y, arr)`. Each `n` is an integer representing the size of the array, `x` and `y` are Polycarp's favorite integers, and `arr` is a list of integers representing the elements of the array. The variable `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`. The variable `results` is the output of the function `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as its argument.**
