To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `result` and `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is a non-empty iterable. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **`results` must be a non-empty iterable**: For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `results`.

2. **`result` is the first element in `results`**: At the start of the loop, `result` will be set to the first element of `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` remains unchanged.
- `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples.
- `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`.
- `results` is the output of the function `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as its argument.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `results` is non-empty. The initial state does not provide information about the content of `results`, so we need to assume that `func_1` returns a non-empty list.

State: **`t` remains unchanged, `test_cases` is a list containing `t` tuples, `idx` is `1 + 2 * t`, `results` is a non-empty list (output of `func_1`), `result` is the first element in `results`**
