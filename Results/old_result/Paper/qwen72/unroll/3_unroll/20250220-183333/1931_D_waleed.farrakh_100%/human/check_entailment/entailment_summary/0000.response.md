### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling in `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads the input from standard input and processes it to construct a list of test cases. Each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - The input is split into lines, and the first line is used to determine the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, the function reads the next two lines to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, and appends the tuple to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing in `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes the list of test cases and processes each one to find the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - It iterates over the array `arr` and for each element `a`, it calculates `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx` is `(-a % x + x) % x`, which is the negative remainder of `a` when divided by `x`, adjusted to be non-negative.
     - `ry` is `a % y`, which is the remainder of `a` when divided by `y`.
   - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` is already in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it adds the frequency of this pair to the count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the `freq` dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.

3. **Output in `func_2`:**
   - After processing all test cases with `func_1`, `func_2` prints each result to the console.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling:**
  - `func_2` correctly reads the input and constructs the test cases as expected.
  - The input is processed line by line, and the test cases are appended to the list `test_cases`.

- **Pair Calculation:**
  - `func_1` correctly calculates the pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and `(rx, ry)`.
  - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative, which is necessary for the correct implementation of the problem.
  - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions, and this is done correctly.

- **Output:**
  - `func_2` prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The input handling, pair calculation, and output generation are all done correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
