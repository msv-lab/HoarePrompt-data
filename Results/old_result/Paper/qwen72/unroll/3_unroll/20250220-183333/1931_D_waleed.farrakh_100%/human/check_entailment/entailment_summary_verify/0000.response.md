### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes it into a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.
   - It correctly parses the input and constructs the test cases as required by the problem description.
   - The variable `idx` is used to keep track of the current line being processed, and it is incremented by 2 for each test case, which is correct because each test case consists of two lines: one for `(n, x, y)` and one for `arr`.

2. **Logic for Counting Beautiful Pairs (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of test cases and processes each one to count the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the remainders of the elements when divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` for each element `a`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` ensures that the remainder is positive and represents the condition for \(a_i + a_j\) being divisible by `x`.
     - `ry = a % y` represents the condition for \(a_i - a_j\) being divisible by `y`.
   - It checks if the key `(rx, ry)` is already in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it adds the count of that key to the total count of beautiful pairs.
   - It then updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
   - Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the results list.

3. **Validation of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound. By using the remainders, it efficiently groups elements that can form beautiful pairs.
   - The key `(rx, ry)` ensures that both conditions for a beautiful pair are checked simultaneously.
   - The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count pairs without needing to compare each pair explicitly, which is efficient and avoids a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

4. **Output Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - After processing all test cases, `func_2` prints the results to the console, one result per test case.
   - This matches the required output format as specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs for each test case and handles the input and output format as specified.
- The logic in `func_1` is efficient and correct, and `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

Final: **True**
