Output State: The variable `t` remains unchanged. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged. The variable `idx` remains unchanged. The variable `results` is the same as the output of the function `func_1` when called with `test_cases` as its argument. The loop has printed each element of `results` to the console, one by one.
