### Reasoning:

#### Function 1 Analysis:
1. **State Before Function Call:**
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - Each `n` is an integer such that \(2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - Each `x` and `y` are integers such that \(1 \le x, y \le 10^9\).
   - Each `arr` is a list of integers of length `n` such that \(1 \le arr[i] \le 10^9\).

2. **Function Logic:**
   - Initialize an empty list `results` to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - For each test case `(n, x, y, arr)`, initialize an empty dictionary `freq` to keep track of the frequency of pairs \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
   - Initialize `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.
   - Iterate over each element `a` in `arr`:
     - Compute `rx` as \((-a \% x + x) \% x\). This ensures that `rx` is the positive remainder when \(-a\) is divided by `x`.
     - Compute `ry` as \(a \% y\).
     - If the pair \((rx, ry)\) is already in `freq`, increment `count` by the frequency of \((rx, ry)\).
     - Update the frequency dictionary `freq` with the current pair \((a \% x, a \% y)\).
   - Append `count` to `results`.
   - Return `results`.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The computation of `rx` and `ry` is crucial for identifying beautiful pairs.
   - The use of a frequency dictionary `freq` ensures efficient counting of pairs.
   - The conditions for a beautiful pair are:
     - \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by `x`.
     - \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by `y`.

4. **Validation:**
   - The computation of `rx` as \((-a \% x + x) \% x\) ensures that `rx` is the positive remainder when \(-a\) is divided by `x`. This is correct because:
     - \((-a \% x + x) \% x\) ensures that the remainder is always positive.
     - For a pair \((i, j)\) to be beautiful, \(a_i + a_j\) must be divisible by `x`, which means \((a_i \% x + a_j \% x) \% x == 0\). Since `rx` is \((-a \% x + x) \% x`, it correctly represents the remainder needed for the sum condition.
   - The computation of `ry` as \(a \% y\) is straightforward and correct.
   - The dictionary `freq` is used to count the number of times a pair \((a \% x, a \% y)\) has been seen before. This is correct because it allows us to efficiently count pairs that meet the conditions.
   - The final `results` list is correctly constructed and returned.

#### Function 2 Analysis:
1. **State Before Function Call:**
   - No variables are passed to `func_2()`.
   - The function reads input from standard input.

2. **Function Logic:**
   - Read all input lines into a list `data`.
   - Parse the first line to get the number of test cases `t`.
   - Initialize an empty list `test_cases` to store the parsed test cases.
   - For each test case, parse the next two lines to get `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
   - Append the parsed test case to `test_cases`.
   - Call `func_1` with `test_cases` and store the results in `results`.
   - Print each result in `results`.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The input is read and parsed correctly.
   - The test cases are constructed correctly and passed to `func_1`.
   - The results from `func_1` are printed correctly.

4. **Validation:**
   - The input is read and split into lines correctly.
   - The number of test cases `t` is parsed correctly.
   - Each test case is parsed and constructed correctly.
   - The results from `func_1` are printed correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies and counts the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. The logic in `func_1` is sound and the input/output handling in `func_2` is correct. No issues were found in the reasoning or the implementation.

**Final: True**
