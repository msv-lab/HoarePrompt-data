You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n % 2:
            if 2 * a < b:
                print(a * n)
            else:
                print(n // 2 * b + a)
        elif 2 * a < b:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(n // 2 * b)
        
    #State: The values of t, n, a, and b remain unchanged, but the loop has printed the calculated values for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (where 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= a, b <= 30). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the following conditions: if `n` is odd and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is odd and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b + a`; if `n` is even and `2 * a` is less than `b`, it prints `a * n`; if `n` is even and `2 * a` is not less than `b`, it prints `n // 2 * b`. The function does not return any value, but it prints the calculated results for each test case. The input variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not modified by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

**Explanation:**

The program does not handle the case where the promotion price `b` is less than the regular price for two yogurts `2 * a`, but the number of yogurts `n` is odd. In such a scenario, the program might not always provide the minimum cost.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
3 5 8
```
Here, `n = 3`, `a = 5`, and `b = 8`.

- The regular price for 3 yogurts is `3 * 5 = 15` burles.
- The promotion price for 2 yogurts is `8` burles, and the regular price for 1 yogurt is `5` burles, so the total cost is `8 + 5 = 13` burles.

The correct minimum cost should be `13` burles, but the program will output `15` burles, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the logic where the program checks `if 2 * a < b` and then prints `a * n` for odd `n`. This does not consider the possibility that using the promotion price for as many pairs as possible and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price might be cheaper.
