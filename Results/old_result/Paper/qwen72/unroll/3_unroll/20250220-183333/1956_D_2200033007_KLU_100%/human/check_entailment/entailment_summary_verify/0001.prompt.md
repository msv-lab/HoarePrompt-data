You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `make_stairs` accepts a non-negative integer `i` and modifies the list `arr` and the list of tuples `res`. If the elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` form a sequence of integers from 0 to `i`, the function returns `None` without making any changes. Otherwise, it ensures that all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + i` are set to `i`, and appends the tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` to `res`. The function does not return any value explicitly, but the final state of the program is that `arr` is modified to form a "staircase" pattern, and `res` contains tuples representing the ranges of indices that were modified.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than \(5 \cdot 10^5\) times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the set.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to compute the maximum possible sum of the subarray from `start_index` to `end_index` after applying the operation.
   - It uses dynamic programming to store results in a dictionary `res_dict` to avoid redundant calculations.
   - The base case is when `start_index` equals `end_index`, in which case the maximum sum is the maximum of 1 and the element at that index.
   - The function then tries to split the subarray at different points and computes the maximum sum by considering the MEX of the subarrays.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(start_index, end_index)`**:
   - This function is intended to construct the sequence of operations that achieves the maximum sum computed by `func_1`.
   - It recursively checks different splits and compares the results to determine the optimal sequence of operations.
   - If the length of the subarray is 1, it checks if the element is 0 and returns the appropriate operation.
   - If the maximum value is equal to the square of the length of the subarray, it calls `make_stairs` and returns the operation.
   - Otherwise, it recursively constructs the operations for the subarrays.

4. **Function 3: `make_stairs(i)`**:
   - This function is intended to transform a subarray into a "staircase" of MEX values.
   - It checks if the subarray is already in the desired form (a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0).
   - If not, it recursively transforms the subarray and updates the elements to the MEX value.
   - It appends the operation to the result list `res` and updates the array `arr`.

5. **Issues and Concerns**:
   - **MEX Calculation**: The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the MEX of the subarray. It uses a heuristic that does not match the definition of MEX.
   - **Recursion and Splitting**: The recursion in `func_2` and `make_stairs` is not well-defined. The function `make_stairs` is called with a fixed `start_index` which is not updated in the recursive calls.
   - **Global Variables**: The functions `func_2` and `make_stairs` rely on global variables `res` and `arr`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and make the code hard to understand and maintain.
   - **Operation Count**: The program does not ensure that the number of operations is within the limit of \(5 \cdot 10^5\).

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The MEX calculation is incorrect, and the recursive functions do not handle the subarray transformations properly. Additionally, the use of global variables and the lack of a clear operation count mechanism are significant issues.

Correctness: **False**
