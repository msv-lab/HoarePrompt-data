To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `start_index`, and `i`.

1. **`j`**: This is the loop variable, and it will be initialized by the `range` function.
2. **`start_index`**: This is a non-negative integer and is used as the starting point of the range.
3. **`i`**: This is a non-negative integer and is used to define the end point of the range.

The loop `for j in range(start_index, start_index + i + 1)` will execute if the range it defines is non-empty. For the range to be non-empty, the condition `start_index + i + 1` must be greater than `start_index`. This simplifies to `i + 1` being greater than 0, which is always true since `i` is a non-negative integer. However, since `i` is now `i - 1`, we need to ensure that `i - 1` is still non-negative to avoid the range being empty.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `i` is a non-negative integer.
- `start_index` is a non-negative integer.
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `res` is a list of tuples with one additional tuple `(start_index, start_index + i)` appended.
- `is_already_stairs` is False.
- `i` is now `i - 1`.
- `arr[start_index + i]` is not equal to `i`.

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i - 1` is non-negative, and `j` is initialized correctly.

State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `j` is initialized to `start_index`**
