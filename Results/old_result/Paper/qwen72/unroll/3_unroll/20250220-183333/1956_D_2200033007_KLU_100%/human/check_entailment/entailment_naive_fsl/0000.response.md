Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and the operations to maximize the sum of the array. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to maximize a value that is not the sum of the array but rather a different metric. Additionally, the function `make_stairs` attempts to create a sequence of numbers from 0 to `i`, but it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray and apply the operation as described in the problem statement. 

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the program's logic in `func_1` and `make_stairs` does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the array by setting the subarray to the MEX value. The program might return an incorrect sequence of operations or an incorrect maximum sum.
