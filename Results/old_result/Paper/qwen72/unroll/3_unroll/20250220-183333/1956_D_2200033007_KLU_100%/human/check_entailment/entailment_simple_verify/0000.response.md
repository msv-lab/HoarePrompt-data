Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the MEX calculation and the operations to maximize the sum of the array as required by the problem statement. Let's break down the issues:

### Issues in `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Metric Calculation**:
   - `func_1` is designed to maximize a value that is not the sum of the array but rather a different metric. Specifically, it calculates a value based on the square of the length of the subarray and the values of the array elements, which does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the array by setting the subarray to the MEX value.
   - The function `func_1` is not correctly computing the MEX of the subarray and is instead using a heuristic that does not match the problem's constraints.

### Issues in `make_stairs`:
1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation**:
   - The function `make_stairs` attempts to create a sequence of numbers from 0 to `i`, but it does not correctly compute the MEX of the subarray. The MEX is defined as the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subarray, but `make_stairs` is simply setting the subarray to a specific value without considering the MEX.
   - The function `make_stairs` is not designed to handle the MEX calculation and the operations to maximize the sum of the array.

### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
4
1 100 2 1
```
The expected output is:
```
105 2
3 3
3 4
```
However, the program's logic in `func_1` and `make_stairs` does not align with the problem's requirement to maximize the sum of the array by setting the subarray to the MEX value. The program might return an incorrect sequence of operations or an incorrect maximum sum.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, the program should:
1. **Calculate the MEX of the subarray**.
2. **Set the subarray to the MEX value**.
3. **Recursively apply the operation to maximize the sum**.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to maximize the sum of the array by setting the subarray to the MEX value. The functions `func_1` and `make_stairs` are not aligned with the problem's requirements.

Final: **False**
