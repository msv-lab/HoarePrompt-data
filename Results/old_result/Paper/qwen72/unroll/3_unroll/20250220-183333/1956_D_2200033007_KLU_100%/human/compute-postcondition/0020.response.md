Postcondition: ***`i` is a non-negative integer, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, and `is_already_stairs` is False. If `arr[start_index + i]` is equal to `i`, then `i` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, all elements in `arr` from index `start_index` to `start_index + (i - 1)` (inclusive) are set to `i - 1`, and a tuple `(start_index, start_index + (i - 1))` is appended to `res`, with `i` also decreased by 1.***
