The only objects in the loop head are variables `j` and `i`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is at least 0, the loop can execute because `range(i + 1)` will include at least one value (0). Before the loop starts, `i` is a non-negative integer, which means `i` is already set to a value that ensures the loop will execute. However, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial condition of the loop.

State: **`i` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `start_index` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `res` is a list of tuples, `is_already_stairs` is True**
