The function `func_1` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided code snippet. However, based on the parameter constraints and the output description, we can infer that the function likely accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of integers. The function returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the entire `a` list, which is stored in `dp[0][0]` after the `dp` table has been filled from the bottom up.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice. It returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the list `a`.**
