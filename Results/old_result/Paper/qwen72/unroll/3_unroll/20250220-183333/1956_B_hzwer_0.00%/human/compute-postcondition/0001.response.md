The code `cards = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings based on spaces, converts each string to an integer, and stores the resulting list of integers in the variable `cards`.

- `n` is an input integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.
- After executing the code, `cards` will be a list of integers read from the input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list, `cards` is a list of integers read from the input.**
