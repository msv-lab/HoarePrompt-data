t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, representing the number of cards each player receives. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n, representing the integers on the cards in your hand. Each integer from 1 to n appears in the sequence a at most 2 times. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
