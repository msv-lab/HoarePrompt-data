To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and conditions in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):`.

1. **Variable `i`**: This variable will be adjusted by the loop itself, starting from `n - 3` and decrementing by 1 until it reaches -1 (exclusive). Therefore, `i` does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

2. **Variable `n`**: The loop will execute if `n - 3` is greater than or equal to 0. This means `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to run at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.
- `cards` is a list of integers read from the input.
- `dp` is a 2D list of size (n+1) x (n+1) initialized with zeros.
- `dp[n - 1][0]` is 0.
- `dp[n - 2][0]` is 0.

We need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 for the loop to execute. The other variables and conditions do not need to be adjusted because they are not part of the loop head.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is `n - 3`**
