You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), and a is a list of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) where each integer from 1 to n appears at most twice in the list.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [([0] * (n + 1)) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
        
    #State: The `dp` table is filled from the bottom up, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of pairs that can be formed starting from index `i` in the `cards` list, with the last card used being `j+1`. The final state of `dp` will reflect the optimal solutions for all subproblems, and the value of `dp[0][0]` will be the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the entire `cards` list. The values of `n`, `a`, and `cards` remain unchanged.
    return dp[0][0]
    #The program returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the entire `cards` list, which is stored in `dp[0][0] after the `dp` table has been filled from the bottom up.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice. It returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the list `a`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the entire `cards` list, which is stored in `dp[0][0] after the `dp` table has been filled from the bottom up.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
