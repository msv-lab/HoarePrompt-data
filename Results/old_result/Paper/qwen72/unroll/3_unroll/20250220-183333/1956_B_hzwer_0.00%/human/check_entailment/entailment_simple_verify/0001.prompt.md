You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We have a deck of 2n cards, each card has an integer from 1 to n.
   - Each integer appears exactly twice.
   - The cards are distributed equally between you and Nene.
   - The game proceeds with 2n turns, n turns each.
   - You and Nene take turns placing one card on the table.
   - If a player places a card with a number that is already on the table, they score a point.
   - Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The program uses a dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points you can score starting from the i-th turn with j cards on the table.
   - The DP table is initialized with `dp[n-1][0] = 0` and `dp[n-2][0] = 0` to handle the base cases where no cards are on the table and it's the last or second-to-last turn.
   - The program iterates backward through the turns and updates the DP table based on the number of times each card appears in your hand.

3. **DP Table Update**:
   - If a card `j+1` is not in your hand (`cards.count(j + 1) == 0`), the score remains the same as the next turn.
   - If a card `j+1` appears once in your hand (`cards.count(j + 1) == 1`), you have two options:
     - Skip this card and move to the next turn (`dp[i + 1][j]`).
     - Play this card and score a point if it's already on the table (`dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`).
   - If a card `j+1` appears twice in your hand (`cards.count(j + 1) == 2`), you have three options:
     - Skip this card and move to the next turn (`dp[i + 1][j]`).
     - Play this card and score a point if it's already on the table (`dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1`).
     - Play this card and leave one on the table for Nene (`dp[i + 1][j + 1]`).

4. **Optimal Play**:
   - The program assumes that Nene will always play optimally, which means she will always choose the card that maximizes her score and minimizes yours.
   - The DP table is updated to reflect the best possible score you can achieve given Nene's optimal play.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result is `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum number of points you can score starting from the first turn with no cards on the table.

### Correctness:

- The program correctly handles the base cases and the dynamic programming transitions.
- However, the program has a significant issue: the `cards.count(j + 1)` operation is inefficient and can lead to a time complexity of O(n^3) in the worst case, which is not suitable for the given constraints (n can be up to 2 * 10^5).

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to its inefficiency. The `cards.count(j + 1)` operation should be replaced with a more efficient way to track the number of occurrences of each card, such as using a dictionary or a frequency array. This would reduce the time complexity to O(n^2), making it suitable for the problem constraints.
