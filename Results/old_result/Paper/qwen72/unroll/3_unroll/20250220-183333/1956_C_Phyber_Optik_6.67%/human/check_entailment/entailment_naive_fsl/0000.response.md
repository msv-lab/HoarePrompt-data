Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when `n = 1`. According to the problem description, for `n = 1`, the maximum sum should be 1, and only one operation is needed to achieve this. However, the program calculates the sum as 1 and the number of operations as 2, which is incorrect. The correct output for `n = 1` should be:

```
1 1
1 1 1
```

But the program outputs:

```
1 2
1 1 1
2 1 1
```

This is more operations than necessary, and the problem description specifies that the number of operations should be no more than `2n`, but it also notes that the solution should be optimal in terms of the number of operations. For `n = 1`, the optimal number of operations is 1, not 2. Therefore, the program is incorrect for this case.
