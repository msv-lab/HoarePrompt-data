You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #State: The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` from the user. After each iteration, the variables `sum` and `r` will be reset to 0, and the loop will print the final values of `sum` and `n + r`. Additionally, it will print a series of lines based on the value of `n + r`. The state of `t` will remain unchanged, and the loop will continue to execute until all `t` test cases have been processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, where `1 <= t <= 500`. It then processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` from the user, where `1 <= n <= 500`. After processing each test case, the function prints the sum of certain values and the value of `n + r`, where `r` is determined based on the relationship between `n` and `i`. Additionally, it prints a series of lines, each containing a sequence of numbers based on the value of `n + r`. The function does not return any value; it only performs these print operations. The state of `t` remains unchanged throughout the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Nene has an \( n \times n \) matrix initially filled with zeroes.
   - She can perform two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and assign \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the matrix using no more than \( 2n \) operations.

2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by filling each row and each column with the permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of a permutation of integers from 1 to \( n \) is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - Since there are \( n \) rows and \( n \) columns, the maximum possible sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).

3. **Operation Strategy:**
   - To achieve the maximum sum, we can perform \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - Alternatively, we can perform \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
   - The program should output the maximum sum and the operations required to achieve it.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) and updates \( \text{sum} \) and \( r \) based on a condition:
     - If \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) (sum of the permutation) is greater than \( i \times n \), it adds \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to \( \text{sum} \) and sets \( r \) to \( i \).
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to \( \text{sum} \).
   - It prints the calculated sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations:
     - For the first \( n \) operations, it performs Type 1 operations on each row.
     - For the next \( r \) operations, it performs Type 2 operations on each column.

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The program's logic for calculating the sum and the number of operations is incorrect.
   - The sum should be \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) and the number of operations should be \( n \) (or \( 2n \) if both row and column operations are used).
   - The program's logic for determining \( r \) and the sum is flawed and does not match the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum or the number of operations required to achieve it. The logic for determining the sum and the operations is incorrect and does not follow the problem's specifications.
