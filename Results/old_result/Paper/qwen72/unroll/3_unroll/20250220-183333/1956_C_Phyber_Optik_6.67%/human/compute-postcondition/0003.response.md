The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates within a context where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 500. The function returns a value that is determined by the values of `t` and `n`.

Since the function does not explicitly take parameters, it is likely that `t` and `n` are either global variables or are part of a broader context (e.g., a class or another function) that is not shown here. The function returns different values based on the constraints of `t` and `n`.

Functionality: **The function returns a value based on the integers `t` and `n`, where `t` is between 1 and 500, and `n` is between 1 and 500 for each test case.**
