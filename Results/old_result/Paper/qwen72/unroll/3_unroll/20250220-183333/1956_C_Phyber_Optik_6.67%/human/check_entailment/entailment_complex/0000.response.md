Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix \( a \) using no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - The operations allowed are:
     - Type 1: Choose a row \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and set \( a_{i, j} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).
     - Type 2: Choose a column \( i \) and a permutation \( p \) of integers from 1 to \( n \), and set \( a_{j, i} := p_j \) for all \( 1 \le j \le n \).

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It then iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \):
     - If \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \), it sets `r` to \( i \) and adds \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 \) to `sum`.
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to `sum`.
   - After the loop, it prints `sum` and `n + r`.
   - It then prints a series of operations:
     - For \( j \) from 1 to \( n + r \):
       - If \( j \le n \), it prints a Type 1 operation for row \( j \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).
       - Otherwise, it prints a Type 2 operation for column \( j \% n \) with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating `sum` and `r` is flawed. The condition \( n \times (n + 1) // 2 > i \times n \) is not necessary and does not contribute to maximizing the sum.
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by filling the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for each row and each column. This will ensure that each element in the matrix is a distinct integer from 1 to \( n \), and the sum will be \( n \times (n \times (n + 1) // 2) \).
   - The number of operations should be \( 2n \) to ensure that each row and each column is filled with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \).

4. **Correcting the Program**:
   - The correct approach is to perform \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) and \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column with the same permutation.
   - The maximum sum should be \( n \times (n \times (n + 1) // 2) \).

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and does not ensure that the matrix is filled in a way that maximizes the sum.

Correctness: **False**
