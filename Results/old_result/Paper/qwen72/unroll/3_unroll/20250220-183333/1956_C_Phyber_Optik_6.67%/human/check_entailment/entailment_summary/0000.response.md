### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix by performing no more than \( 2n \) operations.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Assign a permutation to a row.
     - Type 2: Assign a permutation to a column.
   - The maximum possible sum is \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), which is the sum of all integers from 1 to \( n \) repeated \( n \) times.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix \( n \).
   - It initializes `sum` and `r` to 0.
   - It iterates over \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) and updates `sum` and `r` based on a condition:
     - If \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is greater than \( i \times n \), it sets `r` to \( i \) and adds \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \) to `sum`.
     - Otherwise, it adds \( i \times n \) to `sum`.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations \( n + r \).
   - It then prints the operations:
     - For the first \( n \) operations, it prints Type 1 operations, assigning the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to each row.
     - For the next \( r \) operations, it prints Type 2 operations, assigning the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) to each column, using \( j \% n \) to ensure the column index is within bounds.

3. **Evaluating the Logic:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum sum \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - The number of operations \( n + r \) is always within the limit of \( 2n \).
   - The operations are correctly formatted and follow the rules of the problem.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The condition `if n * (n + 1) // 2 > i * n` is not necessary for maximizing the sum. The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times is always the maximum possible sum.
   - The variable `r` is not needed for the correct solution. The maximum sum can be achieved by simply filling the matrix with the permutation \( [1, 2, \ldots, n] \) for all rows and columns.

5. **Simplified Solution:**
   - The maximum sum is always \( n \times \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \).
   - The number of operations is always \( 2n \) (filling all rows and columns with the permutation).
   - The operations can be simplified to:
     - \( n \) Type 1 operations to fill each row.
     - \( n \) Type 2 operations to fill each column.

### Conclusion:
The program is logically correct in terms of achieving the maximum sum and ensuring the number of operations is within the limit. However, it includes unnecessary logic and variables. A more straightforward and efficient solution can be implemented.

### Correctness:
**True** (The program is correct, but it can be simplified.)
