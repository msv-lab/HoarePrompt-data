The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. The function returns a list `nums` containing `n` integers. Each integer in the list, except the last one, is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. The last integer in the list is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`. Additionally, the value of `k` is updated to `k - n * ((1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, and returns a list `nums` of `n` integers where each integer, except the last one, is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, and the last integer is `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 + k`.**
