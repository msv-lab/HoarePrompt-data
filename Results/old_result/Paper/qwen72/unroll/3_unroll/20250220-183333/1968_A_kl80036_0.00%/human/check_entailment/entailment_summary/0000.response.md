Reasoning:  
The provided program aims to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized. The program simply outputs \( y = x // 2 \) for each test case. Let's analyze if this approach is correct.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to find \( y \) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - \( y \) must be less than \( x \) and greater than or equal to 1.

2. **Behavior of \( \gcd(x, y) \)**:
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is a divisor of both \( x \) and \( y \).
   - If \( y \) is \( x // 2 \), then \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is a candidate for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

3. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \)**:
   - For \( y = x // 2 \):
     - If \( x \) is even, \( y = x // 2 \) is exactly half of \( x \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = x // 2 \).
     - If \( x \) is odd, \( y = x // 2 \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) that is half of \( x \) rounded down, and \( \gcd(x, y) \) will be 1 (since \( y \) is the largest integer less than \( x \) and not a multiple of \( x \)).
   - In both cases, \( y = x // 2 \) is a valid candidate and often provides a high value for \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For \( x = 10 \), \( y = 5 \). \( \gcd(10, 5) = 5 \), so \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \).
   - For \( x = 7 \), \( y = 3 \). \( \gcd(7, 3) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(7, 3) + 3 = 4 \).
   - For \( x = 21 \), \( y = 10 \). \( \gcd(21, 10) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(21, 10) + 10 = 11 \).
   - For \( x = 100 \), \( y = 50 \). \( \gcd(100, 50) = 50 \), so \( \gcd(100, 50) + 50 = 100 \).
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 \). \( \gcd(2, 1) = 1 \), so \( \gcd(2, 1) + 1 = 2 \).
   - For \( x = 1000 \), \( y = 500 \). \( \gcd(1000, 500) = 500 \), so \( \gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 1000 \).
   - For \( x = 6 \), \( y = 3 \). \( \gcd(6, 3) = 3 \), so \( \gcd(6, 3) + 3 = 6 \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program outputs \( y = x // 2 \), which is a valid and often optimal choice for maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - The program correctly processes the input and outputs the required results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
