You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each of the t test cases, y is the integer result of x // 2 where x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer \( x \).
   - It then sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \) (integer division by 2).
   - Finally, it prints \( y \).

3. **Evaluating the Solution:**
   - The program always sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \).
   - We need to check if \( y = x // 2 \) is a valid solution that maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **GCD Analysis:**
   - For \( y = x // 2 \):
     - If \( x \) is even, \( y \) is \( x / 2 \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = x / 2 \).
     - If \( x \) is odd, \( y \) is \( (x - 1) / 2 \), and \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \).

5. **Maximizing \( \gcd(x, y) + y \):**
   - If \( x \) is even:
     - \( y = x / 2 \)
     - \( \gcd(x, y) = x / 2 \)
     - \( \gcd(x, y) + y = x / 2 + x / 2 = x \)
   - If \( x \) is odd:
     - \( y = (x - 1) / 2 \)
     - \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \)
     - \( \gcd(x, y) + y = 1 + (x - 1) / 2 = (x + 1) / 2 \)

6. **Checking for Better Solutions:**
   - For even \( x \), \( y = x / 2 \) is the best because \( \gcd(x, y) + y = x \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - For odd \( x \), \( y = (x - 1) / 2 \) is a good choice because \( \gcd(x, y) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(x, y) + y = (x + 1) / 2 \), which is a reasonable value. However, we should check if there is a better \( y \) that could give a higher sum.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The program always outputs \( y = x // 2 \), which is a valid solution.
   - For even \( x \), this \( y \) is optimal.
   - For odd \( x \), while \( y = (x - 1) / 2 \) is not necessarily the only optimal solution, it is a valid and reasonable choice that satisfies the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it always outputs a valid \( y \) that satisfies the problem constraints and maximizes \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) for even \( x \). For odd \( x \), it provides a valid and reasonable solution, even though it might not be the only optimal solution.
