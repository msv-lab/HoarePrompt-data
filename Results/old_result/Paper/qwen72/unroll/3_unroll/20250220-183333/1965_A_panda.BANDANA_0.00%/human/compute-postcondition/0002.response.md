Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each test case, it will read an integer `n` and a list `l` of `n` integers. It will then check if the number 1 is present in the list `l`. If 1 is present, it will print 'Bob'. If 1 is not present, it will print 'Alice'. The variables `t`, `n`, `l`, `e`, and `m` will be updated for each test case, but their final values will depend on the last test case processed. The variable `t` will remain unchanged after the loop finishes.**
