Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \(n\). Specifically, the program only handles the cases for \(n = 2\) and \(n = 3\) correctly, but for \(n \geq 4\), the program does not generate a set of points that maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For \(n \geq 4\), the program prints the points:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 4)
- (j, j) for \(j\) from 4 to \(n\)

This does not ensure that the Manhattan distances between all pairs of points are maximized. For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 2)
- (2, 4)
- (4, 4)

The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has a size of 6. However, it is possible to achieve a larger set of distances by choosing different points.

A correct approach would be to place the points in such a way that the Manhattan distances between them are as diverse as possible. One such strategy is to place the points along the diagonal and the anti-diagonal of the grid, which can help maximize the set of distances.

For example, a correct solution for \(n = 4\) could be:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 4)
- (4, 1)
- (4, 4)

This would yield the set of distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 2, 4, 6\}\), which has a size of 4, and is the maximum possible for \(n = 4\).

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect for \(n \geq 4\).
