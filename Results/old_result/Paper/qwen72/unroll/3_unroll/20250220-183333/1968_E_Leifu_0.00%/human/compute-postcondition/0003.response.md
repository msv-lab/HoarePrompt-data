The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 50`. For each test case, it also accepts an integer `n` where `2 <= n <= 10^3`.

The function returns different outputs based on the value of `n` for each test case. The specific output for each test case is not detailed, but it is implied that the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 <= t <= 50`. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` where `2 <= n <= 10^3`. The function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
