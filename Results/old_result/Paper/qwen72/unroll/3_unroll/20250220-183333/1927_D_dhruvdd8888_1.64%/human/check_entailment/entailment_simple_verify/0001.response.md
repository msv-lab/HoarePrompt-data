### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `tc`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `N`, the array `nums`, and the number of queries `q`.
   - It appends `-1` to the array `nums` to handle edge cases, which is a common technique to avoid index out of bounds errors.

2. **Array Compression**:
   - The program iterates through the array `nums` and compresses it into a list of tuples `arr` where each tuple represents a segment of the array with the same value.
   - Each tuple in `arr` contains `(start, end, value)` where `start` and `end` are the indices of the segment, and `value` is the value of the elements in that segment.
   - This compression helps in efficiently handling the queries by reducing the number of elements to check.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each query, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the index `eli` in `arr` where the segment starts at or after the query start index `l`.
   - It then checks the segment boundaries to determine if there is a valid pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `a_i \ne a_j` within the query range `[l, r]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the segment starts after `l`, it checks if the previous segment can provide a valid pair.
   - If the segment ends before `r`, it checks if the next segment can provide a valid pair.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints `-1 -1` indicating no valid pair exists.

5. **Debugging Statements**:
   - The program includes some debugging statements that print the array and query details if `ppp == 23` and `tc > 5`. These statements are not part of the actual logic and can be ignored for correctness evaluation.

6. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Input Management**: The function `func_1` is called inside a loop for each test case, but the function itself reads input, which can lead to incorrect behavior if the input is not properly managed. This is a significant flaw.
   - **Segment Handling**: The program correctly compresses the array and uses binary search to find segments, but it does not handle all edge cases correctly, especially when the segment ends exactly at `r`.
   - **Output**: The program does not always produce the correct output for all queries due to the issues mentioned above.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Input Management**:
  - The function `func_1` reads input using `sys.stdin.readline` inside the function. This can cause issues if the input is not read in the correct order, especially when multiple test cases are involved. The input should be managed outside the function to ensure each test case is processed correctly.

- **Segment Handling**:
  - The program correctly compresses the array into segments and uses binary search to find the relevant segment for each query.
  - However, the logic for handling the segment boundaries is flawed. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the case where the segment ends exactly at `r` and the next segment does not exist.

- **Output**:
  - The program's output logic is incorrect in some cases. For example, if the segment starts at `l` and ends exactly at `r`, the program might incorrectly print `-1 -1` when a valid pair exists.

### Example Case Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Array: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1]`
  - Queries: `[(1, 5), (1, 2), (1, 3)]`
  - Compressed Array: `[(1, 2, 1), (3, 3, 2), (4, 5, 1)]`
  - Query (1, 5): The segment starts at 1 and ends at 5. The program should find a valid pair within the segment, but it might not due to the flawed boundary handling.
  - Query (1, 2): The segment starts at 1 and ends at 2. The program correctly prints `-1 -1` because all elements are the same.
  - Query (1, 3): The segment starts at 1 and ends at 3. The program should find a valid pair, but it might not due to the flawed boundary handling.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Array: `[30, 20, 20, 10, 10, 20]`
  - Queries: `[(1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 5)]`
  - Compressed Array: `[(1, 1, 30), (2, 3, 20), (4, 5, 10), (6, 6, 20)]`
  - Query (1, 2): The segment starts at 1 and ends at 2. The program correctly prints `2 1` because the elements are different.
  - Query (2, 3): The segment starts at 2 and ends at 3. The program correctly prints `-1 -1` because all elements are the same.
  - Query (2, 4): The segment starts at 2 and ends at 4. The program should find a valid pair, but it might not due to the flawed boundary handling.
  - Query (2, 6): The segment starts at 2 and ends at 6. The program should find a valid pair, but it might not due to the flawed boundary handling.
  - Query (3, 5): The segment starts at 3 and ends at 5. The program should find a valid pair, but it might not due to the flawed boundary handling.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program has significant issues with input management and handling edge cases, which can lead to incorrect results for some queries. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Final: **False**
