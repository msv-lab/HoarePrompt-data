Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called within a loop that iterates t times, where t is a non-negative integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). For each iteration, x and y are integers (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9) provided as space-separated inputs.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    for i in range(x):
        x, y = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if x < y:
            print(x, y)
        else:
            print(y, x)
        
    #State: The loop will execute t times, where for each iteration, the values of x and y will be read from the input. If x is less than y, it will print x followed by y. Otherwise, it will print y followed by x. The values of x and y will be updated with each iteration, but the number of iterations t remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `x` from the input, and then for each iteration from 0 to `x-1`, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 9) from the input. For each pair of integers, it prints the smaller integer followed by the larger integer. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `x` and `y` are the last values read from the input, and the program state is unchanged in terms of the number of iterations `t`.
