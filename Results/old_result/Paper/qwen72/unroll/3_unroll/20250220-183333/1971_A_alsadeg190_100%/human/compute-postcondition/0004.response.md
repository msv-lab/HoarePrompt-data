Functionality: ** The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It reads an integer `x` from the input, and then for each iteration from 0 to `x-1`, it reads two integers `x` and `y` (both between 0 and 9) from the input. For each pair of integers, it prints the smaller integer followed by the larger integer. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `x` and `y` are the last values read from the input, and the program state is unchanged in terms of the number of iterations `t`. **
