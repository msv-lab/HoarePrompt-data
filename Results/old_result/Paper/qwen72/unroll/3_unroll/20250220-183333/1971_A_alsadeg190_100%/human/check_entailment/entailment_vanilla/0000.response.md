Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading an integer `x` which represents the number of test cases. This is correct as per the problem statement which specifies that the first line of input contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100).

2. **Loop for Test Cases**: The program then enters a loop that runs `x` times, which is correct because it needs to process each test case individually.

3. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: Inside the loop, the program reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, which is correct as each test case contains two space-separated integers.

4. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**: The program checks if `x` is less than `y`. If it is, it prints `x` followed by `y`. Otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`. This logic is correct because it ensures that the minimum value is always printed first, followed by the maximum value.

5. **Output Format**: The output format is correct as it prints two integers per test case, which is what the problem statement requires.

However, there is a potential issue with variable naming:
- The variable `x` is used both for the number of test cases and for the first integer in each test case. This can lead to confusion and potential bugs if the program is extended or modified. It would be better to use a different variable name for the number of test cases, such as `t`.

Despite this, the program will still work correctly for the given problem description and input constraints.

Correctness: **True**
