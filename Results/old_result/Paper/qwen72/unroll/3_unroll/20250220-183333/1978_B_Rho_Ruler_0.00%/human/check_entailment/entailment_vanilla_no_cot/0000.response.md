Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The function `func_1` is used in a binary search to find the optimal value of `k`, but the logic within `func_1` does not correctly determine the profit for a given `k`. Specifically, the condition `return ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not a valid way to decide whether a particular `k` is optimal. This condition simply checks if the profit for a given `k` is less than or equal to the maximum possible profit if all buns were sold at the higher of the two prices, which does not help in finding the actual maximum profit.

To correctly solve the problem, you should calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` and choose the one that gives the maximum profit. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(min(n, b) + 1):
            profit = sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k)) + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This program iterates over all possible values of `k` (from 0 to `min(n, b)`) and calculates the profit for each value. It then prints the maximum profit found. This approach is straightforward and ensures that the correct maximum profit is calculated for each test case.
