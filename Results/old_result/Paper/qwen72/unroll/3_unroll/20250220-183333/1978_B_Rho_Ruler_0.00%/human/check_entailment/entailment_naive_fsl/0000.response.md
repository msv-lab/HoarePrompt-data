Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The function `func_1` is used in a binary search to find the optimal `k`, but the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is not the correct criterion for determining the maximum profit. The program should instead calculate the profit for different values of `k` and choose the one that maximizes the profit.

Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
4 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
17
```

Actual Output:
```
4
```

The program outputs `4` because it incorrectly uses the binary search to find the maximum `k` that satisfies the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)`, which is not the correct approach to maximize the profit. The correct approach would be to calculate the profit for each possible value of `k` and choose the maximum profit.
