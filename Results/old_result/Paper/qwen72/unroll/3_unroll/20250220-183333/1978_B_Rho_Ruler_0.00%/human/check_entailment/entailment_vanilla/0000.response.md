Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.

2. **Binary Search Setup**: The program initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`, which are the bounds for the binary search. The goal is to find the optimal `k` (number of buns to sell at the modified price) that maximizes the profit.

3. **Binary Search Loop**: The program uses a binary search to find the optimal `k`. The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

4. **Mid Calculation**: The program calculates the middle point `mid` of the current search range.

5. **Condition Check**: The program calls `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` to check if the current `mid` value is a valid candidate for the optimal `k`.

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the profit if `k` buns are sold at the modified price.
   - It adds the profit from the first `k` buns: `k * b`.
   - It adds the profit from the remaining `n - k` buns: `(n - k) * a`.
   - It returns `True` if the calculated profit is less than or equal to `n * max(a, b)`. This condition is not correct for determining the optimal `k`.

7. **Updating `ans` and Search Range**:
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `True`, the program updates `ans` to `mid` and moves the lower bound to `mid + 1`.
   - If `func_1(mid, a, b, n)` returns `False`, the program moves the upper bound to `mid - 1`.

8. **Output**: After the binary search loop, the program prints the value of `ans`.

**Issues**:
- The condition in `func_1` is incorrect. The function should return `True` if the profit from selling `k` buns at the modified price and the remaining buns at the usual price is greater than or equal to the profit from selling all buns at the usual price.
- The binary search is not correctly implemented to find the maximum profit. The condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` does not help in finding the optimal `k`.

**Correct Approach**:
- The optimal `k` should be the one that maximizes the profit. The profit for a given `k` is calculated as:
  - Profit from the first `k` buns: `sum(b - i + 1 for i in range(k))`.
  - Profit from the remaining `n - k` buns: `(n - k) * a`.
- The sum of the first `k` modified prices can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `k * (2 * b - k + 1) // 2`.

**Correctness**: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain. The binary search and the condition in `func_1` are not appropriate for this problem. The correct approach should involve calculating the profit for each possible `k` and selecting the one that maximizes the profit.
