The only objects in the loop head are the variable `card` and the result of `input().split()`, which is expected to be a list of strings. For the loop to execute, the input must be a string that, when split, results in a list with at least one element. The state of `card` will be the first element of this list at the start of the loop.

State: **`card` is the first element from the list generated by `input().split()`, and the input must be a string that, when split, results in a list with at least one element.**
