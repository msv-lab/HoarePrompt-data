Output State: **The `trumps` list contains all the ranks of the cards that have the same suit as the `trump_suit`. The `answers` list contains strings representing pairs of cards that were compared and added to the list when a card of a non-trump suit was encountered and the suit had already been seen before. The `suits` dictionary has the value `None` for all suits that were encountered more than once, and the rank of the last card seen for any suit that was only encountered once.**
