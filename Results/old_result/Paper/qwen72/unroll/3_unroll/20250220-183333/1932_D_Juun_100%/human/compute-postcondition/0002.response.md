Output State: **The function should take three parameters: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16) representing the number of rounds, a character trump_suit ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S') representing the trump suit, and a list of 2n unique two-character strings cards. The variable `trump` is assigned the value of the user input, which is expected to be a character ('C', 'D', 'H', or 'S'). The list `trumps` is initialized as an empty list.**
