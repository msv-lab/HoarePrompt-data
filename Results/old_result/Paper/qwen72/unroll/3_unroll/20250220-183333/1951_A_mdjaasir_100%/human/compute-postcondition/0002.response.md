Output State: **The values of `start`, `end`, and `t` remain unchanged. The loop has executed `t` times, and for each iteration, it has read an integer `n` and a string `a` from the input. Based on the conditions in the loop, it has printed 'YES' or 'NO' to the console for each iteration. The subfolders and .html files in the current directory are not affected by the loop.**
