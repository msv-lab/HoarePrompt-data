The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variables `start` and `end` and the current directory's contents are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`start` and `end` are integers with `start` <= `end`, the current directory contains subfolders named with digits within the range [start, end]. Each of these subfolders may contain .html files, `t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
