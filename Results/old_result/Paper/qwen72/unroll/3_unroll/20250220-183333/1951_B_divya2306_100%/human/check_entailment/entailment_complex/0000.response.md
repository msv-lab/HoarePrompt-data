Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined without parameters, and the parameters `n`, `k`, and `ratings` are read inside the function. This is not consistent with the problem description, which suggests that the function should take these parameters as arguments.
   - The function name `func_1` is not descriptive and does not match the problem's context. It should be named `max_wins` or something similar to reflect its purpose.

2. **Initial Wins Calculation**:
   - The initial loop calculates the number of wins your cow can achieve without any swaps. It iterates through the list `a` and increments `wins` until it finds a cow with a higher rating than your cow.
   - The loop breaks when it encounters a cow with a higher rating, and `wins` is the number of cows your cow can defeat in this initial sequence.

3. **Condition for No Swap**:
   - The condition `if wins >= k:` checks if the number of wins is already sufficient to ensure that your cow wins at least `k-1` matches. If this condition is true, it prints `wins - 1` and returns.
   - This logic is incorrect because it assumes that the number of wins should be greater than or equal to `k`, which is not the correct condition. The correct condition should be `if wins >= n - 1:` to check if your cow can win all remaining matches without any swaps.

4. **Wins Calculation with Swap**:
   - The variable `win_with_swap` is initialized to `wins + 1`, which is incorrect. It should be initialized to `wins` because the swap should not automatically add a win.
   - The second loop calculates the number of additional wins your cow can achieve if it is swapped to a position where it can win more matches. However, the loop starts from `win_with_swap` and goes up to `k - 1`, which is incorrect. It should start from `1` and go up to `k - 1` to consider all possible positions for the swap.
   - The loop breaks when it encounters a cow with a higher rating, and `win_with_swap` is incremented for each cow with a lower rating.

5. **Final Output**:
   - The final output is `print(max(wins - 1, win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)))`, which is intended to print the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.
   - The expression `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)` is incorrect. It should be `win_with_swap - 1` to correctly calculate the number of wins after the swap.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
