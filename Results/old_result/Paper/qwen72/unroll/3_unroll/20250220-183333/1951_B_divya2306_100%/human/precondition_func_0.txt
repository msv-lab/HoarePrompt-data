The function definition is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):` where `n` is an integer representing the number of cows, `k` is an integer representing your cow's index (1 ≤ k ≤ n), and `ratings` is a list of integers of length `n` where each integer represents the Cowdeforces rating of a cow, with all ratings being distinct and within the range 1 to 10^9.
