### Reasoning:

1. **Function Call and Definition:**
   - The function `func_1()` is called in a loop for each test case, but the function definition itself is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The function should be named `max_wins(n, k, ratings)` to clearly indicate its parameters.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the input values for `n`, `k`, and the list of ratings `a`.

3. **Initial Wins Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of wins your cow can achieve without any swaps. It iterates through the list `a` and increments `wins` until it finds a cow with a higher rating than your cow. This part is correct.

4. **Condition for No Swap:**
   - If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the program prints `wins - 1` and returns. This is because if your cow can win all the matches up to its original position, it will win `wins - 1` matches (since the first match is between the first and second cows).

5. **Wins with Swap Calculation:**
   - If `wins` is less than `k`, the program calculates the number of wins your cow can achieve if it is swapped with another cow. It starts by setting `win_with_swap` to `wins + 1` (assuming the cow wins the first match after the swap).
   - It then iterates from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1` to count how many additional matches your cow can win after the swap. This part is also correct.

6. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of `wins - 1` and `win_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins != 0)`. This is intended to account for the number of wins without a swap and the number of wins with a swap, adjusted for the initial win if `wins` is not zero.

### Issues:
- **Function Definition:** The function should be named `max_wins(n, k, ratings)` to match the problem description.
- **Logic for Swap Wins:** The logic for calculating `win_with_swap` is incorrect. The program should consider the optimal position to swap your cow to maximize its wins, not just count the wins from `win_with_swap` to `k - 1`.

### Corrected Logic:
- **Optimal Swap Position:** To maximize the number of wins, you should swap your cow to the position where it can win the most matches. This means finding the position `i` such that your cow can win all matches from position `i` to the end of the list, and `i` is the first position where the cow's rating is less than the rating of the cow in position `i + 1`.

### Correctness:
- The current logic does not correctly handle the optimal swap position, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Correctness: **False**
