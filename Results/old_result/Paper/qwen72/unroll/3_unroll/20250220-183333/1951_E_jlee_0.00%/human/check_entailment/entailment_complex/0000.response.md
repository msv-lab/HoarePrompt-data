### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string` and converts it to a list `s` for easier manipulation.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the string length `n` is 1, the function correctly prints 'NO' because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **First and Last Character Check:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the function correctly prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because a string with different first and last characters cannot be a palindrome.

4. **All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), the function correctly prints 'NO' because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters except one are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), the function checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints 'NO' because the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because a string with one different character can still be a palindrome if the different character is in the middle.

6. **General Case:**
   - The function iterates through the first half of the string to check for non-palindromic substrings.
   - If it finds a pair of characters that are different (`s[j] != s[n - 1 - j]`), it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single non-palindromic substring. This is correct because the string is not a palindrome if any pair of characters from the start and end are different.
   - If the string is a palindrome but has at least two different characters, the function attempts to split the string into two non-palindromic substrings. It uses the variables `count` and `count2` to keep track of the positions of the first and second different characters.
   - If a valid split is found, it prints 'YES' and the two substrings. If no valid split is found, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness:
The function appears to handle all the specified cases correctly. It correctly identifies when a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and when it cannot. The logic for splitting the string into two non-palindromic substrings is also sound.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
