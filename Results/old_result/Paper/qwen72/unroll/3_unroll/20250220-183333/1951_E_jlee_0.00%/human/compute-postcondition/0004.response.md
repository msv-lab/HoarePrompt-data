Functionality: ** The function `func` processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it takes a string `string` consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1 ≤ |string| ≤ 10^6). The function checks if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings such that the first and last characters of the original string are different, or if the string can be split into two non-empty substrings where the first and last characters are the same but the string is not a palindrome. If either condition is met, it prints 'YES' followed by the number of splits (1 or 2) and the resulting substrings. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function has printed the results for each test case, and the variables `i`, `string`, `s`, `n`, `done`, `x`, `count`, and `count2` will hold their final values from the last test case processed. **
