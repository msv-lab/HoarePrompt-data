The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters within its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might be designed to handle multiple test cases, each with parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and the total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the example. To describe the functionality, we can infer that the function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), and returns a result for each test case. The total number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**
