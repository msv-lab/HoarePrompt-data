### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes `rep` to 0, which will be used to count the number of stalls set up.
   - It initializes `number` to 0, which will be used to store the price per jewel for the current stall.
   - It initializes `tab` as an empty list, which will store the prices of the stalls.

3. **Stall Setup and Pricing:**
   - The program uses a while loop to set up the stalls and determine the prices.
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, `rep` is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `Min` and `Max` as the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k`.
   - It then checks if `Max` equals `k` and if `n * Min` is less than or equal to `k`. If this condition is true, it sets `number` to `Min` and decreases `k` by `Max`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `number` to `Max` and decreases `k` by `Min`.
   - It appends the price `number` to the list `tab`.
   - It decreases `n` by `Min * Max` and increments `rep` by 1.

4. **Output:**
   - After the loop, if `k` is zero, it prints "YES", the number of stalls set up, and the prices of the stalls.
   - If `k` is not zero, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Correctness of the Loop:**
  - The loop ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up stalls with appropriate prices.
  - The condition `n * Min <= k` is used to ensure that Alice can buy the required number of jewels without exceeding her coins.
  - The loop correctly decreases `n` and `k` after each iteration, ensuring that the remaining coins and jewels are considered for the next stall.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where `k` is zero correctly by printing "NO" if `k` is not zero after the loop.
  - It also ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60 by checking `rep < 60`.

- **Output Format:**
  - The output format matches the problem description: "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices of the stalls, or "NO" if it is impossible.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described, ensuring that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up at most 60 stalls with appropriate prices. The logic and output format are consistent with the problem requirements.
