Output State: **t is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. After the loop, t is decremented by the number of test cases processed, and for each test case, n is reduced by the sum of products of Min and Max calculated in each iteration, and k is reduced by the sum of Min and Max values used in each iteration. The loop will print 'YES' followed by the length of the tab list and the elements of tab if k is reduced to 0, otherwise it will print 'NO'.**
