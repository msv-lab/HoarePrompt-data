Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by two positive integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). It attempts to reduce `n` by repeatedly subtracting the product of the minimum and maximum of `n // k` and `k` until `n` is less than `k` or a maximum of 60 iterations is reached. If `k` is reduced to 0 within these constraints, the function prints 'YES', the number of iterations performed, and the sequence of numbers used in the reduction. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes up to 1000 test cases. After processing all test cases, the function exits without returning any value. **
