Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect due to the logic used to determine the prices for the stalls and how it handles the distribution of Alice's coins to buy exactly `k` jewels. The algorithm attempts to distribute the remaining coins and jewels across stalls in a way that does not guarantee the correct purchase of `k` jewels. Specifically, the logic for setting `Min` and `Max` and then deciding which to use for the price and the number of jewels to buy is flawed and does not consistently lead to the correct solution.

A correct approach would be to ensure that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels by setting up prices in such a way that she buys one jewel from each of the first `k` stalls, and the price at each stall is set based on the remaining coins and the number of jewels still needed to be bought. This can be achieved by setting the price of the first stall to `n // k` (the maximum number of coins Alice can spend on each jewel to buy `k` jewels exactly), and then setting the price of each subsequent stall to 1 coin, ensuring that Alice can buy the remaining `k-1` jewels with the remaining coins.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from sys import stdin

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, stdin.readline().split())
        if k > 60:
            print('NO')
            continue
        print('YES')
        print(k)
        if k == 1:
            print(n)
        else:
            print(n // k, end=' ')
            for _ in range(1, k):
                print(1, end=' ')
        print()  # Newline for the next test case

func()
```

This version correctly handles the problem by:
1. Checking if `k` is greater than 60, in which case it prints "NO" since Bob cannot set up more than 60 stalls.
2. Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up `k` stalls.
3. The first stall is priced at `n // k` to ensure Alice buys exactly one jewel from it.
4. The remaining stalls are priced at 1 coin each, ensuring Alice buys the remaining `k-1` jewels.

This approach guarantees that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, and it is always possible as long as `k` is 60 or less.
