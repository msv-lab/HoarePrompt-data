Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where `n` is less than `k`. According to the problem description, if Alice has fewer coins than the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, it should be impossible, and the program should output "NO". However, the current implementation does not check this condition properly and may still attempt to set up stalls, leading to incorrect output.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5 6
```
Here, Alice has 5 coins but Bob wants her to buy 6 jewels. Since Alice cannot buy 6 jewels with only 5 coins, the correct output should be:
```
NO
```
However, the program will attempt to set up stalls and may output something like:
```
YES
1
5
```
This is incorrect because Alice cannot buy 6 jewels with only 5 coins. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
