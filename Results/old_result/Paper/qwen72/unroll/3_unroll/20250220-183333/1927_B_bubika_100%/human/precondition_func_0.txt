The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains the trace of a string (the first element of each inner list is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the string, followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n) representing the trace). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5, and it is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists a suitable string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
