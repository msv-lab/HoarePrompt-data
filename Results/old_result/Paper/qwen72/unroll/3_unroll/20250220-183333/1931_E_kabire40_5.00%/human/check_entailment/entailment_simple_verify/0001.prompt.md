You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it processes the list of integers, reverses them, and constructs a new string `rev_res`. If the length of the reversed number is the same as the original, it is directly appended to `rev_res`. Otherwise, the reversed number is added to a list `rev_val`. After processing all numbers, `rev_val` is sorted, and its elements are alternately appended to `rev_res` in their original and reversed forms. Finally, if the integer value of `rev_res` is greater than \(10^{\text{max\_power}}\), it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Game Rules:**
   - Anna and Sasha take turns.
   - Anna reverses the digits of one element.
   - Sasha concatenates two elements and inserts the result back into the list.
   - The game ends when there is exactly one number left in the list.
   - Sasha wins if the final number is not less than \(10^m\).
   - Anna wins otherwise.

2. **Input:**
   - Multiple test cases.
   - Each test case has \(n\) integers and a parameter \(m\).

3. **Output:**
   - For each test case, output "Sasha" if Sasha wins or "Anna" if Anna wins.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It then reads the list of \(n\) integers.

2. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program reverses the digits of each integer in the list.
   - It checks if the reversed integer has the same number of digits as the original integer.
   - If the number of digits is the same, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_res`.
   - If the number of digits is different, it appends the reversed integer to `rev_val`.

3. **Sorting and Concatenating:**
   - The program sorts the `rev_val` list.
   - It then concatenates the elements of `rev_val` to `rev_res` in a specific order:
     - If the index is even, it appends the integer as is.
     - If the index is odd, it appends the integer in reverse order.

4. **Final Check:**
   - The program checks if the final concatenated number is greater than or equal to \(10^m\).
   - If it is, it prints "Sasha".
   - Otherwise, it prints "Anna".

### Issues and Correctness:
1. **Reversing Digits:**
   - The program correctly reverses the digits of each integer.
   - However, it should not be checking if the number of digits is the same. This is unnecessary and incorrect. The game rules do not specify any condition based on the number of digits.

2. **Sorting and Concatenating:**
   - The program sorts the `rev_val` list, which is not necessary for the game rules.
   - The program concatenates elements in a specific order, which is not aligned with the game rules. Sasha can concatenate any two elements in any order, and Anna can reverse any element.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check is correct in terms of comparing the concatenated number to \(10^m\).

### Correct Approach:
- **Anna's Move:**
  - Anna can reverse any element. The optimal strategy for Anna is to reverse the smallest element to minimize the impact on the final number.
- **Sasha's Move:**
  - Sasha can concatenate any two elements. The optimal strategy for Sasha is to concatenate the largest possible elements to maximize the final number.

### Correctness:
- The given program does not follow the optimal strategies for Anna and Sasha.
- It incorrectly sorts and concatenates elements, which does not align with the game rules.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the game rules and optimal strategies for the players. Therefore, it is incorrect.
