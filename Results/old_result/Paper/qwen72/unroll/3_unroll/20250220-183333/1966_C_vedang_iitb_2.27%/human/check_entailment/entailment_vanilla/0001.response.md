### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to remove a positive integer \( k \) of stones from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of integers `a` representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It first sorts the list and removes duplicates to get a new list `a_new`.
   - Then, it modifies `a_new` such that each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the list of pile sizes into a form that can be used to determine the winner more easily.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `n` representing the number of piles.
   - It uses a recursive approach to determine the winner.
   - If there is only one pile (`n == 1`), Alice wins because she can always remove all stones in one move.
   - If there are two piles (`n == 2`), the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If it is even, Alice wins; if it is odd, Bob wins.
   - For more than two piles, the function recursively checks the winner of the game if the smallest pile is removed. If the next player (Bob) loses, Alice wins. If the next player wins and the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Base Cases:**
     - For `n == 1`, Alice wins by removing all stones from the single pile. This is correct.
     - For `n == 2`, the winner depends on the parity of the smallest pile. If the smallest pile is even, Alice can remove all stones from both piles in one move, winning the game. If the smallest pile is odd, Alice must remove one stone, leaving Bob with an even number of stones in both piles, which Bob can then remove to win. This is correct.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - The function `func_2` correctly handles the recursive case by checking if the next player (Bob) loses or wins. If Bob loses, Alice wins. If Bob wins and the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can still win by removing the smallest pile size. If Bob wins and the smallest pile size is 1, Alice cannot win because she must remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving Bob with a winning position.
   - **Transformation by `func_1`:**
     - The transformation performed by `func_1` is crucial for the recursive function `func_2` to work correctly. By converting the list of pile sizes into differences, the function can efficiently determine the winner based on the transformed list.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The combination of `func_1` and `func_2` correctly determines the winner of the game for any valid input.
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the optimal play strategy for the game.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
