Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_2` is flawed, and it does not handle the game's rules optimally. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function sorts the unique values in the list `a` and then computes the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the problem into a simpler form, but it does not correctly handle the game's dynamics. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that the smallest nonempty pile determines the maximum number of stones that can be removed in a turn.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function attempts to determine the winner recursively, but it has several issues:
     - The base cases for `n == 1` and `n == 2` are incorrect. For `n == 1`, the player who goes first (Alice) always wins because they can remove the entire pile in one move. For `n == 2`, the player who goes first wins if the piles are not equal, and the player who goes second wins if the piles are equal.
     - The recursive case is also incorrect. It does not correctly simulate the game's rules. The function should consider the parity of the smallest pile and the number of piles, not just the first element and the rest of the list.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner, we need to consider the parity of the number of piles and the smallest pile size. The key insight is that the game is a Nim game variant where the number of stones removed in each turn is the same for all nonempty piles. The winner can be determined by the parity of the number of piles with an odd number of stones.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def determine_winner(piles):
    odd_count = sum(1 for pile in piles if pile % 2 == 1)
    return "Alice" if odd_count % 2 == 1 else "Bob"

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    piles = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(determine_winner(piles))
```

### Explanation:
- **`determine_winner` Function**:
  - Count the number of piles with an odd number of stones.
  - If the count of odd piles is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.

This approach correctly handles the game's rules and determines the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
