### Reasoning:

1. **func_1 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of positive integers and returns a new list `a_new` where each element (except the first one) is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted unique list `a_temp`.
   - This transformation essentially reduces the problem to a simpler form where the differences between consecutive unique pile sizes are considered. This is a crucial step because it helps in determining the parity (odd or even) of the differences, which is important for the game's outcome.

2. **func_2 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` is a recursive function that determines the winner of the game based on the transformed list `a_new` and the length `n` of this list.
   - **Base Case**:
     - If `n == 1`, the function returns 1, indicating Alice wins. This is correct because if there is only one pile, Alice can always remove all stones and win.
     - If `n == 2`, the function returns 1 if the first element of `a` is even, and 2 if it is odd. This is also correct because if the first element is even, Alice can remove an even number of stones, leaving an odd number of stones in the second pile, which Bob cannot remove in one turn. If the first element is odd, Bob can always win by removing the remaining stones.
   - **Recursive Case**:
     - For `n > 2`, the function recursively checks the sub-list `a[1:]` (i.e., the list without the first element).
     - If the recursive call returns 2 (indicating Bob wins the sub-game), or if it returns 1 and the first element of `a` is not 1, the function returns 1 (indicating Alice wins). This is because if Bob wins the sub-game, Alice can force Bob into a losing position by removing the appropriate number of stones. If the first element is not 1, Alice can always make a move that leaves Bob in a losing position.
     - If the recursive call returns 1 and the first element of `a` is 1, the function returns 2 (indicating Bob wins). This is because if the first element is 1, Alice is forced to remove 1 stone from each pile, which might leave Bob in a winning position.

3. **Overall Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of piles `n` and the list of pile sizes `a`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to transform the list `a` into `a_new`.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2` to determine the winner and prints the result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. The transformation in `func_1` and the recursive decision-making in `func_2` are both logically sound and handle the base and recursive cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
