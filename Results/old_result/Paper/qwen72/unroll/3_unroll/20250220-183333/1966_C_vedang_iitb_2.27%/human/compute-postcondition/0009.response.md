Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers where 1 <= len(a) <= 2 * 10^5, `n` is a positive integer such that n == len(a), `n` is greater than 1, `n` is not equal to 2, `winNext` is the result of `func_2(a[1:], n - 1)`**

Explanation:
- `a` remains a list of positive integers with the same length constraints.
- `n` remains a positive integer equal to the length of `a`, and it is still greater than 1 and not equal to 2.
- `winNext` is assigned the result of the function `func_2` when called with the arguments `a[1:]` (a slice of `a` starting from the second element to the end) and `n - 1` (which is one less than the current length of `a`). The specific value of `winNext` depends on the implementation of `func_2`.
