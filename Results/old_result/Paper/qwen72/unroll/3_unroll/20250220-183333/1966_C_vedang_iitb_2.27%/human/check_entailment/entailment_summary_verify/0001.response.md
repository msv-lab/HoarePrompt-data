### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game:**
   - The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to remove a positive integer \( k \) of stones from each nonempty pile, where \( k \) is at most the size of the smallest nonempty pile.
   - The player who cannot make a move (all piles are empty) loses the game.
   - Both players play optimally, meaning they always make the best possible move to ensure their victory.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(a)`**
   - This function takes a list of integers `a` representing the initial number of stones in each pile.
   - It first sorts the list and removes duplicates to get a new list `a_new`.
   - Then, it modifies `a_new` such that each element is the difference between the current element and the previous element in the sorted list.
   - The purpose of this function is to transform the list of pile sizes into a form that can be used to determine the winner more easily.
   - **Correctness:**
     - Sorting and removing duplicates ensures that the list `a_new` contains unique, sorted pile sizes.
     - The transformation into differences is a valid step because it reduces the problem to a simpler form where the differences between consecutive pile sizes are considered. This transformation helps in determining the parity of the smallest pile size and the subsequent moves.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(a, n)`**
   - This function takes a list `a` and an integer `n` representing the number of piles.
   - It uses a recursive approach to determine the winner.
   - **Base Cases:**
     - For `n == 1`, Alice wins by removing all stones from the single pile. This is correct.
     - For `n == 2`, the winner depends on whether the smallest pile size is even or odd. If it is even, Alice can remove all stones from both piles in one move, winning the game. If it is odd, Alice must remove one stone, leaving Bob with an even number of stones in both piles, which Bob can then remove to win. This is correct.
   - **Recursive Case:**
     - The function `func_2` correctly handles the recursive case by checking if the next player (Bob) loses or wins. If Bob loses, Alice wins. If Bob wins and the smallest pile size is not 1, Alice can still win by removing the smallest pile size. If Bob wins and the smallest pile size is 1, Alice cannot win because she must remove 1 stone from each pile, leaving Bob with a winning position.
     - **Correctness:**
       - The recursive logic is sound. It correctly checks the sub-list `a[1:]` and determines the winner based on the result of the recursive call.
       - The condition `winNext == 2 or (winNext == 1 and a[0] != 1)` ensures that Alice wins if Bob loses or if Bob wins but the smallest pile size is not 1. This is correct.

4. **Combination of Functions:**
   - The transformation performed by `func_1` is crucial for the recursive function `func_2` to work correctly.
   - By converting the list of pile sizes into differences, `func_1` simplifies the problem, making it easier for `func_2` to determine the winner based on the transformed list.
   - **Correctness:**
     - The combination of `func_1` and `func_2` correctly determines the winner of the game for any valid input.
     - The logic in both functions aligns with the optimal play strategy for the game.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly determines the winner of the game for any valid input based on the optimal play strategy.

Final: **True**
