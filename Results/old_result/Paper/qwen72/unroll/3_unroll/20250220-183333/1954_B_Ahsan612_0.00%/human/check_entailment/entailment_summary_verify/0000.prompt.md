You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
from math import inf

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        same = 1
        num = ar[0]
        minn = inf
        i = 1
        while i < len(ar):
            if ar[i] == num:
                same += 1
            else:
                i += 1
                num = ar[i]
                minn = min(minn, same)
                same = 1
            i += 1
        minn = min(minn, same)
        if minn == inf:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(minn)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then calculates the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same in the list `ar`. If all elements in `ar` are different, it prints 1. If the list `ar` is empty or no consecutive elements are the same, it prints -1. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `ar` retain their values for the next test case, while `i`, `same`, and `num` are reset for each new test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

This array is already not beautiful because there are no indices \(i\) (2 ≤ \(i\) ≤ 4) such that \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\). However, the program will still try to find a minimum number of elements to remove, which is incorrect. The correct output for this case should be 0, but the program does not handle this scenario and will output an incorrect result.

Additionally, the program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program will output 1, which is correct for this specific case. However, the logic used to find this result is not robust and may fail in other cases. For instance, consider the input:

```
1
7
3 3 3 5 3 3 3
```

The program will output 3, which is correct, but the logic is not clear and may not handle more complex cases correctly. The program does not properly account for the possibility of removing elements to break the beautiful property in a more optimal way.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Check if the array is already not beautiful.
2. If the array is beautiful, find the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beautiful property.

The current program does not meet these requirements in all potential cases.
