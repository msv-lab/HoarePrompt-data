Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Beautiful Arrays**:
   - The program attempts to find the minimum number of consecutive elements that are the same. However, this does not align with the problem's requirement to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.
   - The problem requires that the array can no longer be made beautiful by the given operation, not just that it has a certain number of consecutive elements that are the same.

2. **Handling of Single Element Arrays**:
   - The program does not handle the case where the array has only one element correctly. According to the problem, a single-element array is beautiful, and it is impossible to make it non-beautiful by removing elements. The program should output `-1` for such cases, but it does not.

3. **Incorrect Minimization**:
   - The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It does not consider the conditions under which the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
- If the array is already non-beautiful, output `0`.
- If the array is beautiful and consists of identical elements, output `-1`.
- Otherwise, find the minimum number of elements to remove to ensure that no valid operation can be performed to make all elements the same.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if n == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Check if all elements are the same
        if len(set(ar)) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Check if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements
        min_remove = inf
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if ar[i - 1] == ar[i + 1]:
                min_remove = min(min_remove, 1)
        
        if min_remove == inf:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(min_remove)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Single Element Array**: Directly output `-1` if the array has only one element.
- **Identical Elements**: If all elements in the array are the same, output `-1` because it is impossible to make it non-beautiful.
- **Finding Minimum Removals**: Iterate through the array and check if any element can be removed to make the array non-beautiful. If such an element is found, the minimum number of removals is `1`. If no such element is found, the array is already non-beautiful, so output `0`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly handles all cases as described in the problem.
