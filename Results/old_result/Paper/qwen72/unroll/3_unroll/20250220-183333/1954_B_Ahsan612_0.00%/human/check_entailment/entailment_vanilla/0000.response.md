Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The variable `same` is initialized to 1, which will be used to count consecutive elements that are the same.
   - The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array `ar[0]`.
   - The variable `minn` is initialized to `inf` (infinity), which will be used to track the minimum number of consecutive elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

3. **Loop Through the Array**:
   - The program iterates through the array using a while loop with index `i`.
   - It checks if the current element `ar[i]` is the same as `num`.
   - If they are the same, it increments `same` to count the consecutive elements.
   - If they are different, it increments `i` by 1 to move to the next element, updates `num` to the current element `ar[i]`, and updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same`.
   - It then resets `same` to 1 to start counting the next sequence of consecutive elements.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, it updates `minn` to the minimum of `minn` and `same` to account for the last sequence of consecutive elements.
   - If `minn` is still `inf`, it means all elements in the array are the same, and it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. Therefore, it prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `minn`, which is the minimum number of consecutive elements that can be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For an array with all elements the same (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), the program correctly identifies that it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful and prints `-1`.
   - For an array with alternating elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`), the program correctly identifies that removing one element (e.g., the last `1`) can make the array non-beautiful and prints `1`.
   - For an array with a single element (e.g., `[1]`), the program correctly identifies that it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful and prints `-1`.
   - For an array with a pattern that can be broken by removing elements (e.g., `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`), the program correctly identifies that removing the first three `3`s can make the array non-beautiful and prints `3`.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic of the program is sound and handles the problem description correctly.
   - It correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove or outputs `-1` if it is impossible.

Correctness: **True**
