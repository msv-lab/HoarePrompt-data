### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \) and \( a_{i-1} = a_{i+1} \)) and replacing \( a_i \) with \( a_{i-1} \).
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array not beautiful. If it's impossible, output -1.

2. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself \( ar \).
   - It initializes `same` to 1, which counts the length of consecutive identical elements.
   - It initializes `num` to the first element of the array and `minn` to infinity, which will store the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - The program then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - If all elements are the same, `minn` will remain infinity, and the program will output -1.
   - Otherwise, it will output the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.

3. **Identifying Issues:**
   - The program correctly identifies the minimum length of consecutive identical elements.
   - However, it does not correctly handle the case where the array is already not beautiful. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`, the program will output 1, which is incorrect because the array is already not beautiful and no elements need to be removed.
   - The program also does not handle the case where the array has only one element, which should always output -1 because a single-element array cannot be made not beautiful by removing elements.

4. **Correcting the Program:**
   - To handle the case where the array is already not beautiful, we need to check if there are any elements that can be removed to make the array not beautiful.
   - For a single-element array, we should directly output -1.

### Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the array is already not beautiful or when the array has only one element. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
