### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, which is acceptable since it reads input directly from `stdin`.
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - The function initializes `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` from the input for each test case.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` for each test case.
   - It correctly adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function initializes `sp` and `bp` to the initial scores of Sasha and Bodya, respectively.
   - It calculates the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` for Bodya and Sasha, respectively, by iterating through the permutation and updating their positions and scores.

4. **Loop and Score Updates**:
   - The loop iterates `k` times, but the loop variable `i` is not used correctly. The loop should iterate `k` times, but the function decrements `k` inside the loop, which is incorrect. The loop should use a different variable to track the number of iterations.
   - The function updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha based on the permutation `p`.
   - It updates the scores `bp` and `sp` by adding the corresponding values from the array `a`.
   - It also updates `bm` and `sm` to the maximum possible scores based on the remaining turns.

5. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After the loop, the function compares the final scores `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - It prints 'Bodya' if `bm` is greater, 'Sasha' if `sm` is greater, and 'Draw' if they are equal.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Loop Variable**: The loop variable `i` is not used correctly. The loop should iterate `k` times, but the function decrements `k` inside the loop, which is incorrect. The loop should use a different variable to track the number of iterations.
- **Score Calculation Logic**: The logic for calculating the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` is flawed. The function should not be recalculating the maximum possible scores inside the loop. Instead, it should simply accumulate the scores based on the moves.

### Corrected Logic:
- The loop should iterate exactly `k` times.
- The scores `bp` and `sp` should be accumulated based on the moves.
- The final scores should be compared directly to determine the winner.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The program has logical errors in the loop and score calculation that need to be fixed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, P_B, P_S = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        P_B -= 1
        P_S -= 1
        
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        
        b = P_B
        s = P_S
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:
- The loop now iterates `k` times correctly.
- The scores `bp` and `sp` are accumulated based on the moves.
- The final scores are compared to determine the winner.

### Correctness:
- **True**: The corrected program correctly implements the game logic and should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
