### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters:**
   - The function `func` is defined without parameters, but it reads inputs inside the function, which is a common approach in competitive programming. This is not necessarily incorrect, but it is not the best practice for code readability and reusability.

2. **Input Reading:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` from the input.
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a` from the input.

3. **Index Adjustment:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to convert them to 0-based indices, which is correct since Python lists are 0-indexed.

4. **Score Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `bp` and `sp` are set to the values of `a[b]` and `a[s]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initialized to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively, which is incorrect. The maximum score should be calculated based on the actual moves and scores accumulated over the `k` turns, not just the initial position multiplied by `k`.

5. **Game Simulation:**
   - The loop iterates `k` times, simulating each turn of the game.
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated to `p[b] - 1` and `p[s] - 1` respectively, which is correct as it moves the players to their new positions in the permutation.
   - The scores `bp` and `sp` are updated by adding the current position's value from `a` to the respective scores.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are updated using `max(bm, a[b] * k + bp)` and `max(sm, a[s] * k + sp)`, which is incorrect. The maximum score should be the sum of the scores accumulated over the turns, not a multiplication.

6. **Final Comparison:**
   - After the loop, the function compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - The comparison logic is correct, but the values of `bm` and `sm` are not calculated correctly.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program is incorrect because the maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are calculated incorrectly. The maximum score should be the sum of the scores accumulated over the `k` turns, not a multiplication. The current logic for updating `bm` and `sm` does not reflect the correct game dynamics.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, P_B, P_S = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        P_B -= 1
        P_S -= 1
        
        bp = 0
        sp = 0
        
        b = P_B
        s = P_S
        
        for _ in range(k):
            bp += a[b]
            sp += a[s]
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        if bp > sp:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bp < sp:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')
```

In the corrected code, the scores `bp` and `sp` are initialized to 0 and updated correctly by summing the values from `a` over the `k` turns. The positions `b` and `s` are also updated correctly based on the permutation `p`. This ensures that the final scores are calculated correctly, and the winner is determined based on the correct scores.
