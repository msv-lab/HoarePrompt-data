Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program has a few issues that can lead to incorrect results:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha. It uses `bm` and `sm` to store the maximum possible scores, but it does not correctly account for the fact that players can choose to stay at their current position or move to `p_x` on each turn.
   - The logic for updating `bm` and `sm` is flawed. It should consider the scores for staying and moving at each turn, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loop runs `n` times, but the game only lasts `k` turns. The loop should run `k` times, not `n` times.
   - The loop also decrements `k` by 1 for each iteration, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results if `k` is less than `n`.

3. **Incorrect Indexing:**
   - The program subtracts 1 from `b` and `s` to convert them to 0-based indices, which is correct. However, when updating `b` and `s` inside the loop, it subtracts 1 from `p[b]` and `p[s]`, which is incorrect because `p` is already 1-based. This can lead to out-of-bounds errors or incorrect positions.

4. **Incorrect Score Calculation:**
   - The program should calculate the score for each player at each turn, considering both the option to stay and the option to move. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game for `k` turns, keeping track of the scores for both Bodya and Sasha. For each turn, you should consider the score if the player stays at the current position and the score if the player moves to the next position. The player should choose the option that maximizes their score.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, b, s) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Convert to 0-based index
        b -= 1
        s -= 1
        
        # Initialize scores
        bodya_score = 0
        sasha_score = 0
        
        # Simulate the game for k turns
        for _ in range(k):
            # Calculate scores for staying and moving
            stay_bodya = bodya_score + a[b]
            move_bodya = bodya_score + a[p[b] - 1]
            
            stay_sasha = sasha_score + a[s]
            move_sasha = sasha_score + a[p[s] - 1]
            
            # Choose the option that maximizes the score
            bodya_score = max(stay_bodya, move_bodya)
            sasha_score = max(stay_sasha, move_sasha)
            
            # Update positions
            b = p[b] - 1
            s = p[s] - 1
        
        # Determine the winner
        if bodya_score > sasha_score:
            print('Bodya')
        elif bodya_score < sasha_score:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Draw')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

- **Initialization:**
  - Convert `b` and `s` to 0-based indices.
  - Initialize `bodya_score` and `sasha_score` to 0.

- **Simulation:**
  - For each turn, calculate the score if the player stays at the current position and the score if the player moves to the next position.
  - Choose the option that maximizes the score for each player.
  - Update the positions for the next turn.

- **Determine the Winner:**
  - After `k` turns, compare the scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

This corrected program should correctly determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description.
