Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, processing each test case. For each test case, the variables `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` are updated based on the input. After processing each test case, the loop prints 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison of `bm` and `sm`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `b`, `s`, `p`, and `a` are reset for the next test case, and the loop continues until all `t` test cases are processed.**
