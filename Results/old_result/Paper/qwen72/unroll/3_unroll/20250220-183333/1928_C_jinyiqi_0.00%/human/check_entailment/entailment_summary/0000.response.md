### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the number of valid `k` values that fit the given constraints for a specific `n` (Vasya's position) and `x` (the number Vasya received).
   - The pattern of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions. This means that for a given `n` and `x`, we need to find all `k` such that the number `x` appears at position `n` in the described pattern.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of length `k`.
   - For a given `k`, the number `x` can appear in two possible positions:
     - In the increasing sequence: positions `x`, `x + (2k - 2)`, `x + 2(2k - 2)`, etc.
     - In the decreasing sequence: positions `2k - x`, `2k - x + (2k - 2)`, `2k - x + 2(2k - 2)`, etc.
   - Therefore, `n` can be expressed as:
     - \( n = x + m(2k - 2) \) for some integer \( m \)
     - \( n = 2k - x + m(2k - 2) \) for some integer \( m \)

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program uses the function `func_1` to find all divisors of a given number.
   - For each test case, it checks two conditions:
     - \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \)
   - If these conditions are met, it finds the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) using `func_1`.
   - It then filters these divisors to find valid `k` values that satisfy the constraints \( (s + 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (s + 2) / 2 \geq x \).

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in a specific order.
   - The function works efficiently by only iterating up to the square root of `x` and then appending both the divisor and its complement.

5. **Main Logic Analysis:**
   - The main logic correctly checks the conditions \( (n + x - 2) \% 2 == 0 \) and \( (n - x) \% 2 == 0 \).
   - It then uses `func_1` to find the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - The filtering logic ensures that only valid `k` values are added to the `output` list.
   - The use of `set` to remove duplicates is appropriate.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid by ensuring \( k > 1 \).
   - The program also handles the constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values for each test case. The use of `func_1` to find divisors and the filtering logic to ensure valid `k` values are both appropriate and efficient.

**Correctness: True**
