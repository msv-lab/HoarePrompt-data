### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves a pattern where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), followed by the next \( k-2 \) people numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya is at position \( n \) and received number \( x \). We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) (where \( k > 1 \)) fit the given constraints.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It then checks two conditions:
     - If \( (n + x - 2) \) is even, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` and processes the result.
     - If \( (n - x) \) is even, it calls `func_1(n - x)` and processes the result.
   - `func_1` is a function that returns all divisors of a given number \( x \) in a specific order.
   - The program appends valid \( k \) values to the `output` list and ensures that each \( k \) is unique by converting the list to a set.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of \( x \) and returns them in a list.
   - It iterates from 1 to the square root of \( x \) and checks if \( x \) is divisible by the current number \( i \). If so, it adds both \( i \) and \( x / i \) to the lists `output1` and `output2`.
   - `output1` contains divisors less than or equal to the square root of \( x \) in descending order, and `output2` contains divisors greater than the square root of \( x \) in ascending order.
   - The function returns the combined list of divisors.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program checks if \( (n + x - 2) \) and \( (n - x) \) are even. This is because the pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions, and \( n \) and \( x \) must align with this pattern.
   - For each valid divisor \( s \) of \( (n + x - 2) \) or \( (n - x) \), it checks if \( (s + 2) / 2 \) is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to \( x \). If so, it appends \( (s + 2) / 2 \) to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it ensures that the `output` list contains unique values by converting it to a set and then back to a list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \( k = 1 \) is not valid.
   - It also ensures that the divisors are processed correctly and that the final output is unique.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It correctly identifies the divisors and checks the conditions to determine valid \( k \) values. The use of sets to ensure uniqueness is appropriate.
