You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) / 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) / 2)
    output = list(set(output))

def func_1(x):
    output1 = []
    output2 = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output1.append(i)
            output2.append(int(x / i))
    output1.reverse()
    return output2 + output1



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9) and returns a list of all divisors of `x`. The list contains divisors greater than the square root of `x` in their original order, followed by divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x` in descending order.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem describes a pattern of numbering in a line where the first \( k \) people are numbered from 1 to \( k \), the next \( k-2 \) people are numbered from \( k-1 \) to 2, and this pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - Vasya remembers his position \( n \) and the number \( x \) he received. We need to determine how many natural numbers \( k \) fit this pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - For a given \( n \) and \( x \), \( n \) must be congruent to \( x \) or \( 2k-1-x \) modulo \( 2k-2 \).

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - We need to find \( k \) such that \( n \equiv x \pmod{2k-2} \) or \( n \equiv 2k-1-x \pmod{2k-2} \).
   - This can be rewritten as:
     - \( n - x \equiv 0 \pmod{2k-2} \)
     - \( n - (2k-1-x) \equiv 0 \pmod{2k-2} \) which simplifies to \( n + x - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{2k-2} \).

4. **Divisors and Valid \( k \)**:
   - We need to find all divisors of \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \) that are of the form \( 2k-2 \).
   - For each divisor \( d \), \( k \) can be calculated as \( k = \frac{d + 2}{2} \).
   - \( k \) must be a natural number greater than 1 and \( k \geq x \).

5. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( x \).
   - It checks if \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \) are even.
   - It calls `func_1` to find all divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It filters the divisors to ensure \( k \) is a natural number greater than 1 and \( k \geq x \).
   - It uses a set to remove duplicates and then prints the number of valid \( k \).

6. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` finds all divisors of a given number \( x \).
   - It iterates from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \) and checks if \( x \) is divisible by \( i \).
   - It appends both \( i \) and \( \frac{x}{i} \) to the list of divisors.
   - It reverses the list of smaller divisors and concatenates it with the list of larger divisors.

7. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of \( n + x - 2 \) and \( n - x \).
   - It correctly filters the divisors to find valid \( k \).
   - It uses a set to ensure that each \( k \) is counted only once.
   - The logic for checking the conditions \( k > 1 \) and \( k \geq x \) is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
