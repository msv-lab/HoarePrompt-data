The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if the range from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` contains at least one value. This means that `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than 1, which simplifies to `int(x ** 0.5)` being at least 1. Since `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `int(x ** 0.5)` will always be at least 1, ensuring the loop can execute.

However, for the loop to start, `i` must be initialized to 1, and `x` must be within the given range to ensure the loop has a valid range to iterate over.

State: **`x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, `output1` is an empty list, `output2` is an empty list, `i` is 1**
