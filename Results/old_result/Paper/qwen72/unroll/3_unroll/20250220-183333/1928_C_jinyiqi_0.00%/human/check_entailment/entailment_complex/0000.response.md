### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem describes a pattern in which students are assigned numbers in a line. The pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.
   - For a given position `n` and number `x`, we need to determine how many natural numbers `k` (where `k > 1`) fit the pattern such that Vasya receives the number `x` at position `n`.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The pattern alternates between increasing and decreasing sequences of numbers.
   - For the first `k` positions, the numbers are `1, 2, 3, ..., k`.
   - For the next `k-2` positions, the numbers are `k-1, k-2, ..., 2`.
   - This pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions.

3. **Mathematical Formulation:**
   - To find the valid `k` values, we need to check if `n` can be expressed in terms of `k` such that Vasya receives the number `x`.
   - The position `n` can be expressed as `n = m * (2k - 2) + r`, where `m` is the number of complete cycles and `r` is the remainder.
   - The number `x` can be assigned to Vasya in two possible scenarios:
     - `r` is within the first `k` positions: `1 ≤ r ≤ k` and `x = r`.
     - `r` is within the next `k-2` positions: `k+1 ≤ r ≤ 2k-2` and `x = 2k - r`.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates two values: `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - It then calls `func_1` to find all divisors of these values.
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of all divisors of `x` in a specific order.
   - The program checks if the divisors, when adjusted by 2, are valid `k` values and appends them to the `output` list.
   - Finally, it removes duplicates from the `output` list and prints the length of the list.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `x` and returns them in the specified order.
   - It uses a loop to find divisors and stores them in two lists: `output1` for divisors less than or equal to the square root of `x`, and `output2` for divisors greater than the square root of `x`.
   - The function reverses `output1` and concatenates it with `output2` to return the final list of divisors.

6. **Validation of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the divisors of `n + x - 2` and `n - x`.
   - It checks if these divisors, when adjusted by 2, are valid `k` values and ensures that `k` is greater than or equal to `x`.
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
