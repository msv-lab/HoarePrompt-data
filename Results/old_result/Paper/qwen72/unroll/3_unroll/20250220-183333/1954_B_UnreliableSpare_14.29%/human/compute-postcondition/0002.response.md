Output State: **The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The array `a` is a beautiful array, meaning it can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The length of the array `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` of the array is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5. `n` is assigned the value of an input integer. `arr` is a list of integers input by the user. `flag` is True.**
