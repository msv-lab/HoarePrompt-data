Reasoning:  
The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. However, the logic implemented in the program has some issues:

1. **Checking if all elements are the same:**
   - The program correctly checks if all elements in the array are the same using the `flag` variable. If they are, it prints `-1`, which is the correct behavior because an array of identical elements will always remain beautiful no matter how many elements are removed.

2. **Calculating the minimum number of elements to remove:**
   - The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element (`arr[0]`) and prints this count. However, this logic is flawed:
     - It only considers the first element and counts consecutive occurrences of this element. This does not account for other possible sequences or elements that might need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.
     - The program does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition. It should consider all possible sequences of elements that can be made equal by the operations and find the minimum number of removals required to break any such sequence.

3. **Handling the beauty condition:**
   - The beauty condition allows for operations where `a[i-1] == a[i+1]` and `a[i]` can be replaced with `a[i-1]`. The program does not explicitly handle this condition. Instead, it only checks for consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is insufficient.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum count of consecutive elements equal to the first element, which is not the correct approach to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
