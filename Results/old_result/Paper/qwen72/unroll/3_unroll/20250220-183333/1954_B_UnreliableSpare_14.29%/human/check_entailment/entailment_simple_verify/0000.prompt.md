You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a list of integers `a` and the length of the list `n` as parameters. Additionally, the function is part of a solution that processes multiple test cases, so it should also take the number of test cases `t` as an input, though this is typically handled in the outer loop of the program rather than being passed to the function for each test case. The array `a` is a beautiful array, meaning it can be modified to have all elements the same by performing the specified operation. The length of the array `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5, and each element `a_i` of the array is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    flag = True
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            flag = False
            break
        
    #State: The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. The value of `flag` will be False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` will remain True.
    ans = Decimal('Infinity')
    val, cnt = arr[0], 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == val:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            ans = min(ans, cnt)
        
    #State: The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. The value of `flag` will be False if any two consecutive elements in `arr` are different; otherwise, `flag` will remain True. `ans` is set to the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` (the first element of `arr`) found in the array, or remains Decimal('Infinity') if no such consecutive elements are found. `val` is set to the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is set to the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` found in the array.
    ans = min(ans, cnt)
    if flag :
        print(-1)
        #This is printed: -1
    else :
        print(ans)
        #This is printed: ans (where ans is the minimum of the previous value of ans and the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of arr)
    #State: *The value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `arr` remains unchanged. `val` is set to the first element of `arr`. `cnt` is set to the count of the last sequence of consecutive elements that are equal to `val` found in the array. `ans` is set to the minimum of the previous value of `ans` and `cnt`. If `flag` was initially True, it remains True, and all consecutive elements in `arr` are the same. If `flag` was initially False, it remains False, and there are at least two consecutive elements in `arr` that are different.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the array is not entirely composed of the same elements but still meets the criteria of being a "beautiful" array. For example, consider the input:

```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program will output `1`, which is correct. However, consider the input:

```
1
4
1 2 1 2
```

The program will output `1`, but this is incorrect. The correct output should be `2` because you need to remove two elements to make the array stop being beautiful. The array after removing two elements could be `[1, 2]` or `[2, 1]`, neither of which can be made beautiful with the given operations.

The issue lies in the logic where the program calculates the minimum number of elements to remove. It assumes that the minimum number of elements to remove is the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same, but this does not always lead to the correct result for arrays that are not entirely composed of the same elements.
