Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `arr` from the user. It checks if all elements in `arr` are the same. If they are, it prints `-1`. If they are not, it calculates the minimum count of consecutive elements that are equal to the first element of `arr` and prints this count. The function does not modify the input `n` or `arr`. **
