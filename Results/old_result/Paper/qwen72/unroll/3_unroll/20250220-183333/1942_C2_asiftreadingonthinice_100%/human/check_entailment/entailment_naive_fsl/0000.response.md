Correctness: **False**.

### Explanation of the Incorrect Case

Consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output from the Program:**
```
2
```

**Explanation:**
- The polygon has 5 sides, and Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3.
- You can choose up to 2 additional vertices.
- The optimal solution is to choose vertices 2 and 4, which will result in 3 non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake: (1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), and (3, 4, 5).

However, the program does not handle this case correctly. It calculates the number of triangles based on the differences between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices, but it fails to account for the possibility of forming additional triangles by choosing vertices that are adjacent to the already chosen vertices. In this specific case, the program only counts 2 triangles, which is incorrect.
