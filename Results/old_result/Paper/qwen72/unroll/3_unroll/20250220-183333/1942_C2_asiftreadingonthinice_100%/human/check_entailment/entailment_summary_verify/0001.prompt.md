You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n`. It calculates the minimum number of pairs of consecutive integers that can be formed from the list `a` and the additional pairs that can be formed using the integer `y`. The final result is the minimum value between the calculated number of pairs and `n - 2`. The function prints this result for each test case. After the function concludes, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be the last values read from the input during the final iteration, the list `a` will be the last list of integers read and sorted, and the list `tmp` will be the last list of integers generated and sorted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - We can choose up to \( y \) additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads the \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie and sorts them.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation**:
   - The initial number of triangles that can be formed is \( x + y - 2 \). This is because each additional vertex can potentially form a new triangle with the existing vertices.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it means a triangle can be formed directly, so the answer is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even, it means we can potentially add more vertices to form triangles. The gap size is divided by 2 and added to a list `tmp`.

5. **Handling the Gap Between the First and Last Vertex**:
   - The function also checks the gap between the first and last vertex in the sorted list, considering the polygon's cyclic nature.
   - Similar to the previous step, if the gap is exactly 2, the answer is incremented by 1.
   - If the gap is even, it is divided by 2 and added to the list `tmp`.

6. **Maximizing the Number of Triangles**:
   - The list `tmp` is sorted to prioritize smaller gaps.
   - The function iterates through `tmp` and checks if the remaining \( y \) vertices can be used to fill the gaps.
   - If \( y \) is greater than or equal to \( i - 1 \) (where \( i \) is the gap size), the answer is incremented by \( i \) and \( y \) is decremented by \( i - 1 \).
   - If \( y \) is less than \( i - 1 \), the loop breaks as we can't fill the gap.

7. **Final Answer**:
   - After processing all gaps, any remaining \( y \) vertices are added to the answer.
   - The final answer is the minimum of the calculated answer and \( n - 2 \) (the maximum number of triangles that can be formed in a polygon with \( n \) sides).

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output format.
- It correctly calculates the initial number of triangles that can be formed.
- It correctly identifies and processes gaps between chosen vertices.
- It correctly handles the cyclic nature of the polygon.
- The logic for maximizing the number of triangles by filling gaps is sound.
- The final answer is correctly constrained by the maximum possible number of triangles in the polygon.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
