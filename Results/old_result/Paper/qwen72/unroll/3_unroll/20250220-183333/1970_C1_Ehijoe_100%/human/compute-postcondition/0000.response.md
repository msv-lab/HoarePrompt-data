The provided code snippet reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `t`. The variables `n` and `t` will now hold the values provided by the input. The initial state mentions that the function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description, but this information is not directly affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, the function `func_1` is incomplete and does not match the problem description.**
