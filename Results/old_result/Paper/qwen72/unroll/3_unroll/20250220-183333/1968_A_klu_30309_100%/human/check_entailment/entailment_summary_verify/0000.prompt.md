You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of integers `test_cases`. For each integer `x` in `test_cases`, it finds the largest integer `y` (1 <= y < x) that maximizes the sum of `y` and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y`. The function returns a list of these `y` values. The input `t` is not used within the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the logic for finding the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for \(1 \le y < x\). The issue lies in the `break` statement within the loop that iterates over possible values of \(y\). The `break` statement causes the loop to terminate as soon as a value of \(y\) is found that has a higher sum than the current maximum, which means the loop does not check all possible values of \(y\) to ensure the maximum sum is found. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider \(x = 10\):
- The loop starts with \(y = 9\), and \(\gcd(10, 9) + 9 = 1 + 9 = 10\).
- The loop then breaks, and the result is \(9\).

However, the correct answer should be \(5\), because \(\gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10\), which is also the maximum possible sum. The program fails to find this correct \(y\) because it breaks the loop too early.
