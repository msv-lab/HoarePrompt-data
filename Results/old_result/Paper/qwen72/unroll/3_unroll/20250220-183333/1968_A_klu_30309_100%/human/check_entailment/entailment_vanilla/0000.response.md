### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` integers, storing them in the list `test_cases`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (list of integers).

3. **Initialization:**
   - For each test case `x`, the program initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1. This is a reasonable starting point because the smallest possible value for `y` is 1, and the sum `gcd(x, 1) + 1` is always 1 + 1 = 2.

4. **Loop to Find Best y:**
   - The program iterates over possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1. This ensures that `y` is always less than `x` and covers all possible values.

5. **GCD Calculation:**
   - For each `y`, the program calculates the GCD of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd(x, y)`.

6. **Sum Calculation and Comparison:**
   - The program calculates the sum `gcd_val + y` and checks if it is greater than the current `max_sum`.
   - If the new sum is greater, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current `y`.

7. **Early Break:**
   - The program includes a `break` statement after finding the first `y` that maximizes the sum. This is incorrect because it may not always find the optimal `y`. The loop should continue to check all possible values of `y` to ensure the maximum sum is found.

8. **Result Collection:**
   - The program appends the best `y` found for each test case to the `results` list.

9. **Output:**
   - The program prints each result in the `results` list.

### Correctness:
- The program is **incorrect** because it includes a `break` statement after finding the first `y` that maximizes the sum. This means it may not find the optimal `y` for some test cases, especially when the optimal `y` is not the first one encountered in the loop.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program without the `break` statement:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
        results.append(best_y)
    return results
```

### Correctness:
- **False** (The original program is incorrect due to the early break statement.)

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- The loop now continues to check all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1, ensuring that the maximum possible sum of `gcd(x, y) + y` is found.
- The `best_y` is updated only if a new maximum sum is found, and the loop completes for all values of `y`.

This ensures that the program finds the correct `y` for each test case.
