### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Over Test Cases:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation `p`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Index:**
   - The variable `maxi` is initialized to 0. This variable will store the index of the element in the permutation that is part of the pair with the maximum XOR value.
   - The first loop iterates over the range `1` to `n-1` and queries the comparison of `(p_maxi | p_maxi)` with `(p_i | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p_i` is greater than `p_maxi`, so `maxi` is updated to `i`.
   - This loop ensures that `maxi` is the index of the maximum element in the permutation.

3. **Finding Potential Candidates:**
   - The list `arr` is initialized with `[0]`. This list will store indices that have the same maximum value as `p_maxi` when compared using the bitwise OR operation.
   - The second loop iterates over the range `1` to `n-1` and queries the comparison of `(p_maxi | p_arr[0])` with `(p_maxi | p_i)`.
   - If the result is `<`, it means `p_i` is greater than `p_arr[0]` when ORed with `p_maxi`, so `arr` is updated to `[i]`.
   - If the result is `=`, it means `p_i` is equal to `p_arr[0]` when ORed with `p_maxi`, so `i` is appended to `arr`.
   - This loop ensures that `arr` contains all indices that have the same maximum value when ORed with `p_maxi`.

4. **Finding the Minimum Index:**
   - The variable `mini` is initialized to the first element in `arr`.
   - The third loop iterates over the elements in `arr` starting from the second element and queries the comparison of `(p_mini | p_mini)` with `(p_item | p_item)`.
   - If the result is `>`, it means `p_item` is less than `p_mini`, so `mini` is updated to `item`.
   - This loop ensures that `mini` is the index of the minimum element among the candidates in `arr`.

5. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The function outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` with the `!` command, indicating that `p_maxi ⊕ p_mini` is the maximum XOR value.
   - The function then proceeds to the next test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Maximum Index Selection:**
  - The first loop correctly identifies the index of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing `p_i` with `p_maxi` using the bitwise OR operation. This is because `p_i | p_i` is simply `p_i`, and the loop updates `maxi` to the index of the maximum element.

- **Potential Candidates Selection:**
  - The second loop correctly identifies all indices that have the same maximum value when ORed with `p_maxi`. This is because `p_maxi | p_i` will be equal to `p_maxi` if `p_i` is a candidate for the maximum XOR value.

- **Minimum Index Selection:**
  - The third loop correctly identifies the minimum index among the candidates in `arr`. This is because `p_mini | p_mini` is simply `p_mini`, and the loop updates `mini` to the index of the minimum element among the candidates.

- **Query Count:**
  - The total number of queries is `n-1` (from the first loop) + `n-1` (from the second loop) + `len(arr)-1` (from the third loop). Since `len(arr)` is at most `n`, the total number of queries is at most `3n-3`, which is within the allowed limit of `3n`.

- **Output:**
  - The function outputs the indices `maxi` and `mini` for each test case, which should satisfy the condition that `p_maxi ⊕ p_mini` is maximized.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem by finding a pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value within the allowed number of queries. Therefore, the program is correct.
