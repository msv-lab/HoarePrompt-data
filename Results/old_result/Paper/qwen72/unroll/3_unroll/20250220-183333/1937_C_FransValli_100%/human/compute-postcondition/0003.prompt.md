You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates in an interactive environment with multiple test cases. Each test case involves a permutation p of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. The function can query the comparison of bitwise OR results of four chosen indices (a, b, c, d) within the permutation, and must find a pair of indices (i, j) such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, using at most 3n queries. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: The loop will output the indices (maxi, mini) for each test case, where maxi and mini are the indices in the permutation p such that p_maxi ⊕ p_mini is maximized. The variables n, maxi, arr, and mini will be updated for each test case, but their final values will be specific to the last test case processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function operates in an interactive environment to find a pair of indices (i, j) in a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, such that the bitwise XOR of `p_i` and `p_j` is maximized, using at most 3n queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
