The function operates in an interactive environment to process multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4, and finds a pair of indices (maxi, mini) such that the bitwise XOR of `p[maxi]` and `p[mini]` is maximized. It uses at most 3n queries to achieve this. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the indices (maxi, mini) for each test case where `p[maxi] ⊕ p[mini]` is maximized. The variables `n`, `maxi`, `arr`, and `mini` are updated for each test case, but their final values will be specific to the last test case processed.
