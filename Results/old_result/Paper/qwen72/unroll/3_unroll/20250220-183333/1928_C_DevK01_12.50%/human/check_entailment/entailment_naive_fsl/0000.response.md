Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a few issues that make it incorrect for some potential cases:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`**: The program calculates `y = n + x`. However, based on the problem description, the correct approach should involve checking the position and the number received to determine the possible values of `k`. The calculation `y = n + x` does not align with the problem's requirements.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a number, but it is not clear how this function is supposed to help in determining the valid values of `k`. The logic inside `func_1` is also flawed. For example, the condition `if w == w // 1` is not a valid way to check if `w` is an integer. Instead, `if w == int(w)` should be used.

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, when `n` and `x` are such that `n < 3 * x - 2`, the program should not add the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`, but it does so without proper checks.

4. **Incorrect Output for Some Cases**: The program may output incorrect results for certain inputs. For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `x = 2`. The correct output should be `4` (as mentioned in the problem description), but the program's logic might not produce this result correctly.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `n = 10` and `x = 2`:
- The program calculates `y = 10 + 2 = 12`.
- It then checks if `12 % 2 != 0`, which is `False`.
- It proceeds to call `func_1((12 - 2) // 2, 2)`, which is `func_1(5, 2)`.
- The function `func_1` will return an empty list because `5` has no divisors greater than or equal to `1` (which is `x - 1`).
- The program then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2`, which is `10 >= 4`, which is `True`.
- It calls `func_1((10 - 2) // 2, 2)`, which is `func_1(4, 2)`.
- The function `func_1` will return `[2]` because `4` has `2` as a divisor.
- The program then converts this list to a set and prints the length, which is `1`.

However, the correct output for `n = 10` and `x = 2` should be `4`, as the valid values of `k` are `2, 3, 5, 6`.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
