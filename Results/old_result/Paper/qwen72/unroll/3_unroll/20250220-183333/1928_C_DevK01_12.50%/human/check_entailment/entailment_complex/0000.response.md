Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x` from the input.

2. **Initial Check for Odd Sum**:
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`.
   - If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because for any valid `k`, the sum `n + x` must be even. This is because the sequence of numbers repeats every `2k - 2` positions, and the positions and numbers are structured in a way that ensures `n + x` is always even.

3. **Function Call and List Handling**:
   - If `y` is even, the program calls `func_1` with arguments `((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and, if true, calls `func_1` again with arguments `((n - x) // 2, x)`.
   - The results from both function calls are combined into a list `L1`, and duplicates are removed using `set`.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two integers `q` and `x` and returns a list of divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It first calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds the square root to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates over all integers from `1` to `int(w) - 1` (where `w` is the square root of `q`), and for each integer `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `q`. If `i` is a divisor and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, it adds `i` to the list `M`. Similarly, it checks if `q // i` is a divisor and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, and adds it to the list `M` if true.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the list `L1`, which represents the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Even Sum Check**: The initial check for `y` being even is correct because the sequence structure ensures that `n + x` must be even.
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly identifies divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - The use of the square root to limit the range of the loop is efficient and correct.
  - The function correctly handles the case where the square root of `q` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Test Case with `n >= 3 * x - 2`**: The program correctly handles this case by calling `func_1` with `((n - x) // 2, x)` and combining the results.
- **Test Case with `n < 3 * x - 2`**: The program correctly handles this case by only calling `func_1` once with `((y - 2) // 2, x)`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of different `k` values that fit the given constraints. The function `func_1` is used appropriately to find the divisors, and the program handles edge cases and input constraints correctly.

Correctness: **True**
