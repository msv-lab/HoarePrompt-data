Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if Bob can cut a rectangle of size \( a \times b \) into two smaller rectangles and then form a different rectangle from those two smaller rectangles. The key observation here is that for Bob to form a different rectangle, at least one of the dimensions \( a \) or \( b \) must be even. This is because:

1. If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, any cut will result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions. When these two smaller rectangles are combined, they will always form a rectangle with the same dimensions as the original (or a 90-degree rotation of the original), which is not considered different.
2. If either \( a \) or \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with at least one even dimension. These smaller rectangles can then be combined to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The program checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`. If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes', indicating that Bob can form a different rectangle. If the condition is false, it prints 'No', indicating that Bob cannot form a different rectangle.

This logic correctly implements the solution to the problem based on the reasoning above.

Correctness: **True**
