Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where both dimensions of the rectangle are odd. According to the problem description, if both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" for such cases if one of the dimensions is 1. For example, for the input `1 3`, the program outputs "Yes" because `1 % 2 == 0` is false, but `3 % 2 == 0` is also false, so it should output "No". This is a clear violation of the problem description.
