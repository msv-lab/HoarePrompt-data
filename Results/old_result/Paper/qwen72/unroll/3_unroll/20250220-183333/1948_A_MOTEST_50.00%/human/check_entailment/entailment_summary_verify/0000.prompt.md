You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program:
import os
import string

def func():
    os.system('cls')
    s = string.ascii_uppercase
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            ans = ''
            x = 0
            if n % 2 == 0:
                for j in range(n // 2):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            else:
                (ans, x) = ('AAA', 1)
                for j in range(n // 2 - 1):
                    ans += s[x] * 2
                    x += 1
            print('YES')
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` does not return any value but performs the following actions: It first clears the console screen. It then reads an integer `t` from the user, representing the number of test cases. For each of the `t` test cases, it reads an integer `n` from the user. If `n` is 1, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. The string `ans` is constructed as follows: if `n` is even, it consists of the first `n // 2` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice (e.g., 'AABBCC' for `n = 6`). If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then continues with the first `n // 2 - 1` uppercase letters of the alphabet, each repeated twice (e.g., 'AAABBC' for `n = 5`). The function does not modify any external state beyond printing to the console.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the program should print "NO" because it is impossible to construct a string with exactly one special character. However, the current implementation prints "NO" for `n == 1` but does not terminate the function after printing "NO". Instead, it continues to execute the else block, which can lead to incorrect output. For example, if `n` is 1, the program will print:

```
NO
YES
A
```

This is incorrect because the program should only print "NO" and then move on to the next test case. The correct approach would be to add a `continue` statement after printing "NO" to skip the rest of the loop body.
