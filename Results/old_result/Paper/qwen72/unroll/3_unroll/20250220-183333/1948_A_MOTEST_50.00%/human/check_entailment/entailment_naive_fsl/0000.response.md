Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, if `n` is 1, the program should print "NO" because it is impossible to construct a string with exactly one special character. However, the current implementation prints "NO" for `n == 1` but does not terminate the function after printing "NO". Instead, it continues to execute the else block, which can lead to incorrect output. For example, if `n` is 1, the program will print:

```
NO
YES
A
```

This is incorrect because the program should only print "NO" and then move on to the next test case. The correct approach would be to add a `continue` statement after printing "NO" to skip the rest of the loop body.
