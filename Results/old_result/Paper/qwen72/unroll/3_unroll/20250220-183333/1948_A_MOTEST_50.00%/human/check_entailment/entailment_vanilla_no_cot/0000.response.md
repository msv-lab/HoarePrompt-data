Correctness: **True**

The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Case Handling**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have exactly one special character in a string where a special character is defined as being equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

3. **String Construction**:
   - For `n % 2 == 0` (even `n`):
     - The program constructs a string by repeating each letter from the alphabet twice until the string has `n` special characters. This ensures that each pair of repeated letters forms two special characters.
   - For `n % 2 != 0` (odd `n`):
     - The program starts with the string 'AAA' to handle the first three special characters (positions 1, 3, and 5).
     - It then continues to repeat each subsequent letter from the alphabet twice until the string has `n` special characters.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' followed by the constructed string if a valid string can be formed.
   - The program prints 'NO' if `n == 1`.

The program ensures that the string length does not exceed 200, which is a valid constraint as per the problem description. The logic for constructing the string is sound and meets the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
