The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, which ensures that `t` is at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 for the loop to start.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `i` is 0**
