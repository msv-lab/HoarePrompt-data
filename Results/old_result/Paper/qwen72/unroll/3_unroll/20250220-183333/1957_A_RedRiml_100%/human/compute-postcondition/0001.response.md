The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `w`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `w`. If `w` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `t`, `n`, and the list `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `w` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate, so it does not need to be explicitly stated in the state.

State: **`w` must be greater than 0**
