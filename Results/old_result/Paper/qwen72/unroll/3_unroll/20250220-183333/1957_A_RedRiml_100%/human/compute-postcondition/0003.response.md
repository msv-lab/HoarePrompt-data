The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The parameter `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and each `a_i` is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and a list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, where `t` and `n` are integers between 1 and 100, and each `a_i` is an integer between 1 and 100. The function returns a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not described.**
