Output State: **t, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n remain unchanged. w is reduced by the number of iterations the loop has executed.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `w` times, and each iteration reads input and processes it.
- The variables `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not modified within the loop, so they remain unchanged.
- The variable `w` is not explicitly modified within the loop, but the loop itself reduces the number of iterations left to execute by 1 for each iteration, so `w` is effectively reduced by the number of iterations the loop has executed.
- The variables `ln`, `palka`, `pl`, `d`, and `shapes` are local to each iteration of the loop and are reinitialized in each iteration, so they do not persist across iterations and do not affect the final state of the program outside the loop.
