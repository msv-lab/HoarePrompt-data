You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        pl = []
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
            if i not in pl:
                pl.append(i)
        shapes = 0
        for j in pl:
            if d[j] >= 3:
                shapes += d[j] // 3
        print(shapes)

def func():

    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())

            if i not in pl:

                shapes += d[j] // 3
        
        print(shapes)
        
    #State: t, n, a_1, a_2, ..., a_n remain unchanged. w is reduced by the number of iterations the loop has executed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`w`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`ln`) and the lengths of the sticks (`palka`).

2. **Frequency Count**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `d` to count the frequency of each stick length.
   - It also maintains a list `pl` to keep track of unique stick lengths.

3. **Shape Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the unique stick lengths in `pl`.
   - For each unique length, it checks if the frequency of that length (`d[j]`) is at least 3.
   - If the frequency is at least 3, it calculates the number of polygons that can be formed with that length by performing integer division (`d[j] // 3`).
   - It accumulates the total number of polygons in the variable `shapes`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total number of polygons for each test case.

### Issues:
- **Polygon Formation**:
  - The program assumes that any group of sticks with the same length can form a polygon if there are at least 3 sticks. However, this is not always correct. For example, 3 sticks of length 1 can form a triangle, but 4 sticks of length 1 can form a square, and 5 sticks of length 1 can form a pentagon.
  - The program should consider the maximum number of polygons that can be formed for each unique stick length, not just by dividing the count by 3.

### Correct Approach:
- For each unique stick length, the program should determine the maximum number of polygons that can be formed by dividing the count of that length by the number of sides of the polygon (which can be any integer greater than or equal to 3).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    w = int(input())
    for _ in range(w):
        ln = int(input())
        palka = list(map(int, input().split()))
        d = {}
        for i in palka:
            if d.get(i) == None:
                d[i] = 1
            else:
                d[i] += 1
        shapes = 0
        for j in d:
            for sides in range(3, d[j] + 1):
                shapes += d[j] // sides
                d[j] %= sides
        print(shapes)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Frequency Count**:
  - The dictionary `d` is used to count the frequency of each stick length.
- **Shape Calculation**:
  - For each unique stick length, the program iterates over possible polygon sides (from 3 to the frequency of that length).
  - It calculates the number of polygons that can be formed with that number of sides and updates the frequency of the stick length accordingly.
- **Output**:
  - The program prints the total number of polygons for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect because it only considers polygons with 3 sides, which is not the most optimal way to form polygons.
- The corrected program is more accurate as it considers all possible polygons that can be formed with the given stick lengths.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
