Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Cycles and Chains**:
   - The program checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` to determine if a friend and their best friend are the same. However, this condition is not sufficient to identify the correct number of invitations needed.
   - The problem requires identifying the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends come to the party. This involves understanding the structure of the friendship graph, which can be a combination of cycles and chains.

2. **Output for All Test Cases**:
   - The program only prints a single output for each test case, but it does not handle the different structures of the friendship graph correctly. It always prints either 2 or 3, which is not always the correct answer.

3. **Logic for Minimum Invitations**:
   - The correct approach involves identifying the smallest cycle or chain that can ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. If there is a cycle of length 2, Monocarp needs to send 2 invitations. If there is a cycle of length 3 or more, or a chain, Monocarp needs to send 3 invitations.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:

1. **Identify Cycles and Chains**:
   - Use a graph traversal technique (like DFS or BFS) to identify cycles and chains in the friendship graph.
   - If there is a cycle of length 2, the answer is 2.
   - If there is a cycle of length 3 or more, or a chain, the answer is 3.

2. **Handle Multiple Test Cases**:
   - Ensure the program processes each test case independently and correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def find_min_invitations(n, p):
    visited = [False] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle_length = 0
            j = i
            while not visited[j]:
                visited[j] = True
                j = p[j] - 1
                cycle_length += 1
            if cycle_length == 2:
                return 2
    return 3

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        print(find_min_invitations(n, p))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Graph Traversal**:
   - The function `find_min_invitations` uses a list `visited` to keep track of which friends have been visited.
   - It starts from each friend and follows the chain of best friends until it either finds a cycle or visits all friends in the chain.
   - If a cycle of length 2 is found, it returns 2.
   - If no cycle of length 2 is found, it returns 3.

2. **Handling Multiple Test Cases**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each one independently by calling `find_min_invitations`.

This corrected program will handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output for all test cases.
