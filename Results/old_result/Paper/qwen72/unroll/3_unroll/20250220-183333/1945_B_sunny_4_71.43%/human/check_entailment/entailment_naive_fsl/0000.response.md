Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the two installations launch fireworks at the same time. According to the problem description, the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously should account for the possibility that both installations might launch a firework at the same minute, which would increase the count by 2 instead of 1. However, the program simply calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and adds them together, without checking for overlaps.

For example, consider the input `a = 6`, `b = 7`, and `m = 42`. The first installation will launch fireworks at times `[6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42]`, and the second installation will launch fireworks at times `[7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42]`. Both installations launch a firework at time 42, which means there are 2 fireworks visible at the same time. However, the program will output `15` (7 from the first installation and 8 from the second), which is incorrect because it should account for the overlap at time 42.

The correct approach would involve calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the times when both installations launch fireworks simultaneously and adjust the count accordingly.
