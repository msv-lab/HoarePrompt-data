Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility duration `m` and then simply adds these numbers together. However, this approach does not account for the overlap in visibility times between fireworks launched by the two installations, which is crucial for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time.

To correctly solve the problem, you need to consider the visibility overlap and find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen at any given minute. The correct approach involves finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the overlap points and then calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible at any minute.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(x, y):
    return x * y // gcd(x, y)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = lcm(a, b)
        max_fireworks = 1 + (m + a) // a + (m + b) // b - (m + l) // l
        print(max_fireworks)

func()
```

Explanation:
1. **LCM Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` is calculated to find the points where both installations launch fireworks at the same time.
2. **Visibility Calculation**: The maximum number of fireworks visible at any minute is calculated by considering the visibility of fireworks launched by both installations and subtracting the overlap (where both installations launch a firework at the same time).

This corrected program should correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time for each test case.
