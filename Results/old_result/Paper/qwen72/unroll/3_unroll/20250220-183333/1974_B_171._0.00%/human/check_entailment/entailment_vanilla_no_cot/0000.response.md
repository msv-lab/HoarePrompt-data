Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. The program attempts to create a mapping from the alphabet to the characters in the encoded string, but it does not follow the symmetric replacement rule based on the auxiliary string `r` that consists of all distinct letters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.

Here is the correct approach to decode the string:

1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b` by collecting all distinct characters in alphabetical order.
2. Create a mapping where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r` (i.e., the first character maps to the last, the second to the second last, and so on).
3. Use this mapping to decode the string `b`.

The provided program instead tries to map each character in the encoded string to a character in the alphabet that has not been used yet, which does not follow the symmetric replacement rule and will produce incorrect results.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create the symmetric mapping
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)
```

This corrected program will correctly decode the string as specified in the problem statement.
