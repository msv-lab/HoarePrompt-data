Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. The issue lies in the logic of `func_1` where it attempts to create a mapping from the encoded characters to the original characters. The program incorrectly maps each character in the encoded string to a unique character from 'a' to 'z' that has not been used yet, rather than using the symmetric mapping based on the distinct characters in the encoded string.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```
The expected output is "codeforces". However, the program will output a different string because it does not correctly handle the symmetric mapping. The correct approach should involve constructing the auxiliary string `r` from the distinct characters in the encoded string and then using this string to perform the symmetric replacement.

Here is a corrected version of the function for reference:
```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Construct the auxiliary string r from distinct characters in alphabetical order
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Create a mapping from encoded characters to original characters
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Decode the string using the mapping
    decoded = [mapping[char] for char in encoded]
    
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected function would correctly decode the string "serofedsoc" to "codeforces". The original program fails to handle this and other similar cases correctly.
