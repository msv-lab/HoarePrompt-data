### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `string` and converts it to a list of characters `s`.

2. **Single Character String:**
   - If the length of the string `n` is 1, it prints 'NO' because a single character string is always a palindrome and cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. **First and Last Character Check:**
   - If the first and last characters of the string are different (`x != s[-1]`), the string is not a palindrome, and it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and the string itself.

4. **All Characters the Same:**
   - If all characters in the string are the same (`s.count(x) == n`), it prints 'NO' because any substring of a string with all identical characters is a palindrome.

5. **Almost All Characters the Same:**
   - If all but one character are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`), it checks if the string length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by 1 and the string itself.

6. **General Case:**
   - The function iterates through the string to find the first character that is different from the first character (`x`).
   - It then continues to find a second character that is different from `x`.
   - Based on the positions of these characters, it decides whether to print the string as a single non-palindromic substring or split it into two non-palindromic substrings.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where the string is a palindrome and where it is not a palindrome but needs to be split into non-palindromic parts.

8. **Output:**
   - For each test case, the function prints 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the appropriate partition details.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The function correctly identifies and handles single character strings.
- It correctly identifies strings where the first and last characters are different and prints the string as a single non-palindromic substring.
- It correctly identifies strings where all characters are the same and prints 'NO'.
- It correctly identifies strings where all but one character are the same and handles the odd-length string case.
- The general case logic for finding and splitting the string into non-palindromic substrings is complex but seems to cover most cases.

However, there is a potential issue in the general case logic:
- The logic for splitting the string into two non-palindromic substrings is overly complicated and may not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, if the string is "abab" (which is not a palindrome), the function might not correctly split it into non-palindromic parts.

### Correctness:
Given the complexity and potential edge case issues in the general case logic, the function is not guaranteed to be correct for all inputs.

**Correctness: False**
