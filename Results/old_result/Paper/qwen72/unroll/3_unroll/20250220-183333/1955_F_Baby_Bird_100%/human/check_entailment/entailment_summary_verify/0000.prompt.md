You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
def func():
    print('\n'.join([str(sum((3 * (x // 2) + x % 2 * (i < 3) for (i, x) in enumerate(map(int, input().split())))) // 3) for _ in range(int(input()))]))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers `p_i` (where \(0 \leq p_i \leq 200\)) from the input. It then calculates a value for each test case based on a specific formula and prints the result of this calculation for each test case, each result being the sum of a modified sequence of the input integers divided by 3. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.

The core logic of the program is:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the counts of the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
3. It calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by using the formula:
   \[
   \text{max\_wins} = \left\lfloor \frac{\sum (3 \times \left\lfloor \frac{x}{2} \right\rfloor + (x \mod 2) \times (i < 3))}{3} \right\rfloor
   \]
   where \( x \) is the count of each number (1, 2, 3, 4) and \( i \) is the index of the number (0 for 1, 1 for 2, 2 for 3, 3 for 4).

This formula works because:
- Each pair of the same number (1, 2, 3, or 4) can be removed without changing the XOR result.
- If there is an odd count of a number, removing one of them can potentially change the XOR result to zero, which is a win for Bob.
- The formula ensures that the maximum number of such pairs and odd counts are considered to maximize Bob's wins.

The program correctly handles all edge cases and inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
