The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and the context, it can be inferred that the function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts four integers `p_i` where each `p_i` is between 0 and 200. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, but it likely returns some result based on the input parameters for each test case.

Given the constraints and the lack of explicit return values in the provided information, the functionality of the function `func` can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts four integers `p_i` (0 <= p_i <= 200). The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
