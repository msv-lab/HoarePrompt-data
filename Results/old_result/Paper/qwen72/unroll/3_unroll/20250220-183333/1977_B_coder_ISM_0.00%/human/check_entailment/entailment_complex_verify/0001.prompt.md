You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

    #State: After the loop executes all iterations, `x` will be the last input integer provided, `t` will remain the same as the initial input integer, and `s` will be a list of characters representing the modified binary form of `x` with a length that may be 30 or 31 depending on the final value of `x` and the operations performed. The list `s` will contain '0', '1', and possibly '-1' characters, and the variable `length` will be the length of the list `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (1 ≤ x < 2^30) and converts it into a binary string of length 30. It then modifies this binary string according to specific rules: if two consecutive '1's are found, the first '1' is replaced with '-1', and a flag is set. If the flag is set and a '0' is found, the '0' is replaced with '1', and the flag is reset. If the flag is still set after the loop, the last character of the list is modified, and an additional '1' may be appended, increasing the length to 31. The function prints the modified binary string, the length of the modified string, and the final modified string for each test case. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. This is correct and aligns with the problem's input format.

2. **Binary Representation**: For each test case, the program initializes an array `s` with 30 elements, all set to '0'. It then iterates through the bits of `x` (from 0 to 29) and sets the corresponding element in `s` to '1' if the bit is set in `x`. This step correctly converts the integer `x` into its binary representation.

3. **Adjusting for Constraints**: The program then attempts to adjust the array `s` to meet the constraint that no two consecutive elements can be non-zero. It uses a `flag` to track when a '1' is converted to '-1' and needs to be compensated for in subsequent bits.

4. **Compensation Logic**:
   - If `flag` is set and the current bit is '0', it changes the bit to '1' and resets the `flag`.
   - If `flag` is not set and the current bit and the next bit are both '1', it changes the current bit to '-1' and sets the `flag` to 1.
   - If `flag` is set and the current bit is '1', it changes the current bit to '0'.
   - If the `flag` is set at the end of the loop and the last bit is '0', it changes the last bit to '1'.
   - If the `flag` is still set after the last bit, it changes the last bit to '0' and appends a '1' to the array, increasing the length by 1.

5. **Final Adjustments**: The program makes a final pass to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero by checking if a '-1' is followed by a '1' and adjusting accordingly.

6. **Output**: The program prints the length of the array `s` and the array itself. This is correct and aligns with the problem's output format.

However, there are a few issues in the logic that need to be addressed:

- **Incorrect Final Adjustment**: The final adjustment loop is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results. The adjustment should be done in a single pass to ensure that no two consecutive elements are non-zero.
- **Handling of `flag`**: The `flag` logic is not correctly implemented. It should ensure that when a '1' is converted to '-1', the next bit is set to '1' if it is '0'. If the next bit is also '1', the `flag` should be set to 1 to propagate the adjustment.

Given these issues, the program is not correct as it stands. The logic for handling the `flag` and ensuring no two consecutive non-zero elements is flawed.
