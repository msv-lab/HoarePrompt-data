To determine what will be printed by the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **`ans`**: This variable holds the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between `left` and `D[l] + f`, and `right` and `D[l] + f` for all `f` in `F`. This means `ans` is the smallest value that can be obtained from the maximum differences calculated for each `f` in `F`.

2. **`next_max_diff`**: This variable is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it must be a value that is relevant to the context of the problem. It is likely another maximum difference that is being compared to `ans`.

3. **`D[l]`**: This is an element from the list `D` at index `l`. The list `D` and the index `l` are not explicitly defined, but they are part of the calculation.

4. **`F`**: This is a list of values, and `f` is an element from this list.

5. **`left` and `right`**: These variables are not explicitly defined in the initial state, but they are part of the calculation of the differences.

Given the initial state, the `print(max(ans, next_max_diff))` statement will print the maximum value between `ans` and `next_max_diff`.

Since the exact values of `left`, `right`, `D`, `F`, and `next_max_diff` are not provided, we can only describe the output in terms of these variables.

Output: **max(ans, next_max_diff) (where `ans` is the minimum possible value of the maximum difference between `left` and `D[l] + f`, and `right` and `D[l] + f` for all `f` in `F`, and `next_max_diff` is another maximum difference value)**
