The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `testcases`. For the loop to execute, `testcases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `testcases` is greater than 0.

State: **`testcases` is the result of `func_3()` execution and must be greater than 0, `_` is a placeholder and not affected**
