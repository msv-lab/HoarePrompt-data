Output State: **The function `q` is defined as a lambda function that prints a query of the form "? d" where `d` is an integer, and then reads and maps the input to integers. The graph and its properties, the number of test cases `t`, and the number of vertices `n` in each test case remain unchanged.**

This means that the function `q` is now available for use to query the graph, and it will print the query and read the response as a list of integers. The initial conditions of the graph, the number of test cases, and the number of vertices in each test case are still valid and unchanged.
