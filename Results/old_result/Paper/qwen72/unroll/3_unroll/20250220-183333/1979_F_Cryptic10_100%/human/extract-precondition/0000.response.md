Precondition: **The function operates in an interactive environment where the graph is modified based on queries. The graph is initially a complete undirected graph with n vertices, from which exactly (n - 2) edges have been removed. The function can make up to n queries of the form "? d" where d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= n - 1. The function must output a Hamiltonian path in the form "! v_1 v_2 ... v_n" where v_i are the vertices in the order of their occurrence in the path. The function must handle multiple test cases, with the number of test cases t satisfying 1 <= t <= 1000, and the number of vertices n in each test case satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
