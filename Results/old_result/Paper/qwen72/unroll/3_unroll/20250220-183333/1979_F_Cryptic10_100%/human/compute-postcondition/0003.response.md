Output State: **The loop has processed all test cases. For each test case, it has printed the final sequence of vertices in the format "! vertex1 vertex2 ...", where the vertices are ordered such that any vertex v1 that has a direct edge to v2 (as determined by the queries) appears before v2 in the sequence. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the function `q` continues to perform the same operations as initially defined.**
