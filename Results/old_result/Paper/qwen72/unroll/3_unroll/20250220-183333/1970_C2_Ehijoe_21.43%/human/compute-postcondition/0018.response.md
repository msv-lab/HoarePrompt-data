Functionality: ** The function reads the number of nodes `n` and a fixed integer `t` (set to 1) from input. It then reads `n-1` pairs of integers representing the edges of a tree and constructs an adjacency list `nodes` for the tree. The function identifies all leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one connection) and stores them in a deque `leaves`. It reads a starting node `start` from input and calls another function `func_1` with the adjacency list `nodes` and the starting node `start`. The function prints 'Ron' if at least one move in the result of `func_1` is an odd number, otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'. The function does not return any value. **
