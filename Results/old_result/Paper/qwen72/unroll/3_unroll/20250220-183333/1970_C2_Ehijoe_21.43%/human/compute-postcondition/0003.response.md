Output State: **`n` and `t` are integers provided by the user input, where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and `t` = 1. The edges list is an empty list. `start` is an integer where 1 <= `start` <= `n`, representing the starting node for the game. `empty` is True. `nodes` is a defaultdict with list as the default factory.**

The code initializes `nodes` as a `defaultdict` with `list` as the default factory. This means that `nodes` will automatically create a new empty list for any key that is accessed but does not yet exist in the dictionary. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
