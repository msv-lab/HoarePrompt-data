Postcondition: **The `leaves` deque is populated with all the nodes that have exactly one connection in the graph. The `nodes` defaultdict remains unchanged. The `edges` list remains empty. The `empty` variable remains True. The `start` variable is an input integer. The loop has iterated `n-1` times, and `t` remains 1. `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, and at least one element in `moves` is an odd number.**
