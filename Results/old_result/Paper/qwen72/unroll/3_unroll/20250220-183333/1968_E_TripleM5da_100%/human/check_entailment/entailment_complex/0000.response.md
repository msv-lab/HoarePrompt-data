Reasoning:  
The program aims to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which contains the distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. The program prints a specific set of points for each test case. Let's analyze the correctness of the program based on the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and the value of \(n\) for each test case. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints \(n\) points for each test case, which is correct according to the problem requirements.

3. **Points Selection**:
   - For \(n = 2\), the program prints the points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\). The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1\}\), which has a size of 2. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 2\).
   - For \(n = 3\), the program prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((3, 3)\). The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4. This is the maximum possible size for \(n = 3\).
   - For \(n \geq 4\), the program prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and for each \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints \((i, i)\).

4. **Maximizing \(\mathcal{H}\)**:
   - The points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) ensure that the distances 0 and 1 are included in \(\mathcal{H}\).
   - The points \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\) ensure that the distances \(2, 3, \ldots, 2(n-2)\) are included in \(\mathcal{H}\). This is because the distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((i, i)\) is \(2(i-1)\), and the distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((i, i)\) is \(2(i-1) - 1\).

However, the program does not consider the possibility of including points that could potentially increase the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) further. For example, for \(n = 4\), the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), and \((4, 4)\) would yield a set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), which has a size of 6. The program's current approach only yields a set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\) for \(n = 5\) and \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}\) for \(n = 6\), but it does not necessarily maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Therefore, the program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) as required by the problem.

Correctness: **False**
