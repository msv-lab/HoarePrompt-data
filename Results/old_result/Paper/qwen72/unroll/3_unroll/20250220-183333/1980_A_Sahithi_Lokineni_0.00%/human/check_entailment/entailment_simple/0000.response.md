### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `s` which contains the difficulty levels of the problems.

2. **Counting Problem Frequencies:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Minimum Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It iterates over the keys in the `defaultdict` and checks if the count of each difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If the count is less than `m`, it calculates the difference `m - d[val]` and adds this to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

5. **Issues:**
   - The `defaultdict` is initialized with `default_value`, which is not defined in the program. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run.
   - The program should initialize the `defaultdict` with a default value of 0, which can be done using `defaultdict(int)`.

6. **Corrected Code:**
   - The corrected code should use `defaultdict(int)` to initialize the dictionary with a default value of 0.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Corrected initialization
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] += 1
    ans = 0
    for val in 'ABCDEFG':  # Ensure all difficulty levels are checked
        if d[val] < m:
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **`defaultdict(int)`**: This ensures that any key that is not already in the dictionary will have a default value of 0.
- **Iterating over 'ABCDEFG'**: This ensures that the program checks for the presence of each difficulty level, even if it does not appear in the input string.

### Final Correctness:
- The original program is incorrect due to the `NameError` caused by the undefined `default_value`.
- The corrected program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False** (due to the `NameError` in the original program)
