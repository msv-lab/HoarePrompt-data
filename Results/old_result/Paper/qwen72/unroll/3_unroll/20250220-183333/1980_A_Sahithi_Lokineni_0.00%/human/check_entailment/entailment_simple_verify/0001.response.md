### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n` and the number of rounds `m`.
   - It then reads the string `s` which represents the difficulties of the problems.

2. **Problem Counting:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
   - This is done using the loop `for i in range(n): d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1`.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Problems Needed:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the total number of additional problems needed.
   - It then iterates over the keys in the dictionary `d` (which are the difficulty levels).
   - For each difficulty level, it checks if the count of that difficulty level is less than or equal to `m`.
   - If so, it calculates the number of additional problems needed for that difficulty level by `m - d[val]` and adds this to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

5. **Issues:**
   - **Undefined `default_value`:** The program uses `default_value` in the `defaultdict` initialization, but `default_value` is not defined. This will cause a `NameError` when the program is run. The correct initialization should be `defaultdict(int)` or `defaultdict(lambda: 0)`.
   - **Incorrect Comparison:** The condition `if d[val] <= m` is incorrect. If the count of a difficulty level is exactly `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level. The correct condition should be `if d[val] < m`.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined but never used. This is unnecessary and can be removed to clean up the code.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    d = defaultdict(int)  # Corrected to use int as the default value
    (n, m) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    for i in range(n):
        d[s[i]] = d[s[i]] + 1
    ans = 0
    for val in d.keys():
        if d[val] < m:  # Corrected to use < instead of <=
            ans += m - d[val]
    print(ans)
```

### Explanation of the Fix:
- **Default Value for `defaultdict`:** The `defaultdict` should be initialized with `int` or `lambda: 0` to ensure that the default value for any key is 0.
- **Comparison in the Loop:** The condition `if d[val] < m` is more appropriate than `if d[val] <= m` because if the count of a difficulty level is exactly `m`, no additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is corrected as shown above.
- **False** if the program is left as is due to the undefined `default_value` and the incorrect comparison `<=`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False** (due to the issues mentioned, but can be corrected as shown)
