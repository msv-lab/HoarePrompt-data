Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem as described:

1. **Indexing Error in Conditions**: The conditions involving `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` are incorrect. The width `w` is stored at `clues[1]`, but the program incorrectly uses it in conditions that should be based on the column positions of Alice and Bob.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Column Differences**: The program incorrectly calculates the column differences and their absolute values. The logic for determining whether Alice or Bob can win based on the column differences is flawed.

3. **Simplified Logic**: The problem can be simplified by considering the relative positions of Alice and Bob and the number of moves required to potentially meet. The program's logic is overly complex and contains several unnecessary conditions.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the number of moves Alice and Bob can make
        moves_a = h - x_a
        moves_b = x_b - 1
        
        # If Alice and Bob are in the same column and the number of moves is the same, Alice wins
        if y_a == y_b and moves_a == moves_b:
            answers.append('Alice')
        # If the number of moves is the same but they are not in the same column, it's a draw
        elif moves_a == moves_b:
            answers.append('Draw')
        # If Alice can make more moves than Bob, Alice wins
        elif moves_a > moves_b:
            answers.append('Alice')
        # If Bob can make more moves than Alice, Bob wins
        else:
            answers.append('Bob')
    
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version simplifies the logic by focusing on the number of moves each player can make and their relative positions. It correctly handles the conditions for Alice winning, Bob winning, and a draw.
