Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, the list `xx` will contain `n + 1` strings, where the first string is an empty string and the remaining `n` strings are the input strings provided. The list `a` will contain the counts of 'F' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix, and the list `b` will contain the counts of 'S' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix. The initial state of `n` remains unchanged. The list `sa` is now an empty list.**
