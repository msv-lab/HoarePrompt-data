The function `func` accepts a list of strings as its parameter. The list contains `n` strings, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. Each string in the list is of length `n` and consists of characters 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'. The input list forms a symmetric matrix, meaning the character at the i-th row and j-th column is the same as the character at the j-th row and i-th column for all i and j. The diagonal characters (i.e., where i = j) are always '.'. At most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided, meaning at most \(2 \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'.

The function returns a modified version of the input list, where the '?' characters are replaced with 'F' or 'S' to complete the transition video assignments while maintaining the symmetry and the constraints on the number of decided transitions.
