Output State: The list `xx` remains unchanged. The list `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The list `sa` remains unchanged. The list `sb` will contain the indices of rows (and columns) where there is at least one 'S' character and no 'F' characters, as well as the indices of rows (and columns) where there are no 'F' characters and no 'S' characters. The length of `sa` is still less than the length of `sb`.
