Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup**:
   - The program reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing the transition videos between scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists, `a` and `b`, to count the number of 'F' and 'S' characters for each row (and column) of the input matrix.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an empty string as the first element to align indices with the problem's 1-based indexing.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S' Characters**:
   - The program iterates through each row and column of the input matrix, updating the counts in `a` and `b` for 'F' and 'S' characters, respectively.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` correctly reflect the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions involving the i-th scenario.

3. **Identifying Rows/Columns with Only 'F' or Only 'S'**:
   - The program then identifies rows (and columns) where there are only 'F' characters (`sa`) or only 'S' characters (`sb`).
   - This step helps in determining which scenarios are already biased towards 'F' or 'S'.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions**:
   - If the length of `sa` (rows with only 'F') is greater than or equal to the length of `sb` (rows with only 'S'), the program appends rows with no 'F' or 'S' to `sa`.
   - Otherwise, it appends rows with no 'F' or 'S' to `sb`.

5. **Replacing '?' Characters**:
   - The program then iterates through the input matrix again, replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the following logic:
     - If the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sa` (or `sb`), it replaces '?' with 'F' (or 'S').
     - Otherwise, it replaces '?' with 'S' (or 'F').

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the modified matrix, ensuring that the transition videos meet the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

**Potential Issues**:
- **Indexing Error**: The program uses `n // 4 - 1` to determine the first quarter of `sa` or `sb`. This could lead to an index out of range error if `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`), as `n // 4 - 1` would be negative or zero.
- **Symmetry Constraint**: The program does not explicitly ensure that the matrix remains symmetric after replacing '?' characters. This could lead to inconsistencies where `xx[i][j]` and `xx[j][i]` are not the same.

**Correctness**:
- The program's logic is generally sound, but the indexing issue and the lack of explicit symmetry enforcement are critical flaws that could lead to incorrect results.

Given these issues, the program is not guaranteed to produce a correct solution for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**
