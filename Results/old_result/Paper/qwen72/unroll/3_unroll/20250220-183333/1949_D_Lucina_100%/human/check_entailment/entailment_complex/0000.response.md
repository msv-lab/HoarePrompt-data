Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, where the characters are either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.'.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the counts of 'F' and 'S' characters for each row (and column).
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input strings, with an extra empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S' Characters**:
   - The function iterates through the input strings and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each 'F' and 'S' character found.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` correctly represent the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in the i-th row (and column).

3. **Identifying Rows with Only 'F' or Only 'S'**:
   - The function then identifies rows (and columns) that have at least one 'F' character and no 'S' characters, storing their indices in `sa`.
   - Similarly, it identifies rows (and columns) that have at least one 'S' character and no 'F' characters, storing their indices in `sb`.

4. **Handling Undecided Transitions**:
   - If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the function appends indices of rows with no 'F' or 'S' characters to `sa`.
   - It then iterates through the input matrix and replaces '?' characters with 'F' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sa`, and with 'S' otherwise.
   - If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, the function appends indices of rows with no 'F' or 'S' characters to `sb`.
   - It then iterates through the input matrix and replaces '?' characters with 'S' if the row or column index is in the first quarter of `sb`, and with 'F' otherwise.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the modified matrix, ensuring that the transition videos do not have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

**Key Issues**:
- **Consecutive Videos Constraint**: The function attempts to replace '?' characters in such a way that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown. However, the logic for replacing '?' characters is flawed. The function only considers the first quarter of `sa` or `sb` for replacement, which may not be sufficient to ensure the constraint is met for all permutations of scenarios.
- **Symmetry**: The function does not explicitly ensure that the matrix remains symmetric after replacing '?' characters. This is crucial because the transition videos are specific to pairs of scenarios, and the matrix should reflect this symmetry.

**Conclusion**:
- The function does not correctly handle the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for all permutations of scenarios.
- The function does not ensure the symmetry of the matrix after replacing '?' characters.

Correctness: **False**
