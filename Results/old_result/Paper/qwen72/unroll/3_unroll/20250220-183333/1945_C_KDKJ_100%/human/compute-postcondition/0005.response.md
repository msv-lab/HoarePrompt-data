Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `S` is a list containing `len(a) + 1` sublists, where each sublist `[x, y]` represents the cumulative count of '0's and non-'0's encountered in the string `a` up to that point, starting from the initial sublist `[0, 0]`. The final sublist in `S` will contain the total count of '0's and non-'0's in the string `a`. `ans` is -1.**
