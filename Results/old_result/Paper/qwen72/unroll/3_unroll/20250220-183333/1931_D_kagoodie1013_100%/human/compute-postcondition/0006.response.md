Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a`. The function returns a list `results` where each element corresponds to the count of pairs `(i, j)` in the respective test case such that `0 â‰¤ i < j < n` and the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by both `x` and `y`. The input `test_cases` remains unchanged after the function execution. **
