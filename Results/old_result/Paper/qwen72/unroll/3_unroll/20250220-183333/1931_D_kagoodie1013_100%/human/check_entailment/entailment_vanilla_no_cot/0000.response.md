Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads all input at once and processes it into test cases, which is efficient for large inputs as described in the problem constraints.

2. **Residue Calculation**: For each number in the array, it calculates the residues `r_x` and `r_y` for the conditions:
   - `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`
   - `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`

   The residues are calculated as:
   - `r_x = -num % x` (which is equivalent to the residue of `-num` modulo `x`)
   - `r_y = num % y` (which is the residue of `num` modulo `y`)

3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: The program uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions. For each number `num` in the array, it checks if there is a previously seen number with the same residues `(r_x, r_y)` and increments the count accordingly. This ensures that the pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is beautiful if both conditions are met.

4. **Updating the Dictionary**: After checking for beautiful pairs, it updates the dictionary with the current number's residues, ensuring that future numbers can be checked against these residues.

5. **Output**: The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them, which matches the expected output format.

The logic and implementation are sound and should work correctly for the given problem constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
