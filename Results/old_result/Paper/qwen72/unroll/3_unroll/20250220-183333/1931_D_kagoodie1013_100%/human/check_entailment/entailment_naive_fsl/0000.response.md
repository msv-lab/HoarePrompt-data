Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It uses a dictionary (`residue_map`) to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`. For each element in the array, it calculates the required residues (`r_x` and `r_y`) that would form a beautiful pair with the current element, and then it checks if these residues are already in the dictionary. If they are, it adds the count of such pairs to the total count. Finally, it updates the dictionary with the current element's residues.

The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases, such as:
- Empty arrays (though the problem guarantees at least 2 elements).
- Different values of `x` and `y`.
- Large arrays and multiple test cases.

The logic is sound and follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
