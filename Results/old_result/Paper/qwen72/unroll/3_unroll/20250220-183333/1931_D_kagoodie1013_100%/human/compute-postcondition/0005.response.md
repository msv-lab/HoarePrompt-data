The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

After executing the function, it returns a list `results` which contains the number of pairs `(i, j)` for each test case, where `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `a_i + a_j` is divisible by both `x` and `y`. The input `test_cases` remains unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of test cases, each containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list `a`. It returns a list `results` where each element is the count of pairs `(i, j)` in the corresponding test case such that `0 ≤ i < j < n` and `a_i + a_j` is divisible by both `x` and `y`.**
