### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (n, x, y, and the array `arr`).

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program initializes a `count` variable to zero, which will store the number of beautiful pairs.
   - It also initializes a `residue_map` dictionary to keep track of the residues of the array elements modulo `x` and `y`.

3. **Residue Calculation**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `arr`, the program calculates two residues:
     - `r_x` is the residue of `-num` modulo `x`.
     - `r_y` is the residue of `num` modulo `y`.
   - The program then checks if the tuple `(r_x, r_y)` exists in the `residue_map`. If it does, it adds the count of such tuples to the `count` variable.

4. **Updating Residue Map**:
   - The program calculates the current key as `(num % x, num % y)` and updates the `residue_map` with this key, incrementing its count.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, the program appends the `count` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of Residue Calculation**:
  - The calculation of `r_x` as `-num % x` is correct because it ensures that the sum `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x`.
  - The calculation of `r_y` as `num % y` is correct because it ensures that the difference `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`.

- **Correctness of Counting**:
  - The program correctly counts the number of pairs \((i, j)\) where \(1 \le i < j \le n\) and both conditions are satisfied by using the `residue_map`.

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program uses a dictionary to store the residues, which allows for efficient lookups and updates. This is crucial for handling large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge case where the array has only two elements correctly.
  - It also handles the case where there are no beautiful pairs correctly by initializing `count` to zero and not incrementing it if no valid pairs are found.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array for each test case. It efficiently processes the input and handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
