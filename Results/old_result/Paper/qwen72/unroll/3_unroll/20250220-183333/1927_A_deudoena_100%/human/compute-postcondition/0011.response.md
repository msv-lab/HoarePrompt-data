Functionality: ** The function `func_1` reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the input. It then calculates the positions of the first and last occurrences of the character 'B' in the string `s`. The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B', plus 2. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `test_cases` mentioned in the comments. **
