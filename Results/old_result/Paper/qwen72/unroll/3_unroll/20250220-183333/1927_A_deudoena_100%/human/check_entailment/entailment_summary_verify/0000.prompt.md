You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` reads an integer `m` and a string `s` from the input. It then calculates the positions of the first and last occurrences of the character 'B' in the string `s`. The function returns the difference between the position of the last 'B' and the position of the first 'B', plus 2. The function does not use the parameters `t` and `test_cases` mentioned in the comments.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the entire strip is already white. According to the problem description, it is guaranteed that at least one cell is black, but the program does not check for this condition. If the input string `s` is "WWWW" (for example), the program will return an incorrect result because it will not find any 'B' and will return `ma - mi + 2`, which is not defined correctly in this context.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the black cells are at the very beginning or end of the strip. For example, if the input string is "BWWWW", the program will return 2, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 1, as only the first cell needs to be painted white.

Finally, the program does not correctly handle the case where there are no black cells between the first and last black cells. For example, if the input string is "BWWWWB", the program will return 2, which is incorrect. The correct answer should be 6, as the entire strip needs to be painted white to cover all black cells.
