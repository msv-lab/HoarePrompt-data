Output State: **The loop will have executed `n_cases` times, and for each test case, it will have printed either `1` if `n` is `1`, or `2 ** power` where `power` is the largest integer such that `2 ** power` is less than or equal to `n`. The variable `i` will have the value `n_cases` (the number of test cases), and the variable `power` will have the value of the last computed power for the final test case. The variable `n` will hold the value of the last input integer for the final test case.**
