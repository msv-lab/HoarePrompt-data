### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `n_cases` from the standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).

2. **Handling the Base Case:**
   - If `n` is 1, the array is `[1]` and no operations are performed. Therefore, the position of 1 is 1, which is correctly printed.

3. **Finding the Largest Power of 2 Less Than or Equal to `n`:**
   - For `n` greater than 1, the function calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - The variable `power` is initialized to 1 and incremented until it is greater than or equal to `log2(n)`.
   - If `power` is exactly equal to `log2(n)`, it means `n` is a power of 2, and the function prints `2 ** power`.
   - If `power` is not exactly equal to `log2(n)`, it means `n` is not a power of 2, and the function prints `2 ** (power - 1)`.

4. **Understanding the Swap Operation:**
   - The swap operation \(\texttt{swap}(k)\) swaps the elements at positions `d` and `k`, where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` other than `k` itself.
   - For any `k` that is not a power of 2, the largest divisor `d` will be less than `k` and will be a power of 2.
   - For `k` that is a power of 2, the largest divisor `d` will be `k / 2`.

5. **Effect of the Swap Operations:**
   - When performing \(\texttt{swap}(i)\) for each \(i\) from 2 to `n`, the element at position 1 (initially 1) will be swapped to the position of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.
   - This is because the largest power of 2 will eventually be the position where 1 ends up after all the swaps.

6. **Output:**
   - The function correctly prints the position of 1 in the resulting array after performing the swap operations for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The function `func` correctly implements the logic to determine the position of 1 in the array after performing the specified swap operations. The logic for handling the base case and the general case is sound and aligns with the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
