### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit in this case is `n * a`, which is correctly calculated and printed.

   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each step.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence is:
       \[
       S_n = \frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2}
       \]
     - This is correctly implemented in the program as `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.

   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each step.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `b - a` terms is:
       \[
       S_{b-a} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}
       \]
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is:
       \[
       (n - (b - a)) \times a
       \]
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts:
       \[
       \text{Total Profit} = S_{b-a} + (n - (b - a)) \times a
       \]
     - However, the implementation in the program is incorrect. The formula used is:
       \[
       \text{Total Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n
       \]
     - This formula does not correctly account for the remaining buns being sold at the usual price `a`. The correct formula should be:
       \[
       \text{Total Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times (n - (b - a))
       \]

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the first two cases as described in the problem.
- The third case is incorrectly implemented, leading to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
