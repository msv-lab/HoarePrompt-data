### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Conditions and Calculations:**
   - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
     - If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a` because the modified price does not offer any advantage.
     - The profit in this case is simply `n * a`.

   - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell all buns at the modified price.
     - The profit in this case is the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each step.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic sequence is:
       \[
       S_n = \frac{n \times (2b - n + 1)}{2}
       \]
     - This is correctly implemented in the program as `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.

   - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
     - If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is less than the number of buns `n`, Bob should sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns at the usual price `a`.
     - The profit from the first `b - a` buns is the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from `b` and decreasing by 1 each step.
     - The formula for the sum of the first `b - a` terms is:
       \[
       S_{b-a} = \frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2}
       \]
     - The profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns is:
       \[
       (n - (b - a)) \times a
       \]
     - The total profit is the sum of these two parts:
       \[
       \text{Total Profit} = S_{b-a} + (n - (b - a)) \times a
       \]
     - This is correctly implemented in the program as `int((b - a) * (b - a + 1) // 2 + a * n)`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles all three cases as described in the problem.
- The arithmetic calculations are correct and match the formulas derived from the problem description.
- The program uses integer division (`//`) to ensure the result is an integer, which is appropriate given the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
