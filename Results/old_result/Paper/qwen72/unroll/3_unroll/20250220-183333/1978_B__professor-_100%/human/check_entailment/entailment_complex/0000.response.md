Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case. This matches the problem description.

2. **Conditions**:
   - **Case 1**: `if b <= a:`  
     If the modified price `b` is less than or equal to the usual price `a`, it is optimal to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. The function correctly prints `n * a` in this case.
   - **Case 2**: `elif b - a >= n:`  
     If the difference between the modified price `b` and the usual price `a` is greater than or equal to the number of buns `n`, Bob can sell all buns at the modified price. The function correctly calculates the sum of the first `n` terms of an arithmetic series starting from `b` and prints `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n // 2)`.
   - **Case 3**: `else:`  
     If neither of the above conditions is met, Bob can only sell the first `b - a` buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price. The function correctly calculates the profit for the first `b - a` buns using the formula for the sum of the first `b - a` terms of an arithmetic series and adds the profit from the remaining `n - (b - a)` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Output**: The function prints the correct profit for each test case based on the conditions described.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `b` is less than or equal to `a` by selling all buns at the usual price.
   - It also handles the case where `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n` by selling all buns at the modified price.
   - For other cases, it correctly calculates the profit by combining the modified and usual prices.

5. **Performance**: The function uses simple arithmetic operations and conditions, which are efficient and suitable for the given constraints (1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Given the above reasoning, the function appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
