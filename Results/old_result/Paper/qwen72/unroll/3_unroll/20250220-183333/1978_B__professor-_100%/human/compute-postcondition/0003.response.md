The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature, but based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function accepts multiple parameters. Specifically, it accepts an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` where 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9. The function returns different values based on the input:

- Case_1: If `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that 1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9, the function processes each test case and returns a result for each one.

Since the specific output for each test case is not provided, we can only infer that the function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`. It processes each test case and returns a result for each one.**
