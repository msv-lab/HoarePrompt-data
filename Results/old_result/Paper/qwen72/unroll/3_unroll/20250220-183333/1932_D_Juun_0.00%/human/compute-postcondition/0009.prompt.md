Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: After the loop executes all iterations, the variable `trumps` will contain the ranks of all cards that have the `trump_suit`. The `suits` dictionary will have `None` for all suits that had a trump card played, and the last non-trump card rank for any suit that did not have a trump card played. The `answers` list will contain strings representing pairs of cards (in sorted order by rank) for each suit where two non-trump cards were played, formatted as "rank1 suit rank2 suit".
Code of the loop:
for suit, rank in suits.items():
    if rank is None:
        continue
    if trumps != []:
        answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
    else:
        print('IMPOSSIBLE')
        return


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
