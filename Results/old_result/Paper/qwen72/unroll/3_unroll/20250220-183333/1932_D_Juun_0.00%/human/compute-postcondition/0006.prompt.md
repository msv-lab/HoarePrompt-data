Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The function should accept three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump_suit` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n cards `cards` (each card is a two-character string where the first character is the rank, one of "23456789", and the second character is the suit, one of "CDHS", and all cards are unique). The input has been read, but the variables `n` and `cards` are not yet assigned specific values. `trump_suit` is now assigned the value of the input, which is one of "CDHS". `trumps` is an empty list. `answers` is an empty list. `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and all values set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
for card in input().split():
    rank, suit = card
    if suit == trump:
        trumps.append(rank)
    elif suits[suit] is not None:
        answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit],
            rank])]))
        suits[suit] = None
    else:
        suits[suit] = rank


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
