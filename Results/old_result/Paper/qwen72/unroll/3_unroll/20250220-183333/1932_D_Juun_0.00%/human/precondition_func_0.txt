The function should accept three parameters: the number of rounds `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), the trump suit `trump_suit` (one of "CDHS"), and a list of 2n cards `cards` (each card is a two-character string where the first character is the rank, one of "23456789", and the second character is the suit, one of "CDHS", and all cards are unique). The function should return a list of n pairs of cards, where each pair represents a valid round, or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no such sequence can be reconstructed.
