Precondition: **The function `func_1` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description indicates that the function should handle multiple test cases, each with an array `c` of length `n` and `q` queries. The actual function should take parameters for the number of test cases, the array `c`, and the queries. Each element of `c` is a positive integer, and each query is a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` where `1 <= l_i <= r_i <= n`. The function should be defined to accept these inputs.**

Given the discrepancy between the function definition and the problem description, the correct function definition should be:
```
def func_1(t, n, c, q, queries):
```

Here, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the array `c`, `c` is the array itself, `q` is the number of queries, and `queries` is a list of pairs `[l_i, r_i]` representing the queries.
