### Reasoning:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop to process each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called without any arguments, which is correct because the function reads the input directly from `stdin`.

2. **Array `a` and `b` Initialization:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with an extra leading zero to handle 1-based indexing.
   - The array `b` is initialized with zeros and then populated with cumulative sums of 1 or 2 based on the condition `a[i] > 1`. This is done to ensure that `b[i]` is always different from `a[i]` and is positive.

3. **Cumulative Sum Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the cumulative sum of `a` using the `accumulate` function from `itertools`.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the sum of the subarray `a[x]` to `a[y]` is less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`. If this condition is true, or if `x == y`, the subarray is not good, and the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, the subarray is good, and the program prints 'YES'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The condition `x == y` is correctly handled to ensure that a subarray of length 1 is not good because there is no way to construct a different array `b` with the same sum and positive elements.
   - The cumulative sum check ensures that the sum of the subarray in `a` is not less than the sum of the corresponding subarray in `b`, which is a necessary condition for the subarray to be good.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as required and checks the conditions for a subarray to be good. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
