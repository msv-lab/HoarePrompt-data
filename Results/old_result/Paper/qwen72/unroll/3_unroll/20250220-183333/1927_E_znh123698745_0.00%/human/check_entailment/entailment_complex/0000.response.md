### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation of length `n` such that the sums of all continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.
   - The permutation should contain all integers from 1 to `n` exactly once.
   - `k` is guaranteed to be even.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an array `array` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It initializes `answer` with the first element as 1.
   - It uses a list `a` with two elements `[1, -1]` to keep track of the indices from which to pick elements for the permutation.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and alternates between appending elements from the end and the beginning of `array` to `answer`.

3. **Pattern and Validity:**
   - The pattern of appending elements from the end and the beginning of `array` ensures that the elements are distributed in a way that balances the sums of continuous segments of length `k`.
   - Since `k` is even, the pattern of alternating elements helps to keep the sums of the segments close to each other.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`:
     - `array = [1, 2, 3]`
     - `answer` starts as `[1]`
     - The loop appends `3` and then `2` to `answer`, resulting in `[1, 3, 2]`.
     - The sums of the segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`, which differ by 1, satisfying the condition.
   - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
     - `array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`
     - `answer` starts as `[1]`
     - The loop appends elements in the pattern `[10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`, resulting in `[1, 10, 2, 9, 3, 8, 4, 7, 5, 6]`.
     - The sums of the segments are:
       - `1 + 10 + 2 + 9 = 22`
       - `10 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 24`
       - `2 + 9 + 3 + 8 = 22`
       - `9 + 3 + 8 + 4 = 24`
       - `3 + 8 + 4 + 7 = 22`
       - `8 + 4 + 7 + 5 = 24`
       - `4 + 7 + 5 + 6 = 22`
     - The maximum and minimum sums are 24 and 22, respectively, which differ by 2. This does not satisfy the condition.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not always produce a valid k-level permutation. The example for `n = 10` and `k = 4` shows that the sums of the segments can differ by more than 1.
