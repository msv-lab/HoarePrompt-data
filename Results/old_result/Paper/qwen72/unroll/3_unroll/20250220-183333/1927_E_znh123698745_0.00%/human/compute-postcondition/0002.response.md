The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts multiple parameters, including `t` which is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, it accepts `n` and `k` which are integers such that 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and `k` is even. The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot determine the exact return value. However, we can describe the parameters it accepts.
