The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is the loop counter, and the result of `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. The state of `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
