Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, where `1 <= t <= 10^4`, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `k` is even. The function generates and prints a sequence of integers from 1 to `n` for each test case, arranged in a specific pattern: the first element is always 1, followed by alternating elements from the end and the beginning of the original array. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variables `t`, `n`, and `k` retain their initial values as they are not modified within the function. **
