The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, where each test case consists of parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is determined based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case and is determined based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.**
