The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it is expected to read input from the standard input, which consists of multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers: `k`, `x`, and `a`, where `2 ≤ k ≤ 30`, `1 ≤ x ≤ 100`, and `1 ≤ a ≤ 10^9`. The number of test cases, `t`, is an integer where `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.

The function processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of `k`, `x`, and `a`. However, the specific output for each test case is not provided in the constraints.

Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers k, x, and a. It processes each test case and returns a result based on the values of k, x, and a.**
