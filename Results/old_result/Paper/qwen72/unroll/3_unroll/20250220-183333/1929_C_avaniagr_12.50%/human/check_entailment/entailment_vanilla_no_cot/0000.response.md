Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using a specific logic, but it fails to correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Case `x < k - 1`**:
   - The logic `if a >= x + 1` is not correct. For example, if `k = 2` and `x = 1`, Sasha can always win by betting 1 coin each time, regardless of the initial number of coins `a`. The condition `a >= x + 1` is not necessary for this case.

2. **Incorrect Handling of the Case `x == k - 1`**:
   - The logic `if a >= x + 3` is also incorrect. For example, if `k = 2` and `x = 1`, Sasha can always win by betting 1 coin each time, and he doesn't need `a >= 4` to guarantee that he can win any number of coins.

3. **Incorrect Handling of the Case `x > k - 1`**:
   - The loop `for i in range(x + 1): z += z // (k - 1) + 1` is not a correct way to determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins. This loop does not accurately simulate the betting strategy and the conditions under which Sasha can win.

### Correct Approach:

To determine if Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins, we need to consider the following:

- **Case 1: `x < k - 1`**:
  - Sasha can always win by betting 1 coin each time. If he loses, he can still bet 1 coin again. Since he cannot lose more than `x` times in a row, he will eventually win and increase his coins. Therefore, the answer is always "YES" for this case.

- **Case 2: `x >= k - 1`**:
  - Sasha needs to ensure that he can recover from a series of `x` consecutive losses. If he loses `x` times in a row, he will lose `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + x` coins. The sum of the first `x` positive integers is `x * (x + 1) // 2`. After these losses, he must still have enough coins to place a bet that will recover his losses and allow him to continue betting. Therefore, the initial number of coins `a` must be at least `x * (x + 1) // 2 + 1`.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, x, a) = map(int, input().split())
        if x < k - 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            required_coins = x * (x + 1) // 2 + 1
            if a >= required_coins:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

This program correctly handles all the cases and will produce the expected output for the given problem.
