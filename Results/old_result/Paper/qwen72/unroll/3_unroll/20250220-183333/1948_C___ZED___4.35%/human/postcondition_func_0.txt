The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and two rows of arrows represented by strings `a` and `b`. It then determines and prints 'YES' if there is no path from the left to the right side of the grid, and 'NO' otherwise. Specifically, it checks if the second-to-last arrow in `b` is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if every second arrow in `b` (starting from index 0) is '>', and if not, it checks if every second arrow in `a` (starting from index 1) is '>'. If no such path exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.
