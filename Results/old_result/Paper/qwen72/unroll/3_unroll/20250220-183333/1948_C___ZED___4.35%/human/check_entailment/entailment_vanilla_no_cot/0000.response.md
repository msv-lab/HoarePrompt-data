Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Handling of `n == 1` Case:**
   - The problem description states that \( n \) is always even and \( 2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \). Therefore, the case where \( n == 1 \) should never occur, and the program should not have a check for it. This check is redundant and can be removed.

2. **Incorrect Path Checking Logic:**
   - The logic for checking if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) is flawed. The program checks if `b[-2]` is not '>', which is not a sufficient condition to determine if the robot can reach the target cell. The robot can potentially reach the target cell through other paths that are not considered by this check.
   - The program also checks if every second cell in `b` (starting from index 0) is not '>', and if every second cell in `a` (starting from index 1) is not '>'. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the robot's movement along the arrows and the possibility of the robot moving between rows.

3. **Incorrect Output for Some Test Cases:**
   - The program may incorrectly output 'NO' for some test cases where the robot can actually reach the target cell. For example, in the third test case of the example input, the program outputs 'NO' because it checks the arrows in `b` and `a` in a way that doesn't correctly simulate the robot's movement.

### Correct Approach:
To determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n), you need to simulate the robot's movement step by step, considering both the initial move and the subsequent move along the arrow. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, and it must follow the arrow in the current cell after each move. The correct approach would involve:

- Starting from cell (1, 1).
- Simulating the robot's movement for each possible move (left, right, up, down) and checking if it can reach cell (2, n) without going outside the grid.
- Ensuring that the robot can move along the arrows correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_reach_target(a, b, n):
    # Initialize the robot's position
    row, col = 1, 1
    
    # Set to keep track of visited cells to avoid infinite loops
    visited = set()
    visited.add((row, col))
    
    while True:
        # Check if the robot is at the target cell
        if row == 2 and col == n:
            return True
        
        # Move the robot according to the arrow in the current cell
        if row == 1:
            if a[col-1] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                col -= 1
        else:  # row == 2
            if b[col-1] == '>':
                col += 1
            else:
                col -= 1
        
        # Check if the robot is out of bounds
        if col < 1 or col > n:
            return False
        
        # Move the robot to the other row
        if row == 1:
            row = 2
        else:
            row = 1
        
        # Check if the robot has visited this cell before
        if (row, col) in visited:
            return False
        
        # Mark the current cell as visited
        visited.add((row, col))

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        if can_reach_target(a, b, n):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected version simulates the robot's movement more accurately and checks if it can reach the target cell (2, n) without getting stuck in an infinite loop or going outside the grid.
