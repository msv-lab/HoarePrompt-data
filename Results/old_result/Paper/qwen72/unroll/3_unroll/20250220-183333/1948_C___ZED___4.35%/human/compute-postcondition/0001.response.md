Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, reading the number of columns `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last arrow in `b` is not '>', and if so, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the left to the right by ensuring that every second arrow in `b` (starting from index 0) is '>', and if not, it checks if every second arrow in `a` (starting from index 1) is '>'. If no such path exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, and the loop will have completed its execution.**
