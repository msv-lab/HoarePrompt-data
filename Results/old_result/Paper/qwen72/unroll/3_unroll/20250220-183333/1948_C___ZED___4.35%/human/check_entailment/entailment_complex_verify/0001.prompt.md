You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, a list of integers n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) where each integer represents the number of columns in the grid for each test case, and a list of tuples (row1, row2) where each tuple contains two strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively. Additionally, n is even, there are no arrows pointing outside the grid, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        if b[-2] != '>':

        elif n == 1:

            if not no_path:

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reading the number of columns `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`. For each test case, it checks if the second-to-last arrow in `b` is not '>', and if so, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if there is a path from the left to the right by ensuring that every second arrow in `b` (starting from index 0) is '>', and if not, it checks if every second arrow in `a` (starting from index 1) is '>'. If no such path exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After all iterations, the variables `i`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `no_path` will have their final values based on the last test case processed, and the loop will have completed its execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and two rows of arrows represented by strings `a` and `b`. It then determines and prints 'YES' if there is no path from the left to the right side of the grid, and 'NO' otherwise. Specifically, it checks if the second-to-last arrow in `b` is not '>', and if so, prints 'NO'. If `n` is 1, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if every second arrow in `b` (starting from index 0) is '>', and if not, it checks if every second arrow in `a` (starting from index 1) is '>'. If no such path exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function completes its execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the first and second rows, respectively.

2. **Initial Check for the Last Column:**
   - The function checks if the second-to-last cell in the second row (`b[-2]`) is not pointing to the right (`>`). If it is not, the robot cannot reach the last cell `(2, n)` because it cannot move to the right from the second-to-last cell.
   - This check is correct and necessary.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`:**
   - The function checks if `n` is 1. However, the problem description states that `n` is always even and `2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5`. Therefore, `n` can never be 1, making this check redundant.
   - This check is incorrect and should be removed.

4. **Path Checking:**
   - The function attempts to check if there is a path from the starting cell `(1, 1)` to the target cell `(2, n)` by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - It first checks if there is a path in the second row (`b`) by iterating through the even-indexed cells (0, 2, 4, ...).
   - If any even-indexed cell in the second row does not point to the right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Then, it checks if there is a path in the first row (`a`) by iterating through the odd-indexed cells (1, 3, 5, ...).
   - If any odd-indexed cell in the first row does not point to the right (`>`), it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Final Path Determination:**
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after both checks, it prints `YES`, indicating that the robot can reach the target cell.
   - Otherwise, it prints `NO`.

### Issues:
- The special case for `n == 1` is incorrect and should be removed.
- The logic for checking the path is flawed. The function only checks if the robot can move to the right in the even and odd positions, but it does not consider the combined effect of the robot's movements and the arrows in the grid.

### Correct Logic:
- The robot starts at `(1, 1)`.
- It must be able to move to the second row at some point to reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
- The robot can only move to the second row if it encounters a cell in the first row that points down (`>`).
- Once in the second row, the robot must be able to move to the right until it reaches the target cell `(2, n)`.
- The robot can also move back to the first row if it encounters a cell in the second row that points up (`<`).

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        
        # Check if the second-to-last cell in the second row is not pointing to the right
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
            continue
        
        # Check if the robot can move to the second row
        can_move_to_second_row = False
        for k in range(n):
            if a[k] == '>':
                can_move_to_second_row = True
                break
        
        # Check if the robot can move to the right in the second row
        can_move_to_right_in_second_row = True
        for k in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            if b[k] == '<':
                can_move_to_right_in_second_row = False
                break
        
        if can_move_to_second_row and can_move_to_right_in_second_row:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Correctness:
- The original program is **incorrect** due to the redundant `n == 1` check and the flawed path checking logic.
- The corrected program accurately checks if the robot can move to the second row and then move to the right to reach the target cell.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
