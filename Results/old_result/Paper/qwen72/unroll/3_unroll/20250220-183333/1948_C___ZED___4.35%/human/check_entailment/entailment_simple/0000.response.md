### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and the two rows of arrows `a` and `b`.

2. **Initial Check**:
   - The program checks if the second-to-last arrow in the second row `b` is not pointing to the right (`b[-2] != '>'`). If this is the case, it immediately prints 'NO' because the robot cannot move to the last column from the second-to-last column in the second row.
   - This check is valid because the robot must be able to move to the last column in the second row to reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Special Case for `n == 1`**:
   - The program checks if `n` is 1 and prints 'YES' if it is. However, this check is unnecessary because the problem statement guarantees that `n` is at least 2 and is even. Therefore, this condition will never be true.

4. **Path Checking**:
   - The program initializes a variable `no_path` to `True` and then checks if there is a path from the left to the right by ensuring that every second arrow in `b` (starting from index 0) is pointing to the right (`>`). If any of these arrows is not pointing to the right, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` is still `True` after the first check, it performs a similar check for every second arrow in `a` (starting from index 1) to ensure they are all pointing to the right (`>`). If any of these arrows is not pointing to the right, it sets `no_path` to `False`.

5. **Final Output**:
   - If `no_path` is `True` after both checks, it prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.
   - If `no_path` is `False` after both checks, it prints 'NO', indicating that the robot cannot reach the target cell.

### Issues:
- **Special Case for `n == 1`**: This check is redundant and can be removed because `n` is guaranteed to be at least 2 and even.
- **Path Checking Logic**: The logic for checking the path is incorrect. The program should check if there is a way for the robot to move from the first column to the last column, considering both the initial move and the subsequent move along the arrow. The current logic only checks if every second arrow in `b` and `a` is pointing to the right, which is not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.

### Correct Logic:
- The robot must be able to move to the last column in the second row. This means:
  - The robot must be able to move to the second row at some point.
  - The robot must be able to move to the last column in the second row.

### Correctness:
- The program's logic for checking the path is flawed. It does not correctly account for the robot's movement rules and the requirement to reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
