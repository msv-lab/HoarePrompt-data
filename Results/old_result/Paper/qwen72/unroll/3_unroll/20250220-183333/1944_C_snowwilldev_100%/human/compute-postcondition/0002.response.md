Output State: **The function is still defined with parameters `t`, `test_cases`, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4, and for each test case, `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` contains `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. Additionally, `N` is an input integer. `a` is now a list of integers input by the user. `cnt` is a defaultdict with default value `int` (0).**
