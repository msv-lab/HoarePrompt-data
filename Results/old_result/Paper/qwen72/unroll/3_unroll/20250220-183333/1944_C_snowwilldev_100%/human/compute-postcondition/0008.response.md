The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers. The constraints are as follows:
- `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 · 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
- The list `a` contains `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. The result for each test case is determined based on the input `n` and the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer representing the number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list `a` of integers). It returns a list of results, where each result is based on the input `n` and the list `a` for each test case.**
