Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly handle the optimal strategy for both players. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal moves for Bob, who wants to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. The program only counts the number of unique elements in the array `a` and returns the smallest integer that is not present or has a count of 1, which is not the correct approach to determine the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:
```
1
4
0 1 2 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
3
```

**Actual Output:**
```
1
```

**Explanation:**
- Alice starts with an empty array `c` and the array `a` is `[0, 1, 2, 2]`.
- Alice can choose `2` (since it appears twice), so `a` becomes `[0, 1, 2]` and `c` becomes `[2]`.
- Bob can choose `0`, so `a` becomes `[1, 2]` and `c` remains `[2]`.
- Alice can choose `1`, so `a` becomes `[2]` and `c` becomes `[2, 1]`.
- Bob can choose `2`, so `a` becomes `[]` and `c` remains `[2, 1]`.

The MEX of `c` is `3` because `0`, `1`, and `2` are present in `c`, but `3` is not. However, the program returns `1` because it incorrectly counts the number of unique elements and does not simulate the game correctly.

This counterexample demonstrates that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, hence it is incorrect.
