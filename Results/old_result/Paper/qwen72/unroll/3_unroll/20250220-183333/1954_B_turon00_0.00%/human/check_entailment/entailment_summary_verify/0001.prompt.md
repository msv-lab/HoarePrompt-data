You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

- Program:
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        tmp = a[0]
        aa = set(a)
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
        cnt = 0
        ans = n
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == tmp:
                cnt += 1
            else:
                ans = min(ans, cnt)
                cnt = 0
        ans = min(ans, cnt)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it prints the minimum length of consecutive elements in the array `a` that are the same as the first element. If all elements in the array `a` are the same, it prints -1. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the program state is reset for the next call.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Check for All Identical Elements**: The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If the set has only one unique element, it prints `-1` because an array of identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any number of elements.

3. **Counting Consecutive Identical Elements**: The program initializes a variable `cnt` to count consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp` in the array. It then iterates through the array, incrementing `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` and resetting `cnt` to 0 when a different element is encountered.

4. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Count**: The program keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive identical elements encountered by updating `ans` with the minimum value of `cnt` at each reset. After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final value of `cnt`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. If the array is already non-beautiful, the minimum count will be the length of the array `n`.

However, there is a logical flaw in the program:

- The program only checks for consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp`. This is incorrect because the array can be beautiful if any element can be replaced to make all elements the same, not just the first element. The program should consider all elements, not just the first one.

To fix this, the program should:

- Count the maximum number of consecutive identical elements for each unique element in the array.
- The minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful would be the maximum count of consecutive identical elements for any unique element.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        aa = set(a)
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        max_consecutive = 0
        for x in aa:
            cnt = 0
            max_cnt = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if a[i] == x:
                    cnt += 1
                else:
                    max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cnt)
                    cnt = 0
            max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cnt)
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, max_cnt)
        
        if max_consecutive < 2:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_consecutive)

func()
```

Explanation of the corrected program:
- For each unique element `x` in the set `aa`, it counts the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `x` in the array.
- The maximum of these counts is stored in `max_consecutive`.
- If `max_consecutive` is less than 2, it means the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements, so it prints `-1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `max_consecutive`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Given the original program's logical flaw, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**
