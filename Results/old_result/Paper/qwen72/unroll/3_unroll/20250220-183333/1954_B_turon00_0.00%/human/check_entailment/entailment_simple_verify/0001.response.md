Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Check for All Identical Elements**: The program checks if all elements in the array are the same by converting the array to a set and checking its length. If the set has only one unique element, it prints `-1` because an array of identical elements cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any number of elements. This part of the program is correct.

3. **Counting Consecutive Identical Elements**: The program initializes a variable `cnt` to count consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp` in the array. It then iterates through the array, incrementing `cnt` for each occurrence of `tmp` and resetting `cnt` to 0 when a different element is encountered. This part is also correct for counting consecutive occurrences of the first element.

4. **Finding Minimum Consecutive Count**: The program keeps track of the minimum count of consecutive identical elements encountered by updating `ans` with the minimum value of `cnt` at each reset. After the loop, it updates `ans` one last time with the final value of `cnt`. This approach is flawed because it only considers consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp`, not all elements in the array.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum count of consecutive identical elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. However, due to the logical flaw mentioned in point 4, the output is incorrect for arrays where the first element is not the one with the longest consecutive sequence.

**Key Flaw**:
- The program only checks for consecutive occurrences of the first element `tmp`. This is incorrect because the array can be beautiful if any element can be replaced to make all elements the same, not just the first element. The program should consider all elements, not just the first one.

**Correct Approach**:
- Count the maximum number of consecutive identical elements for each unique element in the array.
- The minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful would be the maximum count of consecutive identical elements for any unique element.

**Corrected Program**:
```python
import math
import os
import random
import re
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        aa = set(a)
        if len(aa) == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        max_consecutive = 0
        for x in aa:
            cnt = 0
            max_cnt = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if a[i] == x:
                    cnt += 1
                else:
                    max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cnt)
                    cnt = 0
            max_cnt = max(max_cnt, cnt)
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, max_cnt)
        
        if max_consecutive < 2:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_consecutive)

func()
```

**Explanation of the Corrected Program**:
- For each unique element `x` in the set `aa`, it counts the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of `x` in the array.
- The maximum of these counts is stored in `max_consecutive`.
- If `max_consecutive` is less than 2, it means the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing any elements, so it prints `-1`.
- Otherwise, it prints `max_consecutive`, which is the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful.

Given the original program's logical flaw, the correctness is:

Final: **False**
