Reasoning:

The program aims to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a beautiful array to make it no longer beautiful. A beautiful array is defined as one where the operation of replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) (where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\) and \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\)) can be applied to make all elements the same.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Single Unique Element:**
   - If the array contains only one unique element (i.e., all elements are the same), it is impossible to make the array non-beautiful by removing elements. The program correctly handles this case by checking if the length of the set `aa` is 1 and printing -1.

2. **Finding the Minimum Consecutive Elements:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to `n` (the length of the array), which is the maximum number of elements that could be removed.
   - It then iterates through the array to find the minimum length of consecutive elements that are the same as the first element (`tmp`).
   - The variable `cnt` is used to count the length of consecutive elements that match `tmp`.
   - When a different element is encountered, `ans` is updated to the minimum of the current `ans` and `cnt`, and `cnt` is reset to 0.

3. **Final Update:**
   - After the loop, `ans` is updated one last time to ensure the final segment of consecutive elements is considered.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Removal:**
  - The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. It only considers the length of consecutive elements that match the first element (`tmp`). However, the problem requires finding the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, which means breaking the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) for any \(i\) where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\).

### Correct Approach:
- To make the array non-beautiful, you need to break the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) for any \(i\) where \(2 \le i \le |a| - 1\). This can be done by removing elements that are part of such sequences.
- The correct approach would involve identifying the longest sequence of elements that can be removed to break the condition and then calculating the minimum number of elements to remove.

### Example Analysis:
- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `2 2 2`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Correct: The array is already non-beautiful if all elements are the same, and removing any element will not change this.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `1 2 1 2 1`
  - Output: `1`
  - Correct: Removing the element at index 5 (0-based index) results in `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `1`
  - Output: `-1`
  - Correct: A single-element array is trivially non-beautiful.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `3 3 3 5 3 3 3`
  - Output: `3`
  - Correct: Removing the first three elements results in `[5, 3, 3, 3]`, which is not beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for finding the minimum number of elements to remove is incorrect. It only checks for consecutive elements that match the first element, which does not necessarily break the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

Correctness: **False**
