Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful is flawed. Here's a case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
2
```

The program initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and then counts the number of consecutive elements that are equal to `tmp`. It then updates the minimum count of such consecutive elements. However, this approach does not correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array stop being beautiful.

In the given test case, the array is `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The program will count the number of consecutive `1`s, which are at the beginning and end of the array, and will output `2` (the minimum count of consecutive `1`s). However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing the last `1` will result in the array `[1, 2, 1, 2]`, which is not beautiful.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the entire structure of the array and identify the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to break the "beautiful" property. The current logic is too simplistic and does not account for all possible scenarios.
