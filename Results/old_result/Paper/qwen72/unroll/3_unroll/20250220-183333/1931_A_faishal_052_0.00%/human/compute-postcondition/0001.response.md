The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `cases`. For the loop to execute, `cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range` function at the start of the loop. The condition that `n` should be an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78 is not directly related to the loop head and does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
