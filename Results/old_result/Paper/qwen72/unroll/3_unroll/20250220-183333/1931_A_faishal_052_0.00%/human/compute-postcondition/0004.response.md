Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `cases` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `lex` (3 ≤ lex ≤ 78) from the input, processes it to generate a list `arr` of three integers, sorts this list, and then prints a string of three lowercase Latin letters corresponding to the sorted values in `arr`. The letters are determined by the positions in the alphabet (1 for 'a', 2 for 'b', etc.). The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. **
