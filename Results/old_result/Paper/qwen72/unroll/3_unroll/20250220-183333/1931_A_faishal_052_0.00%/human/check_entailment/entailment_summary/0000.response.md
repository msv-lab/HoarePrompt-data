Reasoning:  
The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that sums up to a given integer `lex`. The approach taken by the program is to break down the integer `lex` into three parts, each representing a letter's position in the alphabet. However, the logic used to break down `lex` is flawed and does not always produce the correct result.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the encoded integer for each test case.
2. **Breakdown Logic**:
   - The program attempts to subtract 26 from `lex` and append 26 to `arr` if `lex` is greater than 26.
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - This logic is repeated twice to fill the first two elements of `arr`.
   - The remaining value of `lex` is then appended to `arr`.
3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The list `arr` is sorted, and the corresponding letters are printed.
   - Sorting ensures that the smallest possible letters are used first, which is necessary for lexicographical order.

However, the logic for breaking down `lex` is incorrect. For example:
- If `lex` is 24, the program will append [1, 1, 22] to `arr`, which is correct.
- If `lex` is 70, the program will append [26, 26, 18] to `arr`, but the correct answer should be [18, 26, 26] which corresponds to "rzz".

The correct approach should be:
- Start by finding the largest possible value for the first letter that is less than or equal to `lex`.
- Subtract this value from `lex` and repeat for the second letter.
- The remaining value will be the third letter.

Given the current implementation, the program does not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
