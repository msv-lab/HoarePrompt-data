Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually. This is in line with the problem description.

2. **Initialization and Loop**: For each test case, an empty list `arr` is initialized to store the positions of the letters. The loop runs twice to determine the first two letters of the word.

3. **Letter Position Calculation**:
   - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it means the remaining sum can be represented by a single letter, so the function appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it means the remaining sum can be represented by a letter 'z' (position 26) and a smaller letter, so the function appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - If `lex` is greater than 51, it means the remaining sum can be represented by two 'z' letters, so the function appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.

4. **Final Letter**: After the loop, the remaining value of `lex` is appended to `arr`, which represents the position of the third letter.

5. **Sorting**: The list `arr` is sorted to ensure the lexicographically smallest word is formed. This is a crucial step because the smallest word is determined by the smallest possible values in the correct order.

6. **Output**: The function then converts the positions in `arr` to their corresponding letters using `chr(arr[k] + 96)` and prints them without spaces.

However, there is a logical issue in the program:
- The condition `if lex <= 26:` should be handled differently. Instead of always appending 1 and subtracting 1, it should append the actual value of `lex` and set `lex` to 0. This ensures that the correct letter is chosen, not just 'a'.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for i in range(cases):
        arr = []
        
        lex = int(input())
        
        for j in range(2):
            if lex <= 26:
                arr.append(lex)
                lex = 0
                break
            elif lex < 52:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
            else:
                arr.append(26)
                lex = lex - 26
        
        if lex > 0:
            arr.append(lex)
        
        arr.sort()
        
        for k in range(3):
            print(chr(arr[k] + 96), end='')
        
        print()  # Add a newline after each word

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given the original program, the issue with the logic for handling `lex <= 26` means that it will not always produce the correct lexicographically smallest word. For example, for the input `24`, the original program will output `aav` instead of `cat`.

Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
