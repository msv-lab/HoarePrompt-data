### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`cases`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which is the encoded sum of the positions of three lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Processing the Encoded Sum**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `arr` to store the positions of the letters.
   - It then iterates twice (for the first two letters) and checks the value of `lex`:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 1 to `arr` and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex` is less than 52, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Otherwise, it appends 26 to `arr` and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
   - After the loop, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to `arr`.

3. **Sorting and Output**:
   - The function sorts the list `arr` to ensure the lexicographically smallest order.
   - It then converts each integer in `arr` to its corresponding letter by adding 96 (since 'a' is at position 1 in the alphabet, and its ASCII value is 97).
   - Finally, it prints the three letters as a single string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases correctly:
     - For `lex = 3`, it outputs "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3).
     - For `lex = 78`, it outputs "zzz" (26 + 26 + 26 = 78).
   - The function ensures that the sum of the positions of the letters in `arr` equals `lex`.

5. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The function correctly ensures that the output is the lexicographically smallest word by sorting the positions of the letters.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements and edge cases. It generates the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded sum and prints the result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
