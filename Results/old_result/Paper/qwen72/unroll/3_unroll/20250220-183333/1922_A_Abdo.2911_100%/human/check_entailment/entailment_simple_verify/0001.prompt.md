You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any. The correct function definition should include an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) representing the length of the strings, and three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input().strip()
        
        b = input().strip()
        
        c = input().strip()
        
        possible = False
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = True
                    break
            elif c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                continue
            else:
                possible = True
                break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: The function `func_1` will have processed all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it will have printed 'YES' if there was at least one position `i` where `a[i]` was equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` was different, or if `c[i]` was different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`. Otherwise, it will have printed 'NO'. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` will no longer hold their initial values, as they are overwritten in each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Matching Conditions:**
   - A string `s` matches a template `t` if:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, then `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.

3. **Logic for Determining the Template:**
   - The function iterates through each position `i` of the strings.
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`:
     - The template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True`.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]`:
     - The template at position `i` can be any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the function continues to the next position.
     - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True`.

4. **Output:**
   - After iterating through all positions, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
  - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template.
  - This logic is correct.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
  - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the function continues to the next position.
  - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template.
  - This logic is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
