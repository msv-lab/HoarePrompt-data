### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the strings `n` and the three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
   - This part is correctly implemented and matches the problem description.

2. **Template Matching Conditions:**
   - A string `s` matches a template `t` if:
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is lowercase, then `s[i]` must be the same as `t[i]`.
     - For each position `i`, if `t[i]` is uppercase, then `s[i]` must be different from the lowercase version of `t[i]`.
   - This understanding of the template matching conditions is correct.

3. **Logic for Determining the Template:**
   - The function iterates through each position `i` of the strings.
   - **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
     - If `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True`.
     - This logic is correct.
   - **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
     - If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
     - If `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`, then `c` matches the template, and the function continues to the next position.
     - If `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`, then `c` does not match the template, and the function sets `possible` to `True`.
     - This logic is also correct.

4. **Output:**
   - After iterating through all positions, if `possible` is `True`, the function prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This part is correctly implemented and matches the problem description.

### Analysis of the Program:
- **Case 1: `a[i] == b[i]`**
  - The function correctly identifies that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, the template at position `i` must be the uppercase version of `a[i]` (or `b[i]`).
  - The function correctly checks if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]` (or `b[i]`), and if so, sets `possible` to `True`.
  - This logic is correct.

- **Case 2: `a[i] != b[i]`**
  - The function correctly identifies that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, the template at position `i` can be any uppercase letter that is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
  - The function correctly continues to the next position if `c[i]` is equal to either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.
  - The function correctly sets `possible` to `True` if `c[i]` is different from both `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
  - This logic is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. The conditions and the flow of the program are consistent with the problem description.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program is correct.

Final: **True**
