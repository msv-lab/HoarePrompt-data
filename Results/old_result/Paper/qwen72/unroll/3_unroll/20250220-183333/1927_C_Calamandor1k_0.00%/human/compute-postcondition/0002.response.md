Output State: **The loop iterates `t` times, and for each iteration, it reads new values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, and new lists `a` and `b`. After processing, it prints 'YES' if the number of elements in `a` and `b` that are less than or equal to `k` is at least `k // 2`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are reset for each iteration, and `t` is decremented by 1 after each iteration until the loop completes.**
