You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has prepared a set of n problems with complexities a_1 < a_2 < a_3 <
\dots < a_n . He is not entirely satisfied with the balance, so he wants to
add at most one problem to fix it.

For this, Rudolf came up with m models of problems and k functions. The
complexity of the i -th model is d_i , and the complexity of the j -th
function is f_j . To create a problem, he selects values i and j (1 \le i \le
m , 1 \le j \le k ) and by combining the i -th model with the j -th function,
he obtains a new problem with complexity d_i + f_j (a new element is inserted
into the array a ).

To determine the imbalance of the set, Rudolf sorts the complexities of the
problems in ascending order and finds the largest value of a_i - a_{i - 1} (i
> 1 ).

What is the minimum value of imbalance that Rudolf can achieve by adding at
most one problem, created according to the described rules?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of testcases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (2 \le
n \le 10^5 , 1 \le m, k \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of prepared problems,
the number of models, and the number of functions, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n
(1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^9 , a_i < a_{i+1} ) — the complexities of the
prepared problems.

The third line of each test case contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m
(1 \le d_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the models.

The fourth line of each test case contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k
(1 \le f_i \le 10^9 ) — the complexities of the functions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of m over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of k over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each testcase, output a single number — the minimum imbalance that Rudolf
can achieve.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a callable function `func` as a parameter and returns a callable function `wrapper`. The dictionary `d` remains empty after the function concludes.

    return d[args]
    #The program returns the computed result of `func(*args)` if `args` is not already in the dictionary `d`. If `args` is in `d`, the program returns the value associated with `args` in `d`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `wrapper` does not accept any parameters. It checks if a tuple `args` is present in a dictionary `d`. If `args` is not in `d`, it computes the result of `func(*args)` and stores it in `d` with `args` as the key. The function then returns the value associated with `args` in `d`. If `args` is already in `d`, the function simply returns the value associated with `args` without recomputing it.

#Function 3:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace from the line, and returns the processed line. It does not take any parameters and does not modify any external variables. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that a line of input has been read and stripped of trailing whitespace, and this line is returned to the caller.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value obtained by calling the function `func_2()`. The state of the program after the function concludes is that an integer value is returned, which is the result of the `func_2()` call.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts a parameter `delimiter` (a string, defaulting to a single space ' ') and returns a list of integers. These integers are obtained by splitting the string returned by `func_2()` using the specified `delimiter` and converting each resulting substring to an integer. The function does not modify any external state or variables.

    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts no parameters and returns no values. It operates on integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, and lists `A`, `D`, and `F` with specific constraints. The function identifies the maximum and second maximum differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `A`. It then uses a binary search to find the minimum possible maximum difference between a modified value from `D` and the elements `left` and `right` in `A`, where `left` and `right` are the elements surrounding the maximum difference. Finally, the function prints the larger of the two values: the minimum possible maximum difference found or the second maximum difference. The state of `n`, `m`, `k`, `A`, `D`, and `F` remains unchanged throughout the function's execution.

    for _ in range(testcases):
        func_6()
        
    #State: `testcases` is the return value of `func_3()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It retrieves a number of test cases by calling `func_3` and then iterates that many times, calling `func_6` in each iteration. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the variable `testcases` holds the return value of `func_3`, and `func_6` has been called `testcases` times.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program uses a series of functions to read input from `sys.stdin`. These functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are designed to handle different types of input, such as reading a single line, converting it to an integer, or splitting it into a list of integers.
   - The `func_7` function is the main function that processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_6` for each test case.

2. **Problem Setup:**
   - `func_6` reads the input for each test case, including the number of prepared problems (`n`), the number of models (`m`), and the number of functions (`k`).
   - It also reads the complexities of the prepared problems (`A`), the models (`D`), and the functions (`F`).
   - The models are sorted and duplicates are removed using `sorted(set(func_4()))`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Difference:**
   - The program iterates through the list of prepared problems to find the maximum difference (`max_diff`) between consecutive complexities.
   - It also keeps track of the second largest difference (`next_max_diff`) and the index where the maximum difference occurs.

4. **Binary Search for Optimal Insertion:**
   - The program uses binary search to find the optimal position to insert a new problem complexity.
   - It calculates the potential new complexities by adding each function complexity (`f`) to each model complexity (`D`).
   - The binary search is used to find the range of models that can potentially reduce the maximum difference.
   - The program then checks the minimum possible imbalance by comparing the new differences with the current maximum difference.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum possible imbalance for each test case.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Input Handling:**
  - The input handling functions are correctly implemented and should work as expected for the given problem constraints.

- **Finding the Maximum Difference:**
  - The loop to find the maximum difference is correct. It correctly identifies the largest and second largest differences and their indices.

- **Binary Search for Optimal Insertion:**
  - The binary search is used to find the optimal position to insert a new complexity. The logic inside the binary search loop is correct, but it can be simplified.
  - The program correctly calculates the potential new complexities and checks the minimum possible imbalance.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the maximum difference is already minimal or where no new problem can reduce the imbalance.

### Potential Issues:

- **Binary Search Logic:**
  - The binary search logic is a bit complex and can be simplified. The current implementation uses a while loop with a midpoint calculation, but it can be simplified to a single binary search call.

- **Function 1 and Function 2:**
  - `func_1` and `wrapper` are not used in the program. They seem to be remnants of a memoization or caching mechanism that is not needed for this problem.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct in its logic and should solve the problem as described. However, it can be simplified and optimized, especially the binary search part.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
