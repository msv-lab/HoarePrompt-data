The function `func` accepts a single parameter, which is a list of integers `t`. Each integer in the list `t` must satisfy the constraint 1 <= t[i] <= 50, and the length of the list `t` must be within the range 1 <= len(t) <= 50. Each integer `n` in the list `t` represents a test case and must satisfy 1 <= n <= 50. The function returns a list of results based on the input list `t`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `t` where each integer is between 1 and 50, and the list length is also between 1 and 50. It returns a list of results based on the input list `t`.**
