You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should be called with a single argument, which is a list of integers t, where each integer in the list satisfies 1 <= t[i] <= 50, and the length of the list is also within the range 1 <= len(t) <= 50. Each integer n in the list t represents a test case and must satisfy 1 <= n <= 50.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n % 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            s = '110' * (n // 2)
            if len(s) < 200:
                print('YES')
                print(s)
            else:
                print('NO')
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations. For each integer `n` in the input list `t`, if `n` is odd, 'NO' was printed. If `n` is even and less than or equal to 200, 'YES' and a string `s` consisting of '110' repeated `n // 2` times was printed. If `n` is even and greater than 200, 'NO' was printed. The variable `t` remains unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`.

2. **Special Character Condition**:
   - The problem states that a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
   - The program checks if `n` is odd using `if n % 2:`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to have an odd number of special characters in a string where each special character must be part of a pair (one character equal to one of its neighbors).

3. **String Construction**:
   - If `n` is even, the program constructs a string `s` using the pattern '110' repeated `n // 2` times.
   - The pattern '110' ensures that each '1' is a special character because it is equal to one of its neighbors (the other '1' in the pair '11').

4. **String Length Check**:
   - The program checks if the length of the constructed string `s` is less than 200 using `if len(s) < 200:`.
   - If the length is within the limit, it prints 'YES' followed by the string `s`.
   - If the length exceeds 200, it prints 'NO'. However, this check is unnecessary because the maximum value of `n` is 50, and the length of the string `s` will always be `3 * (n // 2)`, which is at most `3 * 25 = 75`. This is always less than 200.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints 'NO' for odd `n` and 'YES' followed by a valid string for even `n`.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and output as specified.
- It correctly identifies when a solution is impossible (odd `n`).
- It constructs a valid string for even `n` that meets the problem's requirements.
- The length check for the string is redundant but does not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
