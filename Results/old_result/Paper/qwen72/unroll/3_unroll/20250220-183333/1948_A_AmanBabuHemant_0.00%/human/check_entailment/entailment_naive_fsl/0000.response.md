Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the requirement to generate a string of uppercase Latin letters. Instead, it generates a string composed of the characters '1' and '0', which are not uppercase Latin letters. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for any input.

Example Case:
- Input: `1\n6`
- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  AAABAACC
  ```
- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  110110
  ```
This output is incorrect because the string should be composed of uppercase Latin letters, not '1' and '0'.
