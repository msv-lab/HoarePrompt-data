Functionality: ** The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters: an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. However, the function currently does not perform any actions or return any results, as it only contains a `pass` statement. The intended purpose of the function, based on the annotations, is to process each test case and return a list of results, one for each test case, but this is not implemented in the provided code. **
