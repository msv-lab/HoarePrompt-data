Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle the case where the array `a` contains duplicate elements. The logic of the program is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of multiple elements being equal to `la` or `lb`. This can lead to incorrect penalties being calculated.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
5
1 2 2 3 4
```
The expected output is `2` because the optimal way to split the array is `s = [1, 2, 2]` and `t = [3, 4]`, resulting in a penalty of `p(s) + p(t) = 1 + 1 = 2`.

However, the program will output `1` because it incorrectly updates `la` and `lb` when encountering duplicate elements, leading to an incorrect penalty calculation.

To correctly handle this, the program should ensure that `la` and `lb` are updated in a way that minimizes the penalty for all possible cases, including those with duplicate elements.
