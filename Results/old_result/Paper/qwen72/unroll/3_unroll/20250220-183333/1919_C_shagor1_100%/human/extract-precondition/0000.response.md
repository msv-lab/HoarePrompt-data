Precondition: **The function should take two parameters: an integer t representing the number of test cases, and a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer n and a list of integers a. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, and a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. It should be updated to reflect the correct parameters:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n` and `a`.
