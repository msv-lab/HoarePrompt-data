You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: t, a list of lists where each inner list represents a test case and contains n integers representing stick lengths, and n. t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and each n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100. Each stick length a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    ans = 0
    cnt = dict()
    for x in a:
        cnt[x] = cnt.get(x, 0) + 1
        
    #State: `ans` is 0, `n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same list of integers input by the user, `t` is the same integer, and `cnt` is a dictionary where each key is a tuple of stick lengths from the list `a`, and each value is the count of how many times that tuple appears in the list `a`.
    for x in cnt.values():
        ans += x // 4
        
    #State: `ans` is the sum of the floor division of each value in `cnt` by 4, `n` is the same input integer, `a` is the same list of integers input by the user, `t` is the same integer, and `cnt` is the same dictionary.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of the floor division of each value in the dictionary `cnt` by 4)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (number of test cases), a list of lists `a` (stick lengths for each test case), and an integer `n` (number of sticks per test case). It returns a list of results, where each result is "Yes" if the sum of stick lengths in the corresponding test case is even, and "No" if the sum is odd.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
