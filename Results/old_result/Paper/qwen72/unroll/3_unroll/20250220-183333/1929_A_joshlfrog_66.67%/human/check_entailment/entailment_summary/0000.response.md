Reasoning:  
The problem requires us to find the maximum beauty of an array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the array, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then calculating the sum of the differences.

However, the provided program does not sort the array. Instead, it finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference. This approach is incorrect because the maximum beauty is not necessarily the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array.

For example, consider the array \([1, 3, 2]\):
- If we sort it to \([1, 2, 3]\), the beauty is \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\).
- The program, however, would output \(3 - 1 = 2\), which is coincidentally correct for this specific case but not generally correct.

To correctly solve the problem, we should:
1. Sort the array.
2. Calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Given this, the program provided is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
