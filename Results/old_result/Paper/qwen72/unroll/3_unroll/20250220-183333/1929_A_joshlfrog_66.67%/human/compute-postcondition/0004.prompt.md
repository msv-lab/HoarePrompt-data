You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: The function will print the difference between the maximum and minimum values of each list in the input. The variables `x` and `y` will be reset to 0 and 100000000 respectively for each iteration of the outer loop. After all iterations, the function will have printed `t` lines, each containing the difference for the corresponding list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists `cases` where each inner list contains `n` integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) with each integer `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns a list of results, one for each test case, based on the integers in the inner lists.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
