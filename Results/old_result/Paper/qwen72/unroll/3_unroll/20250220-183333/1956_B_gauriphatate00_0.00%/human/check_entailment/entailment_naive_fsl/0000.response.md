Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get by taking your turns optimally, given that Nene plays optimally as well. Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It counts the number of pairs of cards you have using the `Counter` from the `collections` module.
   - It then calculates the minimum of the number of pairs and `n // 2` to determine the maximum number of points you can get. This is because you can only score a point if Nene has already placed a card with the same number on the table, and you can only place up to `n // 2` cards in your turns.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads the input from `sys.stdin` and processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of cards `n` and the list of cards `a` in your hand.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The program handles all edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description:
- It correctly processes multiple test cases.
- It correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
- It correctly handles the case where you have no pairs of cards.
- It correctly handles the case where you have all pairs of cards.

Since the program meets all the requirements and constraints specified in the problem description, it is correct.
