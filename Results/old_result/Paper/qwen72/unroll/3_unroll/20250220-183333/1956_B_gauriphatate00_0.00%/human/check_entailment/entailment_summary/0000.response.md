Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of cards in each player's hand) and `a` (the list of integers on the cards in your hand).
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`.
   - It then calculates the number of integers that appear exactly twice (`pairs`).
   - The function returns the minimum value between `pairs` and `n // 2`.

   This function is designed to determine the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The logic is based on the fact that you can only score a point if you play a card that matches a card already on the table. Since Nene plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize yours, the best strategy for you is to play cards that have a pair in your hand, but only if Nene hasn't already played the matching card. The maximum number of such pairs you can have is `n // 2` because each integer can appear at most twice in your hand.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from the standard input.
   - It processes the input to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n` and the list `a` from the input data.
   - It calls `func_1` with `n` and `a` and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each result in `results`.

   This function correctly handles the input and output format specified in the problem. It reads the number of test cases `t`, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results.

3. **Overall Program Analysis**:
   - The program is designed to handle multiple test cases as specified.
   - For each test case, `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally.
   - The input and output handling in `func_2` is consistent with the problem description.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program appears to correctly solve the problem by determining the maximum number of points you can get in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
