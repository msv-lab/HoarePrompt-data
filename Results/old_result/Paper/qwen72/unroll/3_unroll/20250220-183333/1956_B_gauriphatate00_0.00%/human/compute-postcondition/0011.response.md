The function `func_2` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships given, it can be inferred that the function accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n and appears at most twice in the list.

The output of the function is not specified, so we cannot determine what the function returns based on the given information. However, we can describe the parameters it accepts.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (a positive integer between 1 and 10^4), `n` (a positive integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5), and `a` (a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` and appears at most twice in the list).**
