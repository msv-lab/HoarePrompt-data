Output State: **The loop will execute `t` times, and for each iteration, it will read an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`. After processing, it will print 'No' if any of the conditions in the inner loop are met, otherwise it will print 'Yes'. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` will be consumed and no longer available after the loop completes.**
