Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly reconstruct the permutation `p` from the array `a`. The logic used in the program to determine the values of `p` is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization of `mex`**:
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`. This is not necessarily correct. The MEX of the entire permutation `p` should be `n` only if all numbers from `0` to `n-1` are present in `p`. However, during the construction of `p`, `mex` should be dynamically updated based on the elements of `p` that have been determined so far.

2. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program constructs `p` in reverse order. While this is a valid approach, the way `mex` is updated is incorrect. The program updates `mex` by subtracting `ar[i]` from the current `mex`, which does not correctly reflect the MEX of the prefix of `p`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The MEX of a prefix of `p` should be the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the prefix. The program does not correctly maintain this property. For example, if `ar[i]` is negative, the program might incorrectly update `mex` to a value that is not the true MEX.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly reconstruct `p` from `a`, you need to maintain a set of used numbers and dynamically calculate the MEX for each prefix. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        used = set()
        mex = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            res[i] = mex + ar[i]
            used.add(res[i])
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `used` is a set to keep track of the numbers that have been used in the permutation `p`.
   - `mex` is initialized to `0` because the MEX of an empty array is `0`.

2. **Forward Construction**:
   - The program constructs `p` in the forward direction.
   - For each index `i`, it calculates the MEX of the current prefix by finding the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
   - It then sets `res[i]` to `mex + ar[i]` and adds `res[i]` to the `used` set.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p`.

This approach ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and the permutation `p` is constructed to satisfy the given array `a`.
