The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it reads input values directly, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. The function processes these inputs and returns the result based on the given test cases.

Functionality: **The function reads the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only '<' and '>'. It processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case.**
