Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `n` and an array `a` of length `n`. For each test case, it calculates a new array `res` where each element `res[i]` is determined by the formula `mex - ar[i]`, with `mex` initially set to `n` and updated during the calculation. After processing each test case, the function prints the resulting array `res`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The variables `n`, `ar`, `res`, and `mex` are reset for each new test case, and the function continues processing until all test cases are handled. **
