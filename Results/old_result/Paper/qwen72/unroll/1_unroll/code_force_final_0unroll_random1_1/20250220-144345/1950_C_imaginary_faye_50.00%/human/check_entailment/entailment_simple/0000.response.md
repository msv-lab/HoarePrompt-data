Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` is defined without any arguments, but it correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t` and then reading each time string `s` for each test case. This is appropriate for the problem description, which states that the input will be provided in the form of multiple test cases.

2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour is `00`, it correctly converts it to `12` and appends `AM`.
   - If the hour is between `01` and `12`, it correctly prints the hour as is and appends `AM`.
   - If the hour is between `13` and `23`, it correctly converts it to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 and appends `PM`.

3. **Minute Handling**: The function correctly prints the minutes as they are, which is appropriate since the minute format is the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

4. **Output Format**: The function prints the time in the correct format, ensuring that the hour is followed by the minutes and then the appropriate `AM` or `PM` indicator.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the hour is `00` (midnight) and converts it to `12:00 AM`.
   - It also correctly handles the edge case where the hour is `12` (noon) and keeps it as `12:00 PM`.

6. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs `t` times, processing each test case as expected.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly convert the given 24-hour format time to the 12-hour format and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
