Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of balanced parentheses "(", ")" and returns a new string. The new string is formed by concatenating the characters of `s` in an order determined by sorting the characters based on their balance value in ascending order and, for characters with the same balance value, by their index in descending order. The balance value is the difference between the number of opening and closing parentheses encountered up to that point in the string. The final state of the program is that the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function returns the newly constructed string. **
