The function `func` is expected to read input from stdin and write output to stdout. The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, followed by a string a of length n consisting only of 0 and 1, where a_j = 0 if the resident of the j-th house wants to live on the left side, and a_j = 1 if they want to live on the right side. The number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4) is provided at the beginning of the input. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.
