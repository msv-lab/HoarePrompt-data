Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, b is a list of m integers where each integer b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^6, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `t` times, and each iteration processes a new set of inputs for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`.
- The `cnt_b` list is reset to all zeros at the end of each iteration, so it remains a list of 1000001 zeros after all iterations.
- The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `max_val` are not modified within the loop body, so their values remain unchanged.
- The loop calculates the number of valid subarrays of `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` elements from `b` and prints this count for each test case. However, this does not affect the initial state of the variables.
