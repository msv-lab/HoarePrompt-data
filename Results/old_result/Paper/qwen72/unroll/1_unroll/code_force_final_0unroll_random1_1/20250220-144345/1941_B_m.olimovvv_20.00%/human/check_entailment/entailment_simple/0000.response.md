### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `b`.

2. **Conditions for Validity:**
   - The function checks two conditions:
     - `if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`: This condition checks if the first element of the array is odd and if the second element is not exactly 2 more than the first element. If this condition is true, the function prints 'NO'.
     - `if b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`: This condition checks if the last element of the array is odd and if the second-to-last element is not exactly 2 more than the last element. If this condition is true, the function prints 'NO'.
   - If neither of these conditions is true, the function prints 'YES'.

3. **Logical Flaw:**
   - The conditions checked are not sufficient to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros. The conditions only check the first and last elements, but the operation can be applied to any index `i` where `2 <= i <= n-1`.
   - The correct approach should involve checking if the sum of the elements in the array is divisible by 3 and if the array can be reduced to all zeros by repeatedly applying the operation. However, the given conditions do not cover these aspects.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the first test case `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the function correctly prints 'YES' because the conditions are not triggered.
   - For the second test case `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, the function incorrectly prints 'NO' because the conditions are triggered, but the array can actually be reduced to all zeros.
   - For the third test case `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`, the function correctly prints 'YES' because the conditions are not triggered.
   - For the fourth test case `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`, the function incorrectly prints 'NO' because the conditions are triggered, but the array can actually be reduced to all zeros.
   - For the fifth test case `[1, 2, 7, 2]`, the function incorrectly prints 'NO' because the conditions are triggered, but the array can actually be reduced to all zeros.
   - For the sixth test case `[7, 1, 0]`, the function incorrectly prints 'NO' because the conditions are triggered, but the array can actually be reduced to all zeros.
   - For the seventh test case `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function correctly prints 'NO' because the conditions are triggered and the array cannot be reduced to all zeros.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program does not correctly determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros using the described operations. The conditions checked are insufficient and can lead to incorrect results.
