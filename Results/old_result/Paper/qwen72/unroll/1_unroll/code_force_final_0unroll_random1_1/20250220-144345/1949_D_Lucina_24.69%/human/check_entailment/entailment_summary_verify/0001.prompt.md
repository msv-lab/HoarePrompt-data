You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing a transition video plan. It processes this plan to determine the counts of 'F' (funny) and 'S' (scary) transitions for each row and column. The function then identifies rows and columns that have only 'F' transitions or only 'S' transitions. Based on the counts, it either adds undecided rows and columns to the list of 'F' transitions or to the list of 'S' transitions. Finally, it prints a modified transition video plan where '?' characters are replaced with 'F' or 'S' based on the identified rows and columns. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the integer `n` which represents the number of scenarios.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.
   - It reads the input matrix `xx` which represents the partial transition video plan.

2. **Counting Existing Transitions**:
   - The program iterates through each row of the input matrix.
   - For each character in the row, it increments the corresponding counts in `a` and `b` if the character is 'F' or 'S', respectively.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only One Type of Transition**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - It iterates through each scenario and appends it to `sa` if it has only funny transitions and to `sb` if it has only scary transitions.

4. **Assigning Undecided Transitions**:
   - If the number of scenarios with only funny transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios with only scary transitions (`sb`), the program assigns 'F' to the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'S' to the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sb` and 'F' to the rest.

5. **Outputting the Full Transition Plan**:
   - The program constructs the full transition plan by iterating through each row of the input matrix.
   - For each character in the row, if it is not '?', it is left unchanged.
   - If it is '?', it is replaced with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions determined in the previous step.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry and Consistency**:
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix remains symmetric by reading and writing the matrix in a consistent manner. This is important because the transition from scenario `i` to `j` should be the same as from `j` to `i`.

- **Handling Undecided Transitions**:
  - The program attempts to balance the number of funny and scary transitions by assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions in a way that respects the constraints.
  - However, the logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is not optimal. It only considers the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` and assigns the opposite type to the rest. This approach does not guarantee that no permutation of scenarios will have more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.

- **Constraint Satisfaction**:
  - The program does not explicitly check if the resulting transition plan satisfies the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.
  - The constraint is crucial, and the program's current logic does not ensure it is met for all possible permutations.

### Conclusion:
The program does not guarantee that the resulting transition plan will satisfy the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
