Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take an integer `n` as input, where 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, representing the encoded value of a three-letter word.** 

However, the function definition provided does not include any parameters. To match the problem description, the function should be defined as:

```python
def func(n):
```

With the precondition:
**n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**
