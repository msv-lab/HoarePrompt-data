The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. If `tc` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `tc` is an input integer, and the function should still take two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.

To ensure the loop executes at least once, `tc` must be greater than 0. Since `tc` is an input integer and is related to the number of test cases `t`, we need to ensure that `tc` is at least 1.

State: **`tc` is an input integer and `tc` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer `a_i` in the inner lists satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
