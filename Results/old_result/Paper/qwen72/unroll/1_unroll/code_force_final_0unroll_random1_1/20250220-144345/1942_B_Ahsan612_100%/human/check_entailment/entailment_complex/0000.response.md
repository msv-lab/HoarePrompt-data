### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The goal is to reconstruct a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to n-1 that satisfies the given array `a`.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes an array `res` of length `n` with `None` values.
   - It sets `mex` to `n`, which is the initial value for the MEX of the permutation.
   - It iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `a_i` in `a`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the resulting array `res` for each test case.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The key idea is to reconstruct the permutation `p` by working backwards from the last element to the first.
   - The MEX of the permutation `p` is initially `n` because the permutation contains all integers from 0 to n-1.
   - By iterating in reverse, we can determine the value of `p_i` using the formula `res[i] = mex - ar[i]`.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` ensures that the MEX of the permutation is correctly maintained as we move backwards through the array `a`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - The function also handles the case where `a` contains negative values, as the MEX calculation and the update of `mex` are designed to handle such cases.

5. **Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases are correctly handled by the function:
     - For `n = 5` and `a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the output is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
     - For `n = 5` and `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the output is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - For `n = 3` and `a = [-2, 1, 2]`, the output is `[2, 0, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly reconstructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` for each test case. The logic and the implementation are sound and handle the problem requirements effectively.

**Correctness: **True****
