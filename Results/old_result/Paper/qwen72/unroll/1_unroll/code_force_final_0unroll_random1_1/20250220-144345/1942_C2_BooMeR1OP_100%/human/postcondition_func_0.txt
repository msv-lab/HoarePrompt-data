The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct vertices chosen by Bessie. It then calculates the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen, including Bessie's chosen vertices and additional vertices, to form triangles within the polygon, given the constraints. The function prints the result for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` are re-assigned for each test case, and the final value of `ans` for each test case represents the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen to form triangles.
