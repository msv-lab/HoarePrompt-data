Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to reach his desired final position in the queue. The variable `best` holds the minimum cost for the current test case, and this value is printed for each test case. After all test cases are processed, the loop ends, and no changes are made to the variables `t` or `cases`.**
