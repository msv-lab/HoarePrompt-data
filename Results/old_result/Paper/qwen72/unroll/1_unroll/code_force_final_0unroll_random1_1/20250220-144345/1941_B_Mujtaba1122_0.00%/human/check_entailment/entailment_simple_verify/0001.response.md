### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i > 1 \), \( a_{i-1} > 0 \), and \( a_{i+1} > 0 \).
   - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - However, the current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect. The code:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     is decrementing by the value of \( a_{i-1} \), which is not the correct operation. The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

4. **Correctness of the Operation:**
   - The operation should decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - The current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect because it uses \( a_{i-1} \) as the decrement value, which can lead to incorrect results and potentially make elements negative.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly identifies the state of the program before and after the function calls.
   - However, the annotation for `func_2` is incorrect. The state after the operation should be that the elements at indices \( i-1 \), \( i \), and \( i+1 \) are decremented by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, not by the value of \( a_{i-1} \).

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect because it does not apply the operation correctly.
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made zero is also flawed because it does not handle the case where the operation cannot be applied without making an element negative.
   - A correct implementation would need to ensure that the operation is applied correctly and that no element becomes negative during the process.

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the operation in `func_2`. The operation should decrement the elements by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, and the function should ensure that no element becomes negative during the process. The current implementation does not meet these requirements, leading to incorrect results.
