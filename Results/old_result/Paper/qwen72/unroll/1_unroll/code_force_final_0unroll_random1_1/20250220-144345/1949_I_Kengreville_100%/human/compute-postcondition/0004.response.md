Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, and `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to `None`.**

The code `visited = [False] * n` reinitializes the `visited` list to a list of `False` values of length `n`. Since the initial state already specifies that `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, the output state remains unchanged.
