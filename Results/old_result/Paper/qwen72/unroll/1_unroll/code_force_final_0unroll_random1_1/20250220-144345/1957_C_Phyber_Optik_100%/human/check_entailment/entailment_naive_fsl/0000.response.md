Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where `r = c` correctly. According to the problem description, if `r = c`, the computer skips its turn, but the program does not account for this. Specifically, the program adds both `r` and `c` to the `invalid` set, which would incorrectly mark the column and row as invalid even when the computer skips its turn. This can lead to an incorrect count of valid final configurations.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 1
```
After the first move, the board has a white rook at (1, 1). The computer should skip its turn, but the program incorrectly adds both 1 to the `invalid` set, which would prevent any further valid moves in the first row and first column. This results in an incorrect number of final configurations.
