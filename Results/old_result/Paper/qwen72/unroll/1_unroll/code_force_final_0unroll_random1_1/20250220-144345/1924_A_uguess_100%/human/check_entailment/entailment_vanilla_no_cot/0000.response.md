Correctness: **False**

**Explanation:**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Subsequence Checking:**
   - The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the string `s`, but it does not correctly check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of `s`.
   - The variable `cur` is used to track the presence of characters, but it is reset to 0 every time a complete set of `k` characters is found, which is not the correct approach for checking subsequences.

2. **Incorrect Output for "NO" Case:**
   - When the program determines that not all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, it constructs a string `ans` that is not guaranteed to be a valid non-subsequence string.
   - The construction of `ans` is flawed because it does not ensure that the string is of length `n` and does not check if the constructed string is a valid non-subsequence.

3. **Bitmask Usage:**
   - The bitmask `cur` is used to track the presence of characters, but it is not used to check if a specific string of length `n` is a subsequence of `s`.

4. **Counting Subsequences:**
   - The program counts the number of times a complete set of `k` characters is found in `s`, but this is not the same as counting the number of distinct subsequences of length `n`.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, you should print "NO" and the string that is not a subsequence. If all strings are subsequences, you should print "YES".

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_subsequence(x, s):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def generate_strings(n, k):
    from itertools import product
    return [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        all_strings = generate_strings(n, k)
        for string in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(string, s):
                print('NO')
                print(string)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

**Explanation of the Corrected Program:**

1. **is_subsequence Function:**
   - This function checks if a string `x` is a subsequence of `s` using an iterator and the `all` function.

2. **generate_strings Function:**
   - This function generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets using the `itertools.product` function.

3. **Main Function:**
   - For each test case, it generates all possible strings of length `n` and checks if each string is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, it prints "NO" and the string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, it prints "YES".

This corrected program should correctly solve the problem as described.
