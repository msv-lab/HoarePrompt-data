Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, `s`, which is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters.**

Given the problem description, the function should actually be defined as:
```
def min_pieces_to_sort_binary_string(s):
```

With the precondition:
**s is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**
