The function reads an integer `t` from the user, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) from the user. It then calculates a value `ans` based on `n` and `m` and prints this value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `t` is reduced by the number of test cases processed, and the last values of `n` and `m` read from the user are retained. The variable `ans` is recalculated and printed for each test case, and it does not persist between test cases.
