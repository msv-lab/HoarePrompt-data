### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.

2. **Array Conversion**:
   - The program converts the input array into a string `arr` by joining the elements and removing spaces. This is a valid step as it simplifies the subsequent operations.

3. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - The program finds the index of the first chip (`x`) using `arr.find('1')`.
   - The program finds the index of the last chip from the right (`y`) using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the left.

4. **Extracting the Subarray**:
   - The program extracts the subarray `z` that contains all the chips and the free cells between them using `arr[x:n - y]`. This is correct because `x` is the index of the first chip and `n - y` is the index of the last chip (since `y` is the index from the right).

5. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - The program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')`. This is the correct approach because the number of free cells between the first and last chip is the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The steps are logically sound and the operations are performed correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
