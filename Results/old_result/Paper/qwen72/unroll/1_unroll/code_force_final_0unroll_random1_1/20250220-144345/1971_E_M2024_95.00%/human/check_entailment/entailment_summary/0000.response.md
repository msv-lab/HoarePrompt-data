Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Test Case Loop**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the sequences `a` and `b`, which represent the positions and times of the signs, respectively.
   - The sequences `a` and `b` are prepended with a 0 to handle the starting point at 0.

2. **Speed Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the distances `ad` between consecutive points in `a`.
   - It calculates the time differences `bd` between consecutive times in `b`.
   - It then calculates the speeds `v` for each segment between the signs.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query `d`, the function uses `bisect_left` to find the segment in which the query point `d` lies.
   - If `d` is exactly at a sign point, it prints the corresponding time from `b`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the time to reach `d` by:
     - Subtracting the position of the previous sign from `d`.
     - Adding the time taken to reach the previous sign.
     - Adding the time taken to travel the remaining distance at the speed of the current segment.
   - The result is rounded down to the nearest integer using `int(m)`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `d` is 0 by printing `0`.
   - It also handles the case where `d` is exactly at a sign point by directly using the time from `b`.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The use of `bisect_left` ensures that the function efficiently finds the correct segment for each query, which is crucial given the constraints on `k` and `q`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function prints the results for each query in the correct format, with each result separated by a space and each test case's results on a new line.

Based on the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the edge cases and efficiently processes the queries.

Correctness: **True**
