Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second to the last element. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})
\]

To maximize this sum, we should maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative differences. The optimal way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order. When the array is sorted, the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, and the sum of these differences is maximized.

However, the given program does not compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Instead, it computes the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the sorted array and prints that value. This is incorrect because the maximum beauty is not simply the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, but the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted array.

To correct the program, we should compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            beauty += a[i] - a[i-1]
        
        print(beauty)
```

Given the current program, it does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
