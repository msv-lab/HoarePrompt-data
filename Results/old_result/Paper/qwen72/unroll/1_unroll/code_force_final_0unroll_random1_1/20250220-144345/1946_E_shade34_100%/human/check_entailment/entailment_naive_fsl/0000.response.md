Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not directly address the problem description. The problem requires a function to count the number of different permutations of a given length that could have been guessed based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. However, the provided functions seem to be related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is not relevant to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
