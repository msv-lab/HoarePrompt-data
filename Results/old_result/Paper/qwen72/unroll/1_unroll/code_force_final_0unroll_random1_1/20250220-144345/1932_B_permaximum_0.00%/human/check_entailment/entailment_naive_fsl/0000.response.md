Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the line `year += year % ai or ai` does not ensure that the signs occur strictly after the previous sign. For example, if the input is `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`, the program will calculate the year as follows:

1. For `a1 = 3`, `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
2. For `a2 = 2`, `year = 3 + 0 = 3` (since `3 % 2 == 1` and `1 or 2` evaluates to `1`, but the correct year should be `4`).
3. For `a3 = 4`, `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `4 % 4 == 0` and `0 or 4` evaluates to `4`, but the correct year should be `8`).
4. For `a4 = 5`, `year = 4 + 1 = 5` (since `5 % 5 == 0` and `0 or 5` evaluates to `5`, but the correct year should be `10`).
5. For `a5 = 9`, `year = 5 + 4 = 9` (since `9 % 9 == 0` and `0 or 9` evaluates to `9`, but the correct year should be `18`).
6. For `a6 = 18`, `year = 9 + 9 = 18` (since `18 % 18 == 0` and `0 or 18` evaluates to `18`, but the correct year should be `36`).

The program fails to correctly compute the year for the second and subsequent signs, as it does not account for the requirement that the signs must occur strictly after the previous sign. The correct approach would involve finding the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current year.
