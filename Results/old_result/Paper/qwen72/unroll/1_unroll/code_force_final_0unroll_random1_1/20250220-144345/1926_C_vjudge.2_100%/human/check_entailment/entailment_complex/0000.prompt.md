Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case.
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [(0) for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
        
    #State: `pd` is a list of length 200001 where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < 200001) is the sum of all the digits of the integers from 1 to i, inclusive, and the cumulative sum of the previous elements in the list.
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(pd[n])
        
    #State: The list `pd` remains unchanged, and the loop prints the value of `pd[n]` for each iteration based on the input `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from user input. The function precomputes a list `pd` of length 200001, where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < 200001) is the sum of all the digits of the integers from 1 to i, inclusive, plus the cumulative sum of the previous elements in the list. After precomputation, the function prints the value of `pd[n]` for each test case. The list `pd` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
