You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person and the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.

            else:
                custo += b_values[y]

            if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
                custo += b_values[y]
                if y == 1:

                    break
            else:
                custo += a_values[y]
                break
        
        custos.append(custo)
        
    #State: `custos` is a list containing the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe his way to a position no greater than `m` for each of the `t` test cases. The length of `custos` is equal to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `x` are not directly modified by the loop, but `a_values` and `b_values` are populated from input for each test case.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: The values of `custos` are printed one by one, and the state of `custos` remains unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `x` are also unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in the queue `n`, the maximum allowable final position `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` representing the costs to bribe individuals. It returns the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
