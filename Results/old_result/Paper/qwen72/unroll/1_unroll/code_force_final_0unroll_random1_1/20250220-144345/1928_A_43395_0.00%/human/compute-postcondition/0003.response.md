The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b` that represent the dimensions of a rectangle. The inputs `a` and `b` for each test case satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function should be able to handle up to 10^4 test cases. However, the provided function signature does not specify the parameters or the return value, which makes it unclear how the function is intended to be used. Assuming the function is meant to return the area of the rectangle for each test case, the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It returns the area of the rectangle for each test case. If the function is designed to handle up to 10^4 test cases, it should return a list of areas corresponding to each test case.**
