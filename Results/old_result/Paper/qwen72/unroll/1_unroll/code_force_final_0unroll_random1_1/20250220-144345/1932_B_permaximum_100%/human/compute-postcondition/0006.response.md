Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of `t` test cases, each containing a list of integers. It returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the smallest year greater than or equal to 0 that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case. The function does not modify the input parameters `t` or `test_cases`. After the function concludes, the `results` list contains the computed years for each test case. **
