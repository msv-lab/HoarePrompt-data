The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from input. The function then calculates the largest integer `ans` such that `x - n * ans` is divisible by `ans` and is non-negative. After processing all test cases, the function prints the value of `ans` for each test case. The values of `x` and `n` are updated for each test case, and the final state of the program includes the last values of `x` and `n` read from input, and the last calculated value of `ans` for that test case. The function does not return any value.
