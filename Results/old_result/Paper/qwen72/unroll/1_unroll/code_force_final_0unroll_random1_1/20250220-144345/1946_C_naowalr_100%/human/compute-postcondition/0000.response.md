The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, and the expression `int(sys.stdin.readline())` determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the expression `int(sys.stdin.readline())` must evaluate to a positive integer (greater than 0). This means that the input read from `sys.stdin` must be a string that can be converted to an integer greater than 0.

State: **`int(sys.stdin.readline())` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
