Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year when the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of the signs. The key logic in the program is in the `func_1` function, where it calculates the year for each sign to occur sequentially, starting from year 0.

### Explanation of the `func_1` function:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.
   - For each test case, `n` and `a` are extracted, where `n` is the number of signs and `a` is the list of periodicities.

2. **Year Calculation**:
   - `current_year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the program calculates the next year when the sign will occur:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next year is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which is the smallest multiple of `ai` greater than `current_year`.

3. **Result Collection**:
   - After processing all signs for a test case, `current_year` is appended to the `results` list.
   - The function returns the `results` list containing the years for each test case.

### Verification with Example Test Cases:
- **Test Case 1**: `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Start: `current_year = 0`
  - 1st sign: `current_year = 3`
  - 2nd sign: `current_year = 4`
  - 3rd sign: `current_year = 8`
  - 4th sign: `current_year = 10`
  - 5th sign: `current_year = 18`
  - 6th sign: `current_year = 36`
  - Output: `36` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2**: `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Start: `current_year = 0`
  - 1st sign: `current_year = 1`
  - 2nd sign: `current_year = 2`
  - 3rd sign: `current_year = 3`
  - 4th sign: `current_year = 4`
  - 5th sign: `current_year = 5`
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3**: `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Start: `current_year = 0`
  - 1st sign: `current_year = 1`
  - 2nd sign: `current_year = 2`
  - 3rd sign: `current_year = 3`
  - 4th sign: `current_year = 4`
  - 5th sign: `current_year = 5`
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 4**: `a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Start: `current_year = 0`
  - 1st sign: `current_year = 50`
  - 2nd sign: `current_year = 60`
  - 3rd sign: `current_year = 711`
  - 4th sign: `current_year = 800`
  - 5th sign: `current_year = 1006`
  - 6th sign: `current_year = 2012`
  - Output: `2012` (Correct)

The program correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs and calculates the smallest year when the n-th sign will occur for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.
