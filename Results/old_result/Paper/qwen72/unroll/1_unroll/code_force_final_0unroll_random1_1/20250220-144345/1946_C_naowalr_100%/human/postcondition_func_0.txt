The function `func_1` reads an integer from `sys.stdin`, which specifies the number of times the `solve` function will be called. For each iteration, it reads a set of input data (the specifics of which are not provided) and calls the `solve` function with that data. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. After the function concludes, the `solve` function has been called the number of times specified by the integer read from `sys.stdin`, and the initial state of any variables outside the function remains unchanged.
