### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input by reading the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting them to integers.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - The program starts by calculating the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`.

3. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Positions:**
   - After reaching the `max_p` position, the program continues to calculate the cost for Kirill to move further up the queue.
   - It iterates from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue in reverse order.
   - For each position `y`, it checks if the cost to move to the next position (`a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]`) is less than or equal to the cost to stay at the current position (`a_values[y]`).
   - If the condition is met, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost and, if `y` is 1, it also adds `a_values[0]` (the cost to move to the first position).
   - If the condition is not met, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost and breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total cost `custo` to the `custos` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in the `custos` list.

### Analysis:
- The program's logic is designed to minimize the cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` people.
- The initial cost calculation is correct for positions from `num_fila` to `max_p`.
- The subsequent cost calculation for positions from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue is also correct, as it ensures that Kirill moves to the optimal position with the minimum cost.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `max_p` is 1 correctly. If `max_p` is 1, Kirill should only consider the cost to move to the first position, which is `a_values[0]`.
- The logic for the second loop (from `max_p - 1` to the beginning) might not always find the optimal solution, especially if the costs are not uniformly distributed.

### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is mostly correct, but it has a potential issue with handling the case where `max_p` is 1.
- The second loop's logic might not always find the optimal solution, leading to incorrect results in some edge cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has issues with handling the case where `max_p` is 1 and might not always find the optimal solution for the second loop. These issues can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.
