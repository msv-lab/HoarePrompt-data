Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the shape is an upside-down triangle. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
4
0000
1110
0100
0000
```

This input represents an upside-down triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because it only checks the first two rows of the grid for the number of '1's. Since the first two rows have different counts of '1's, it will print "TRIANGLE" instead of "SQUARE". However, the correct output should be "TRIANGLE" because the shape is an upside-down triangle. The program fails to account for this specific case, making it incorrect.
