You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers of length n, and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: The loop will return False if any element in the list is not 0. If all elements in the list are 0, the loop will complete all iterations without returning, and the state of the list and n will remain unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and a positive integer `n` representing the length of the list. It checks if all elements in the list are 0. If any element is not 0, the function returns `False`. If all elements are 0, the function returns `True`. The state of the list and `n` remains unchanged.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of non-negative integers, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list).
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: list[0] to list[n-2] are 0, and list[n-1] and beyond are unchanged.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: *list[0] to list[n-2] are 0, and list[n-1] and beyond are unchanged. If `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`, the function `func_1` evaluated on `list` and `n` returns `True`. Otherwise, `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer `n` where 3 <= n <= len(list). It modifies the list such that elements from index 0 to index n-2 are set to 0, while elements from index n-1 onwards remain unchanged. The function then evaluates `func_1(list, n)` and prints 'YES' if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The final state of the program is that the list has been modified as described, and the output is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the evaluation of `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation. The operation involves choosing an index \( i \) (where \( 2 \le i \le n-1 \)) and decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function 1: `func_1(list, n)`**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct and serves its purpose.

3. **Function 2: `func_2(list, n)`**
   - This function attempts to apply the operation to the list.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to \( n-2 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it checks if \( a_i > 1 \), \( a_{i-1} > 0 \), and \( a_{i+1} > 0 \).
   - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation by decrementing \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - However, the way the operation is applied is incorrect. The code:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
     list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
     ```
     is decrementing by the value of \( a_{i-1} \), which is not the correct operation. The correct operation should be:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```

4. **Correctness of the Operation:**
   - The operation should decrement \( a_{i-1} \), \( a_i \), and \( a_{i+1} \) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - The current implementation in `func_2` is incorrect because it uses \( a_{i-1} \) as the decrement value, which can lead to incorrect results.

5. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation would involve decrementing the elements by the correct values:
     ```python
     list[i - 1] -= 1
     list[i] -= 2
     list[i + 1] -= 1
     ```
   - Additionally, the function should check if the operation can be applied without making any element negative. If any element becomes negative, it should return `NO`.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect because it does not apply the operation correctly.
   - The logic for checking if the array can be made zero is also flawed because it does not handle the case where the operation cannot be applied without making an element negative.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the operation in `func_2`. The operation should decrement the elements by 1, 2, and 1 respectively, and the function should ensure that no element becomes negative during the process.
