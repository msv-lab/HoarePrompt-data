You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence of the sequence sums to `k`.
     - For all integers `v` in the range `[1, n]` where `v` is not equal to `k`, there exists a subsequence that sums to `v`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_7**: Reads two integers `n` and `k` from input.
   - **func_14**: Generates the sequence based on the given `n` and `k`.
   - **func_15**: Handles multiple test cases by calling `func_14` for each test case.

3. **func_14 Analysis**:
   - **Binary Representation**:
     - The function converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations.
     - `b` is the binary representation of `n`.
     - `bk` is the binary representation of `k`.
     - `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.

   - **Special Case for `k == 1`**:
     - If `k == 1`, the function handles it separately:
       - If `n == 2`, the sequence is `[2]`.
       - Otherwise, the sequence starts with `[2, 3]` and continues with powers of 2 up to the length of `b`.

   - **General Case for `k > 1`**:
     - The function constructs the sequence `ans`:
       - It includes powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-1)`.
       - It appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence is just below `k`.
       - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure that `k` cannot be formed by any subsequence.
       - It continues with powers of 2 from `2^(lk)` to `2^(l-1)`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
     - The sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing elements and ensuring the sum of the sequence is just below `k` and then adding elements that are too large to form `k` with any combination.
   - **Subsequences for All `v` in `[1, n]` where `v != k`**:
     - The sequence includes powers of 2, which can form any sum up to `2^l - 1` (where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`).
     - By including `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`, it ensures that all sums up to `n` can be formed except `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `k == 1` correctly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence size does not exceed 25 by carefully selecting elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. It avoids forming a subsequence that sums to `k` while ensuring that all other sums up to `n` can be formed.

Correctness: **True**
