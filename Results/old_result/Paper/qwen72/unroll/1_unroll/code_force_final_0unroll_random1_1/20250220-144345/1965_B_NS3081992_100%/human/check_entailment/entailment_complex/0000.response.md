### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - `func_14()` reads `n` and `k` for each test case and generates the required sequence.

2. **Generating the Sequence:**
   - **Case 1: `k == 1`**
     - If `n == 2`, the function returns `1\n2` which is correct.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence `ans` starting with `[2, 3]` and then appends powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`.
     - This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences of `ans`.

   - **Case 2: `k != 1`**
     - The function constructs a sequence `ans` starting with powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k`.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, `k + 1`, and `2 * k + 1` to `ans`.
     - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from \(2^{lk-1}\) to \(2^{l-1}\) to `ans`.
     - This ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`, and all other values from 1 to `n` can be formed by subsequences of `ans`.

3. **Output:**
   - `func_15()` calls `func_14()` for each test case and writes the output to the standard output.

### Analysis:
- The sequence generated by `func_14()` meets the problem requirements:
  - **No subsequence sums to `k`:**
    - For `k == 1`, the sequence starts with 2 and 3, and subsequent elements are powers of 2, which ensures no subsequence sums to 1.
    - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing elements and ensuring the sum of the first part of the sequence is less than `k`.
  - **All other values from 1 to `n` can be formed:**
    - The sequence includes powers of 2, which can be combined to form any value up to the sum of the sequence.
    - Additional elements like `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensure that values close to `k` can be formed without including `k` itself.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence for each test case that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
