Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing a transition video plan. It processes this plan to determine the counts of 'F' (funny) and 'S' (scary) transitions for each row and column. The function then identifies rows and columns that have only 'F' transitions or only 'S' transitions. Based on the counts, it either adds undecided rows and columns to the list of 'F' transitions or to the list of 'S' transitions. Finally, it prints a modified transition video plan where '?' characters are replaced with 'F' or 'S' based on the identified rows and columns. The function does not return any value. **
