Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the cities are such that the closest city is not unique for some city. The problem description explicitly states that for every city, the closest city is determined uniquely. However, the function `func_1` in the provided program does not ensure this uniqueness. For example, consider the cities located at points [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. According to the problem, the closest city to city 2 (located at point 1) should be unique, but in this case, both city 1 (0) and city 3 (2) are equally close to city 2. The program will incorrectly assign a closest city in such scenarios, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

Additionally, the program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. The logic in `func_1` is flawed, and the prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are not being used correctly to determine the minimum cost. For instance, in the example provided, the program should calculate the minimum cost by considering the option to travel to the closest city for 1 coin, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.
