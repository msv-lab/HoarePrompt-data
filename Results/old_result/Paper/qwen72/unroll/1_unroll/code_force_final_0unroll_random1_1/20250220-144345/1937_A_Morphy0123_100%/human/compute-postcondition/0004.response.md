Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. If `n` is exactly a power of 2, it prints the next power of 2. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external variables. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes. **
