Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed, specifically in the line `year += year % ai or ai`. This line is intended to increment the year by the periodicity of the current sign if the current year is not a multiple of the periodicity. However, it does not correctly handle the sequential waiting for signs as described in the problem.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            # Find the next year when the sign occurs, strictly after the current year
            year = (year // ai + 1) * ai
        print(year)
```

This corrected version ensures that the year is updated to the next multiple of `ai` that is strictly after the current year, which aligns with the problem's requirement that the signs must occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.
