Output State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than the length of the list, and the length of `arr` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5. `nums` is a Counter object that contains the frequency count of each integer in `arr`. `start` is 0. `vis` is an empty set.** 

The code initializes an empty set `vis`. The other variables `arr`, `nums`, and `start` remain unchanged from their initial state.
