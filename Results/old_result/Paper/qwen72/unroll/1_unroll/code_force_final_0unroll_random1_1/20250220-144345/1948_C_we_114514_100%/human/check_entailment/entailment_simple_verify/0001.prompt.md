You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it cannot skip a move or go outside the grid.
   - After each move, the robot must follow the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Breaking Down `func_1`:**
   - The function first calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the grid (excluding the last column of the first half).
   - For each column `i` in the first half, it checks if the arrow in the cell (1, 2*i+1) points left (`'<')` and if either the arrow in the cell (2, 2*i) or (2, 2*i+2) points left (`'<')`.
     - If both conditions are met, the robot cannot move past this column, and the function returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the arrow in the cell (1, n-1) points left (`'<')` and if the arrow in the cell (2, n-2) points left (`'<')`.
     - If both conditions are met, the robot cannot reach the last column, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Validating the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to check if there are any obstacles that prevent the robot from moving to the right and eventually reaching the last column.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving to the right without getting stuck.
   - The conditions in the loop and the final check are sufficient to ensure that the robot can reach the target cell if there are no such obstacles.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 2, which is the smallest possible value for `n`.
   - The function also handles the general case where `n` is larger and even, as specified in the problem constraints.

6. **Input and Output:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description and constraints. The reasoning and checks in `func_1` are valid, and `func_2` processes the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
