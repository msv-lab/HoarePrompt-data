You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    k -= 1
    print(func_1(l))

def func_1(a):
    x = a[k]
    ind = []
    c = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] > x:
            ind.append(i)
            c += 1
        if c == 2:
            break
    if k == 14:
        print(ind)
    if ind == []:
        return n - 1
    if len(ind) == 1:
        if ind[0] == 0:
            return k - 1
        if ind[0] > k:
            return ind[0] - 1
        return max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)
    if ind[0] == 0:
        return min(ind[1] - 1, k - 1)
    if k > ind[1]:
        return max(ind[0] - 1, ind[1] - ind[0])
    return max(ind[0] - 1, k - ind[0])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes a list `a` of unique integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and an integer `k` (not explicitly passed as a parameter but assumed to be available in the function scope). It returns an integer based on the following conditions:
1. If no elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`.
2. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is not 0, it returns the index of that element minus 1.
3. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
4. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is greater than `k`, it returns the index of that element minus 1.
5. If exactly one element in `a` is greater than `a[k]` and its index is less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum of `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`.
6. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and the first index is 0, it returns the minimum of the second index minus 1 and `k - 1`.
7. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is greater than the second index, it returns the maximum of the first index minus 1 and the difference between the second and first indices.
8. If two elements in `a` are greater than `a[k]` and `k` is less than or equal to the second index, it returns the maximum of the first index minus 1 and `k - ind[0]`.

Additionally, if `k` is 14, the function prints the list `ind` containing the indices of the first two elements in `a` that are greater than `a[14]` (or all such elements if fewer than two).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it does not consider the optimal swap position for the cow with index `k` to maximize the number of wins. Here is a case where the program fails:

Input:
```
1
5 2
5 3 1 4 2
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

Actual Output:
```
1
```

Explanation:
- In the given input, the cow with index `k = 2` (0-based index) has a rating of `3`.
- The optimal strategy is to swap the cow with index `2` (rating `3`) with the cow at index `3` (rating `4`).
- After the swap, the list becomes: `5, 4, 1, 3, 2`.
- The matches would proceed as follows:
  - Match 1: `5` vs `4` → `5` wins.
  - Match 2: `5` vs `1` → `5` wins.
  - Match 3: `5` vs `3` → `5` wins.
  - Match 4: `5` vs `2` → `5` wins.
- The cow with rating `3` wins 2 matches (against `1` and `2`).

However, the provided program does not correctly identify this optimal swap and returns `1` instead of `2`.

This indicates that the program is not correctly handling the logic to find the maximum number of wins for the cow with index `k` by considering all possible swap positions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
