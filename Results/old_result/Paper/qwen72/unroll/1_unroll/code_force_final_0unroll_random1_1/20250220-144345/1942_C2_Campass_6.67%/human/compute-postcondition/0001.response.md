Output State: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, `n` is the number of sides of a regular polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), `y` is the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), `t` is the first integer from the input split by spaces, and `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` are provided, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**
