Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program has a logical error that can lead to incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the line `b += c` is problematic because it assumes that all universals can be used to fulfill the requirements of extroverts, which is not always the case. 

Here is a counterexample:
- Input: `1 2 1`
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `2`

Explanation of the counterexample:
- There is 1 introvert, 2 extroverts, and 1 universal.
- The introvert needs 1 tent.
- The 2 extroverts need a tent with exactly 3 people, but there is only 1 universal, which means it is impossible to form a tent with 3 people for the extroverts.
- Therefore, the correct output should be `-1`, but the program outputs `2`.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of universals is insufficient to form the required tents for extroverts.
