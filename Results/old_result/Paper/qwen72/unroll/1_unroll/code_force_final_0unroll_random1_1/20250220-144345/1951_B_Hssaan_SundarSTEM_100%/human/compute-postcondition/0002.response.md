The function `func` accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, representing a specific index or value within the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and all a_i are distinct, representing the input list of integers.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. However, given the constraints and the typical nature of such functions, it is likely that the function processes the list `a` in some way related to the parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `k` is a specific index or value within the list `a`, and `a` is a list of distinct integers. The function returns a result based on these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided.**
