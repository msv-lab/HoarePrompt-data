### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a problemset of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which will store the maximum balance found.
   - It iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
   - If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, it means `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each having a difficulty of `i` and the remaining difficulty can be evenly distributed among the sub-problems. In this case, `i` is a valid balance, and `ans` is updated to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` to see if `x // i` can be a valid balance.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum balance found for each test case.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`, which is an efficient way to find divisors.
   - The conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensure that the remaining difficulty can be evenly distributed among the sub-problems, making `i` a valid balance.
   - The conditions `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` similarly ensure that `x // i` can be a valid balance.
   - The program updates `ans` to the maximum of the current `ans` and the valid balances found.
   - The program prints the correct output for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description and constraints.
