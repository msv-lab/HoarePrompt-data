Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. The function then determines and prints the maximum number of elements in the list `s` that can be made non-decreasing by performing one or two specific swaps: either swapping the first element with the `k`-th element, or swapping the first element with the `k`-th element and then swapping the element at position `p` (determined during the process) with the `k`-th element. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `s` remain unchanged after the function concludes. **
