The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `n`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3.
- `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8.
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x.

The function returns a value based on these parameters, but the specific output is not provided in the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept these three integer parameters and return a value that is determined by the relationship between `t`, `x`, and `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `t`, `x`, and `n` where 1 <= t <= 10^3, 1 <= x <= 10^8, and 1 <= n <= x, and returns a value based on the relationship between these parameters.**
