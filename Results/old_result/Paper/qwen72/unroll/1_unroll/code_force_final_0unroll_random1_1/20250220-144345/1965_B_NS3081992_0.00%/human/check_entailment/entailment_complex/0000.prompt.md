Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k . Find a sequence a of non-negative
integers of size at most 25 such that the following conditions hold.

  * There is no subsequence of a with a sum of k . 
  * For all 1 \le v \le n where v \ne k , there is a subsequence of a with a sum of v . 

A sequence b is a subsequence of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion
of several (possibly, zero or all) elements, without changing the order of the
remaining elements. For example, [5, 2, 3] is a subsequence of [1, 5, 7, 8, 2,
4, 3] .

It can be shown that under the given constraints, a solution always exists.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers n and k (2
\le n \le 10^6 , 1 \le k \le n ) — the parameters described above.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^7 .

Output

The first line of output for each test case should contain a single integer m
(1 \le m \le 25 ) — the size of your chosen sequence.

The second line of output for each test case should contain m integers a_i (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of your chosen sequence.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    6 1
    
    8 8
    
    9 3
    
    10 7

Output

    1
    1
    5
    2 3 4 5 6
    7
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    4
    7 1 4 1
    4
    1 2 8 3
    
Note

In the first example, we just need a subsequence that adds up to 1 , but not
one that adds up to 2 . So the array a=[1] suffices.

In the second example, all elements are greater than k=1 , so no subsequence
adds up to 1 . Every other integer between 1 and n is present in the array, so
there is a subsequence of size 1 adding up to each of those numbers.

    #State: The dictionary `d` remains unchanged. The list `processing` will have some of its elements set to 1 at the indices corresponding to the elements in `d[da]` minus 1, but these elements will be reset to 0 by the end of the loop. The list `rank` remains unchanged. The variable `tmp` will be updated to the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts a dictionary `d`, a list `processing`, an integer `da`, and a list `rank`. It returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has only one element. Otherwise, it updates the `processing` list by temporarily setting certain elements to 1 and then resetting them to 0. The function also updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by recursive calls to `func_12` plus 1. Finally, the function returns this updated value.

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns `y`, `x - (a // b) * y`, and `g`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two integers `a` and `b`, where `b` is not zero. It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `a * x + b * y = g`. In the base case, when `b` is zero, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. In the recursive case, it returns `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)`, where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the results of the recursive call `func_13(b, a % b)`.

If `k` is 1 and `n` is not equal to 2, `ans` is a list containing [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(l-1), and `n`, `k`, `b`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged.

Here, `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_14` takes no parameters and returns a string. The function internally uses the values of `n` and `k` obtained from the function `func_7()`, where `n` and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. If `k` is 1 and `n` is 2, the function returns the string '1\n2'. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, the function returns a space-separated string of the sequence [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)], where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. If `k` is not 1, the function returns a space-separated string of the sequence [1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^(l-1)], where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, but the function is expected to interact with other functions (`func_10` and `func_14`) that are not defined in the provided code snippet.

    #State: Output State: The loop will execute `func_10()` times, and during each iteration, it will call `func_14()` and print its return value followed by a newline. The exact output state cannot be determined without knowing the definitions of `func_10` and `func_14`, but the loop will have printed the return values of `func_14()` for each iteration, each on a new line. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_15` does not accept any parameters. It executes a loop a number of times equal to the value returned by `func_10()`. During each iteration of the loop, it calls `func_14()` and prints the return value of `func_14()` followed by a newline character. The function does not modify any variables outside of its scope. After the function concludes, the output will consist of the return values of `func_14()`, each printed on a new line, for a total of `func_10()` iterations.
