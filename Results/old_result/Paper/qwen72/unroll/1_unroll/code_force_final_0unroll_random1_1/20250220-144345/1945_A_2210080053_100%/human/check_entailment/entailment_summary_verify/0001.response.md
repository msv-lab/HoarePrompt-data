### Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**:
   - The program correctly reads input from `open(0)`, which is a way to read from standard input in Python.
   - The first line is skipped ( `[1:]` ), and each subsequent line is processed as a test case.
   - Each line is split into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Logic for Tents**:
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b` to account for the flexibility of universals.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents needed:
     - `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents that can be filled by extroverts and universals.
     - `- -b // 3` is equivalent to `b // 3` because the double negative cancels out.
     - `a + b // 3` is the total number of tents needed if all extroverts and universals can be accommodated in groups of three.
   - The expression `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents:
     - `b % 3` gives the remainder when `b` is divided by 3, which represents the number of additional people needed to fill the last tent.
     - If `c` (the number of universals) is less than `b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to fill the last tent, and the program outputs `-1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case.
   - If it is possible to accommodate all participants, it prints the number of tents.
   - If it is impossible, it prints `-1`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- **Introverts**: Each introvert needs a separate tent, so `a` tents are required for introverts.
- **Extroverts and Universals**: Extroverts need to be in groups of three. If there are not enough universals to fill the last tent, the program correctly outputs `-1`.
- **Universals**: Universals can fill any remaining spots, so they are added to the extroverts to maximize the use of tents.

### Potential Issues:
- The expression `a - -b // 3` is mathematically equivalent to `a + b // 3`, but it is not the most readable or intuitive way to write it. This could be simplified to `a + b // 3` for better clarity.
- The program does not handle the edge case where `b` is zero and `c` is less than `a` (all introverts and no extroverts). However, this edge case is not relevant because the problem states that each introvert must have a separate tent, and the number of introverts `a` is already accounted for in the final tent count.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the main logic of accommodating introverts, extroverts, and universals.
- The expression `a - -b // 3` is functionally correct but could be simplified to `a + b // 3` for better readability.
- The program does not have any logical errors that would cause it to produce incorrect results for valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct in its logic and handles all the given test cases correctly. The minor issue with readability does not affect the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program is fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
