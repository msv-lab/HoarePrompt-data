### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob has a rectangle of size \( a \times b \).
   - He can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of the sides.
   - He then tries to form a new rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.
   - The new rectangle is considered different if it is not a 90-degree rotation of the original rectangle.

2. **Conditions for Forming a New Rectangle:**
   - If \( a \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles.
   - If \( b \) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles.
   - For the new rectangle to be different, the dimensions of the new rectangle formed by combining the two smaller rectangles must not be the same as the original dimensions \( a \times b \) or \( b \times a \).

3. **Analyzing the Program:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \) of the rectangle.
   - It checks if either \( a \) or \( b \) is even:
     - If \( a \) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles and checks if \( \frac{a}{2} \neq b \). If true, it prints "Yes".
     - If \( b \) is even, it cuts the rectangle into two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles and checks if \( \frac{b}{2} \neq a \). If true, it prints "Yes".
   - If neither \( a \) nor \( b \) is even, it prints "No".

4. **Verification of Conditions:**
   - If \( a \) is even, the new rectangle formed by combining the two \( \frac{a}{2} \times b \) rectangles will have dimensions \( a \times b \) or \( \frac{a}{2} \times 2b \). For it to be different, \( \frac{a}{2} \) must not equal \( b \).
   - If \( b \) is even, the new rectangle formed by combining the two \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) rectangles will have dimensions \( a \times b \) or \( 2a \times \frac{b}{2} \). For it to be different, \( \frac{b}{2} \) must not equal \( a \).
   - If both \( a \) and \( b \) are odd, it is impossible to form a new rectangle that is different from the original because any cut will result in two rectangles that, when combined, will either be the same as the original or a 90-degree rotation of it.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where both \( a \) and \( b \) are 1, which is the smallest possible rectangle and cannot be cut.
   - The program also correctly handles cases where one dimension is 1 and the other is even, which can form a new rectangle.

### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code confirms that the program reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case by reading the dimensions \( a \) and \( b \).
- The program checks if \( a \) or \( b \) is even and performs the necessary checks to determine if a new rectangle can be formed.
- The annotations also confirm that the values of \( a \) and \( b \) are overwritten in each iteration, and the loop continues until all test cases are processed.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can form a new rectangle from the given \( a \times b \) rectangle. It checks the necessary conditions and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
