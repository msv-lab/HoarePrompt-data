Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `test_cases` is a list of t lists, where each inner list contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6), `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list called `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The list `results` is now ready to store the results of the test cases.
