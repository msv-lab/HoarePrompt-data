Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is consistent with the problem description. However, the function does not take any parameters, which is not ideal but not incorrect since it reads input directly.

2. **Input Handling**: The function reads an integer `n` to determine the number of test cases, and then iterates `n` times, reading a string `s` for each test case. This is correct and aligns with the problem description.

3. **Distinct Character Check**: The function checks if the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters using `set(s)`. If `len(a) == 2`, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because if a string has exactly two distinct characters, it is impossible to rearrange it to form a new string that is not equal to the original.

4. **Lexicographical Sorting**: If the string `s` contains more than two distinct characters, the function prints 'YES'. It then sorts the string `s` to create the lexicographically smallest version (`b`) and the largest version (`c`). This is correct and aligns with the problem's requirement to output a rearranged string that is not equal to the original.

5. **Output Logic**: The function checks if the lexicographically smallest version (`b`) is equal to the original string `s`. If it is, it prints the lexicographically largest version (`c`). Otherwise, it prints the smallest version (`b`). This logic ensures that the output string is different from the original string `s`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as strings with all identical characters (e.g., "aaaaa") and strings with exactly two distinct characters (e.g., "xxxxy").

7. **Output Format**: The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the rearranged string, which matches the required output format.

However, there is a minor issue in the logic for handling strings with exactly two distinct characters. The function should print 'NO' if the string contains exactly one distinct character (i.e., all characters are the same), not exactly two. This is a critical error because it misinterprets the condition for impossibility.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) <= 1:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
```

Given the original code, the correctness is **False** due to the incorrect condition for printing 'NO'.

Correctness: **False**
