### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The robot starts at cell (1, 1) and must reach cell (2, n).
   - The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but it cannot skip a move or go outside the grid.
   - After each move, the robot must follow the arrow in the current cell.

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).
   - The function `func_2` reads the input and processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Breaking Down `func_1`:**
   - The function first calculates `half_n` as `n // 2`.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the grid (excluding the last column of the first half).
   - For each column `i` in the first half, it checks if the arrow in the cell (1, 2*i+1) points left (`'<')` and if either the arrow in the cell (2, 2*i) or (2, 2*i+2) points left (`'<')`.
     - If both conditions are met, the robot cannot move past this column, and the function returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the arrow in the cell (1, n-1) points left (`'<')` and if the arrow in the cell (2, n-2) points left (`'<')`.
     - If both conditions are met, the robot cannot reach the last column, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

4. **Validating the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to check if there are any obstacles that prevent the robot from moving to the right and eventually reaching the last column.
   - Specifically, it checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving to the right without getting stuck.
   - The conditions in the loop and the final check are sufficient to ensure that the robot can reach the target cell if there are no such obstacles.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 2, which is the smallest possible value for `n`.
   - The function also handles the general case where `n` is larger and even, as specified in the problem constraints.

6. **Input and Output:**
   - `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - It collects the results and prints them in the required format.

### Challenging the Logic:
- **Potential Issue:**
  - The function `func_1` only checks specific conditions for obstacles but does not consider all possible paths the robot can take. For example, it does not check if the robot can move from the second row to the first row and then continue moving to the right.
  - The function assumes that the robot must always move from the first row to the second row and then continue to the right, which might not be the case. The robot could also move from the second row to the first row and then continue to the right.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1:**
  - `n = 4`
  - `row1 = ">><<"`
  - `row2 = ">>><"`
  - The robot can follow the path: (1, 1) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 4).
  - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.

- **Example 2:**
  - `n = 2`
  - `row1 = "><"`
  - `row2 = "><"`
  - The robot can follow the path: (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2).
  - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.

- **Example 3:**
  - `n = 4`
  - `row1 = ">>><"`
  - `row2 = ">><<"`
  - The robot cannot reach (2, 4) because it gets stuck at (1, 3) or (2, 3) due to the arrows.
  - The function correctly returns 'No'.

- **Example 4:**
  - `n = 6`
  - `row1 = ">><<><"`
  - `row2 = "><>>><"`
  - The robot can follow the path: (1, 1) → (2, 1) → (2, 2) → (1, 2) → (1, 3) → (2, 3) → (2, 4) → (2, 5) → (2, 6).
  - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
- The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given problem description and constraints.
- The reasoning and checks in `func_1` are valid, and `func_2` processes the input and output correctly.
- The function `func_1` is designed to check for specific obstacles that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell, and it does so effectively.

Final: **True**
