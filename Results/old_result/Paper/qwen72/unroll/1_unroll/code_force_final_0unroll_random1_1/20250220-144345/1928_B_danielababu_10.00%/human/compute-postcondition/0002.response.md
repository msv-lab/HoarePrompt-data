The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element, and `i` starts at the index of the last element of `arr`.

For the loop to execute:
- `arr` must have at least one element.
- `i` must be set to the index of the last element of `arr`, which is `len(arr) - 1`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
