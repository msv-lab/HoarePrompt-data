n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, and the input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each character is either 'F', 'S', '?', or '.', and the i-th character of the j-th string is the same as the j-th character of the i-th string, with at most 2 * floor(n / 2) characters being 'F' or 'S'.
