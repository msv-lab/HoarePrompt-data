Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic used in the program to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Visibility Period**: The program calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`. This does not accurately represent the visibility period of the fireworks. The visibility period for a firework launched at time `x` is from `x` to `x + m`, inclusive. The program should consider the overlap of these periods for both installations.

2. **Incorrect Condition for Special Case**: The condition `if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1)` is not correct. The program should check if the installations can launch fireworks at the same time and then calculate the maximum overlap correctly.

3. **Incorrect Output for Special Cases**: The program does not handle the special case where both installations launch fireworks at the same frequency (i.e., `a == b`). In such cases, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time should be `1 + m // a + 1` if `a == 1` or `2 + m // a` otherwise.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if a == b:
            if a == 1:
                print(1 + m + 1)
            else:
                print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            lcm = (a * b) // gcd(a, b)
            max_fireworks = 2 + (m + lcm) // lcm - 1
            print(max_fireworks)

from math import gcd

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Handling Equal Frequencies**: If `a == b`, the installations launch fireworks at the same frequency. If `a == 1`, then the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `1 + m + 1` because each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes, and the installations launch fireworks every minute. If `a != 1`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2 + m // a` because the installations launch fireworks every `a` minutes, and the visibility period is `m + 1` minutes.

2. **Handling Different Frequencies**: If `a != b`, the program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the period at which both installations launch fireworks simultaneously. The maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is calculated as `2 + (m + lcm) // lcm - 1`, which accounts for the overlap of the visibility periods.

This corrected program should handle all cases correctly and produce the expected output.
