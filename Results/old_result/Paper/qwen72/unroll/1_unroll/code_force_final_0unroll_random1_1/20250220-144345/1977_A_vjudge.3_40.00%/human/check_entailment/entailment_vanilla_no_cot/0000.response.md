Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct for the given problem description. It correctly handles the logic for determining if it is possible to end up with a tower of exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. If `n == m`, Nikita can simply put one cube on top of the tower `m` times, so the answer is "Yes".
2. If `m > n`, it is impossible to have more cubes in the tower than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".
3. If `m == n - 1`, Nikita can put one cube on top `m` times and then remove one cube, so the answer is "Yes".
4. If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, it is possible to end up with an even number of cubes after an even number of moves, so the answer is "Yes".
5. If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, it is possible to end up with an odd number of cubes after an odd number of moves, so the answer is "Yes".
6. In all other cases, the answer is "No".

The program correctly implements these conditions and will produce the expected output for the given test cases.
