Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from the starting cell (1, 1) based on the arrows in the grid.
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (since `n` is even, it iterates up to `n // 2 - 1`).
   - For each cell in the first half, it checks if the robot is blocked from moving to the next position. Specifically, it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2 * i + 1` points left (`'<')` and if either the arrow in `row2` at position `2 * i` or `2 * i + 2` points left (`'<')`. If this condition is met, the robot is blocked, and the function returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks if the robot is blocked at the last column. If `row1[n - 1]` points left and `row2[n - 2]` points left, the robot is blocked, and the function returns 'No'.
   - If none of the blocking conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the strings `row1` and `row2`.
   - It calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line.

3. **Input and Output**:
   - The input constraints are respected: `t` is within the range [1, 10^4], `n` is an even integer within the range [2, 2 * 10^5], and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'.
   - The output format is correct: for each test case, the function prints 'Yes' or 'No' based on the result of `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is 2 correctly.
   - The function also handles larger values of `n` correctly by checking the conditions for each cell.

5. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm in `func_1` correctly identifies if the robot is blocked at any point by checking the arrows in the grid.
   - The algorithm ensures that the robot can move to the next position without being blocked, and it correctly checks the final position.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
