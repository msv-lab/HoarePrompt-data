The only objects in the loop head are the variables `tc` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `tc` is not defined, so it needs to be initialized to 0.

State: **`n` and `m` are such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 500, the total number of elements in all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5, `t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
