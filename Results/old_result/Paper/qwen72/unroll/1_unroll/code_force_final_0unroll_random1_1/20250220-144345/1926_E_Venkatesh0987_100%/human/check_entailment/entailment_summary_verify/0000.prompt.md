You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        i = 0
        d = n
        h = n
        p = 1
        g = 0
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it prints a value based on the following conditions: If \( k \) is greater than \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), it calculates and prints a value \( y \) which is \( 2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1) \), where \( i \) is the number of iterations needed to reach or exceed \( k \) by adding the largest possible odd number from \( n \), and \( f \) is the difference between \( k \) and the sum of the largest possible odd numbers up to \( i-1 \). If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), it directly prints \( 2 \times k - 1 \). The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where `k` is within the range of the odd numbers but the odd numbers are exhausted before reaching `k`. For example, consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 6`:

- The odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
- The cards laid down in the first step are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.
- The next step should lay down the cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6, 10.
- The next step should lay down the cards that are three times an odd number: 3, 9 (but 3 and 9 are already used).
- The next step should lay down the cards that are four times an odd number: 4, 8.
- The next step should lay down the cards that are five times an odd number: 5 (but 5 is already used).
- The next step should lay down the cards that are six times an odd number: 6 (but 6 is already used).
- The next step should lay down the cards that are seven times an odd number: 7 (but 7 is already used).
- The next step should lay down the cards that are eight times an odd number: 8.
- The next step should lay down the cards that are nine times an odd number: 9 (but 9 is already used).
- The next step should lay down the cards that are ten times an odd number: 10.

The correct order of cards laid down is: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 2, 6, 4, 8, 10.

However, the program will output `11` for `k = 6`, which is incorrect. The program fails to correctly handle the case where `k` is greater than the number of odd numbers but less than the total number of cards.
