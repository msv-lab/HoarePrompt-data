### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting the input strings to integers.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation**:
   - The program starts by calculating the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position, adding the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the cost `custo`.

3. **Final Cost Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates from the `max_p` position to the beginning of the queue.
   - It checks if the cost to move to the next position (`a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]`) is less than or equal to the cost of staying at the current position (`a_values[y]`).
   - If it is, it adds `b_values[y]` to the cost and continues.
   - If it is not, it adds `a_values[y]` to the cost and breaks the loop.
   - If the loop reaches the first position, it adds `a_values[0]` to the cost.

4. **Output**:
   - The program appends the calculated cost to the `custos` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in the `custos` list.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- The program aims to minimize the cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people.
- The initial cost calculation part is correct as it ensures Kirill moves to the `max_p` position by paying the minimum cost for each move.
- The final cost calculation part is also correct as it ensures Kirill moves to the optimal position within the first `m` people by comparing the costs of moving and staying.

However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the cost of moving from the `max_p` position to the beginning of the queue. It should consider the cumulative cost of moving through each position, not just the immediate next position.
   - The condition `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]` is not sufficient to ensure the minimum cost. It should consider the cumulative cost of moving through all positions from `y` to `1`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where `m` is 1 or `n` is 1 correctly. For example, if `m` is 1, Kirill should always move to the first position, and the cost should be `a_values[0]`.

### Correctness:
Given the issues with the cost calculation and edge cases, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
