Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to be called with no arguments, but the problem description implies that it should handle multiple test cases, each with inputs `n`, `x`, and `y` where `n` is the number of sides of a regular polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)), and `y` is the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x). Additionally, `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` are provided, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function should process these inputs to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.**
