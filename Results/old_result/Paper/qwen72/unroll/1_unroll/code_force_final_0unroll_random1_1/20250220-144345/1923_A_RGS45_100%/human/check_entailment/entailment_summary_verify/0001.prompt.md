You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads input from the user to process a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each character is either '0' or '1'). The function finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string and prints the number of '0's between these two occurrences. If a test case does not contain a '1', the function will print 0. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated and used during the execution of the function.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the array of cells `arr`.

2. **Array Conversion**:
   - The program converts the input array into a string `arr` by joining the elements and removing spaces. This is a valid step as it simplifies the subsequent operations.

3. **Finding the First and Last Chip**:
   - The program finds the index of the first chip (`x`) using `arr.find('1')`.
   - The program finds the index of the last chip from the right (`y`) using `arr[::-1].find('1')`. This is equivalent to finding the index of the last chip from the left.

4. **Extracting the Subarray**:
   - The program extracts the subarray `z` that contains all the chips and the free cells between them using `arr[x:n - y]`. This is correct because `x` is the index of the first chip and `n - y` is the index of the last chip (since `y` is the index from the right).

5. **Counting Free Cells**:
   - The program counts the number of free cells (`0`s) in the subarray `z` using `z.count('0')`. This is the correct approach because the number of free cells between the first and last chip is the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block without any free cells between them. The steps are logically sound and the operations are performed correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**
