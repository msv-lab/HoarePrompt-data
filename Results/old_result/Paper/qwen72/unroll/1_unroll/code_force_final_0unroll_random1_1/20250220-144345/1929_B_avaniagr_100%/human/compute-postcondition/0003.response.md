Functionality: ** The function reads multiple lines of input from the standard input, where each line contains two integers `n` and `k`. For each line, it calculates and prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an `n` x `n` grid to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the variables `n` and `k` will hold the values from the last input line processed. Other variables remain unchanged. **
