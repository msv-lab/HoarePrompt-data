The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0, indicating that there is at least one test case. Before the loop starts, `i` is not initialized, but it will be set to 0 by the `range(t)` function. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
