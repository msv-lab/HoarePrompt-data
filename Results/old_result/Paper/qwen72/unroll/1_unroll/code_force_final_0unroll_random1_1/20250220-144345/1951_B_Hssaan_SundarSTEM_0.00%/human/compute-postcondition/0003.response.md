Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. It then performs a series of swaps and checks to determine the maximum number of elements that can be placed in a non-decreasing order starting from the first element by either keeping the initial swap or swapping back the first and k-th elements. The result for each test case is printed. The function does not return any value, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `s` remain unchanged after each test case. **
