Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

    6
    
    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

# Functions with Execution Summary:

    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2

    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` takes an even integer `n` within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It checks if a robot can move from position (1,1) to position (2,n) based on the given rows. The function returns 'No' if at any point during the check, the robot is blocked from moving to the next position by '<' characters in `row1` and `row2`. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The function does not modify the input parameters `n`, `row1`, or `row2`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []

        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input. For each test case, it reads an even integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'. It processes each test case by calling `func_1` with `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and collects the results in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints the results, one per line. The function does not return any value.
