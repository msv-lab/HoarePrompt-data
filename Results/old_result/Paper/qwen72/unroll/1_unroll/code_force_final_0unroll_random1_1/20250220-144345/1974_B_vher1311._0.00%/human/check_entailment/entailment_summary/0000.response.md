Reasoning:  
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding algorithm as described in the problem. The function `func_1` is supposed to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process. However, the function does not do this. Instead, it:

1. Creates a sorted list of unique characters from the input string `s`.
2. Replaces each character in `s` with the last unique character from this sorted list.
3. Inserts characters that are not in the unique list (which should not happen because the input string `b` is guaranteed to only contain characters from the original string `s`).

This approach is flawed because it does not maintain the symmetric replacement required for decoding. Specifically, the function should map each character in the encoded string `b` back to its corresponding character in the original string `s` using the same symmetric rule (i.e., the first character in `r` should be replaced by the last, the second by the second-to-last, and so on).

The correct approach would involve:
1. Constructing the sorted list of unique characters `r` from the encoded string `b`.
2. Creating a mapping from each character in `b` to its symmetric character in `r`.
3. Using this mapping to decode the string `b` back to `s`.

Given the current implementation, the program does not produce the correct output for the given examples. For instance, it should return "codeforces" for the input "serofedsoc", but it does not.

Correctness: **False**
