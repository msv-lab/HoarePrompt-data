### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from the input and performs initial checks.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if `k` is odd or if `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` if `n` is odd, and `n^2 // 2` if `n` is even.
   - If `k` is even and within the valid range, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` such that its Manhattan value is `k`.
   - It starts with a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates through the list, modifying `l` and `k` to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` becomes 0, it returns the current state of `l`.
   - If `k` is less than the current value of `i - 1` during the loop, it calls `func_2` to perform a specific swap.
   - Otherwise, it continues to modify `l` and `k` until the loop completes, at which point it returns the final state of `l`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function performs a swap in the list `l` to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `len(l) - c - 1` and `len(l) - c - k - 1`.
   - The function ensures that the permutation remains valid and the Manhattan value is adjusted correctly.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function performs a swap in the list `l` to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c`.
   - The function ensures that the permutation remains valid and the Manhattan value is adjusted correctly.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function prints the result if a valid permutation is found.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the integers in the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - The function does not modify the list `l`.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function orchestrates the entire process.
   - It calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then `func_5` to print the result.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Input Validation**: `func_4` correctly checks if `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. This ensures that the program only proceeds with valid inputs.
- **Permutation Generation**: `func_1` generates a permutation by iteratively modifying the list `l` and reducing `k` until it reaches 0. The function uses `func_2` and `func_3` to perform specific swaps that adjust the Manhattan value.
- **Output**: `func_5` correctly prints the result in the required format.
- **Overall Flow**: `func_6` correctly handles the flow of the program, ensuring that the permutation is generated and printed if valid, or "NO" is printed if no valid permutation exists.

Given the problem constraints and the behavior of the functions, the program appears to correctly solve the problem for all valid inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
