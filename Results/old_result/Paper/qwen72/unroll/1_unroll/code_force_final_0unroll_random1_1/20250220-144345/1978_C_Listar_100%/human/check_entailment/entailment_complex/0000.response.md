### Reasoning:

1. **Input and Output Handling:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
   - For each test case, it determines if a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k` exists and prints the result accordingly.

2. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function checks if `k` is even and if `k` is within the possible range for the given `n`.
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n` is calculated as `(n^2 - 1) // 2` for odd `n` and `n^2 // 2` for even `n`.
   - If `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, the function returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns the input values `n` and `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`, where `k` is even.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates from `n` to 0 in steps of -2, decrementing `k` by `i - 1` and swapping elements in the list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - If `k` becomes 0, it returns the current permutation.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1` during the loop, it calls `func_2` to make the final adjustments to the permutation.
   - The function ensures that the final permutation has the correct Manhattan value.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function is called when `k` is less than `i - 1` in `func_1`.
   - It swaps the elements at specific indices to achieve the remaining Manhattan value.
   - The function ensures that the final permutation is valid and has the correct Manhattan value.

5. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function swaps elements at specific indices in the list `l` to modify the permutation.
   - It is used within `func_1` to adjust the permutation during the loop.

6. **Function `func_5`:**
   - This function prints the result for a valid permutation.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the permutation list `l`.

7. **Function `func_6`:**
   - This function handles each test case.
   - It calls `func_4` to validate `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and `func_5` to print it.

### Correctness Analysis:
- **Input Validation:**
  - `func_4` correctly checks if `k` is even and within the possible range for the given `n`.
  - It returns `(0, 0)` for invalid cases, which is correctly handled by `func_6` to print "NO".

- **Permutation Generation:**
  - `func_1` generates a permutation by iteratively swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
  - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the permutation is valid and the Manhattan value is correctly adjusted.
  - `func_2` and `func_3` are used to make specific swaps to achieve the final Manhattan value.

- **Output:**
  - `func_5` correctly prints the result for a valid permutation.
  - `func_6` ensures that the output is "NO" for invalid cases and "YES" followed by the permutation for valid cases.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the problem description and constraints. It generates valid permutations with the desired Manhattan value and prints the results as required.

**Correctness: True**
