Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers representing counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in a sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` which is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in `a` by 2. The function prints the value of `cnt` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The input variables and the loop control variable `_` are no longer relevant after the function concludes. **
