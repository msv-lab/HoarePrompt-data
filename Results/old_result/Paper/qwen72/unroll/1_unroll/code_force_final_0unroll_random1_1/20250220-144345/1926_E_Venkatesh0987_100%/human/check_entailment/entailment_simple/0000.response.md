Reasoning:

1. **Initial Check for k**: The program starts by checking if \( k \) is greater than \((n + 1) // 2\). This is a valid check because the first \((n + 1) // 2\) cards laid down are the odd-numbered cards, which are the smallest and most straightforward to determine.

2. **Odd-Numbered Cards**: If \( k \leq (n + 1) // 2 \), the program directly prints \( 2 \times k - 1 \). This is correct because the first \((n + 1) // 2\) cards are the odd numbers in ascending order. For example, if \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 2 \), the second odd number is 3, which is \( 2 \times 2 - 1 \).

3. **Handling Larger k**: If \( k > (n + 1) // 2 \), the program enters a more complex logic to determine the \( k \)-th card. The program uses a loop to find the number of iterations \( i \) needed to reach or exceed \( k \) by adding the largest possible odd number from \( n \). This is done by repeatedly subtracting \((d + 1) // 2\) from \( d \) and incrementing \( s \) by \((d + 1) // 2\).

4. **Calculating the Remaining k**: After determining \( i \), the program calculates \( g \), which is the sum of the largest possible odd numbers up to \( i-1 \). This helps in finding the remaining \( k \) value, \( f \), which is \( k - g \).

5. **Final Calculation**: The program then calculates \( y \) as \( 2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1) \) and prints it. This is the correct formula to find the \( k \)-th card in the sequence after the first \((n + 1) // 2\) odd-numbered cards.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when \( n = 1 \) and \( k = 1 \), and when \( k \) is the maximum possible value \( n \).

7. **Efficiency**: The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \). The loops and calculations are designed to terminate quickly, ensuring that the program can run within a reasonable time for large inputs.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the test cases provided.

Correctness: **True**
