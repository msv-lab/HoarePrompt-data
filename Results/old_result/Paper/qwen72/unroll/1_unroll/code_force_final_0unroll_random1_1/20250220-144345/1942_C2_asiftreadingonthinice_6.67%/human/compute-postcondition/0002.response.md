Output State: **The loop iterates `tt` times, and for each iteration, it reads input values for `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` chosen vertices. It then calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by choosing additional vertices, ensuring that no two chosen vertices are adjacent. The final result for each test case is printed as the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`. After all iterations, the variables `tt` and `ii` will have been decremented to 0, and the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `ans` will be overwritten in each iteration. The list `tmp` will be reset to an empty list at the start of each iteration.**
