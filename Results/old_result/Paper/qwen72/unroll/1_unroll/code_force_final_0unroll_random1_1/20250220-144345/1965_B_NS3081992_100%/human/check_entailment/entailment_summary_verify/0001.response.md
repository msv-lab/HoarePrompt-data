### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Sequence Generation in `func_14()`**:
   - **Special Case for `k == 1`**:
     - If `k == 1` and `n == 2`, the sequence `[2]` is returned. This is correct because it does not have a subsequence that sums to 1, and it covers the only required value, which is 2.
     - For `k == 1` and `n > 2`, the sequence `[2, 3, 2^2, 2^3, ..., 2^(l-1)]` is generated. This sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 because all elements are greater than 1. Additionally, it can form all values from 1 to `n` except 1 by using combinations of the elements.

   - **General Case for `k != 1`**:
     - The sequence is constructed by including powers of 2 up to `2^(lk-2)`, ensuring that the sum of these elements is less than `k`.
     - The element `k - 1 - sum(ans)` is added to make the sum of the sequence just below `k`. This ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k`.
     - The elements `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` are added to ensure that all values from `k + 1` to `n` can be formed.
     - The remaining powers of 2 from `2^(lk-1)` to `2^(l-1)` are added to cover the higher values up to `n`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function returns the length of the sequence and the sequence itself as a string.
   - The main function `func_15()` writes the output for each test case, ensuring that the results are correctly formatted and output.

4. **Validation**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to `k`**:
     - For `k == 1`, the sequence contains no 1s, so no subsequence can sum to 1.
     - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed such that the sum of any subsequence is either less than `k` or greater than `k` due to the inclusion of `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`.
   - **Subsequences Cover All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**:
     - The sequence includes powers of 2, which can form any sum up to `2^(l-1)`.
     - The inclusion of `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` ensures that all values from `k + 1` to `n` can be formed.
   - **Sequence Length**:
     - The sequence length is at most 25, which is within the problem constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem requirements. The sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while covering all other values from 1 to `n`.
