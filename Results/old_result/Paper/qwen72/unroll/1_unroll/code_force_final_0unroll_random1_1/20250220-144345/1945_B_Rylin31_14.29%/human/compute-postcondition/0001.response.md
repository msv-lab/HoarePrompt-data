The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function before the loop starts.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, `i` is 0**
