The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1 because `range(n - 1)` will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n - 2`, and this sequence must contain at least one element for the loop to run at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order.
- `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to guarantee that `n` is greater than 1 and that `i` starts at 0.

State: **`cities` is a list of n integers in strictly ascending order where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 1**
