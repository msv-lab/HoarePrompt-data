Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for the bitwise XOR of the sequence and how removing specific numbers can affect the XOR result to ensure Bob wins as many times as possible.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
The correct output should be `2` because Eve can remove the numbers in such a way that Bob wins twice. However, the program will output `3`, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve calculating the XOR of the sequence and then determining the optimal number of elements to remove to ensure the XOR remains zero as many times as possible. The current program does not do this and thus is incorrect.
