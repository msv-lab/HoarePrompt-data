To determine what will be printed by the given `print` statement, let's break down the initial state and the context provided:

### Initial State:
- The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points` will be modified based on the commands read from the input.
- Specifically, the `print` statement will output the final scores of two players, which are stored in the `points` list at indices 0 and 1.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
```

### Analysis:
1. **`points` List**: The `points` list is expected to contain at least two elements, which represent the scores of two players.
2. **`points[0]`**: This is the score of the first player.
3. **`points[1]`**: This is the score of the second player.
4. **Formatting**: The `print` statement uses the `%d` format specifier to format the integer values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` into the string.

### Output:
The `print` statement will output the final scores of the two players. Since the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are not provided in the initial state, we can only describe them based on the context that they are the scores of the two players.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where [points[0]] is the score of the first player and [points[1]] is the score of the second player)**
