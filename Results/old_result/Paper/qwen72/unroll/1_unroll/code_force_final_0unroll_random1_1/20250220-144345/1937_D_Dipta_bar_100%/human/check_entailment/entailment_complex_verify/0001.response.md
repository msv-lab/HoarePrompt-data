### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - This part of the program is accurate and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case with the grid string `s` as an argument.
   - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative movements of pinballs starting from the left and right, respectively.
   - This is consistent with the problem's requirements to handle left and right movements separately.

3. **Left to Right Movement (`A` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '>', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `A` and the positions stored in `idx_A`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated as the sum of the previous cumulative movement plus the distance from the last '>' to the current cell, multiplied by the number of '>' encountered so far.
   - The position `i` of each '>' is stored in `idx_A`.
   - This part is correctly implemented and matches the problem's rules for pinball movement and inversion.

4. **Right to Left Movement (`B` list):**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
   - For each cell `i` that contains '<', it calculates the cumulative movement `x` based on the previous movements stored in `B` and the positions stored in `idx_B`.
   - The cumulative movement `x` is calculated similarly to the left to right movement, but in reverse.
   - The position `i` of each '<' is stored in `idx_B`.
   - This part is also correctly implemented and matches the problem's rules for pinball movement and inversion.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - The program processes each cell `i` of the grid to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - Depending on whether the current cell contains '>' or '<', it uses the precomputed values in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative movements based on the current position and the positions of the last '>' and '<' encountered.
   - The logic for calculating the time in the `elif` and `else` blocks is complex but appears to be correct. However, it could be simplified for better readability and maintainability.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the calculated time for each cell `i` in the grid.
   - The output is formatted correctly, with each time separated by a space.
   - This matches the problem's requirements for output format.

### Potential Issues and Improvements:
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program does not explicitly handle the edge case where the grid length `n` is 1. However, the logic should still work correctly for this case, as the pinball will leave the grid immediately.
- **Complexity:**
  - The logic for calculating the time in the `elif` and `else` blocks is complex and could be simplified for better readability and maintainability.
- **Performance:**
  - The program could be optimized to reduce the number of conditional checks and improve performance, especially for large inputs.

### Validation of Original Assessment:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the input handling, function initialization, and the core logic for calculating cumulative movements and adjusting them based on the current position.
- The original assessment also correctly notes that the program ensures the pinball always leaves the grid within a finite number of steps.
- The original assessment mentions potential issues with edge cases and complexity, which are valid points but do not necessarily indicate incorrectness.

### Final Evaluation:
- The program correctly implements the logic for the pinball movement and inversion as described in the problem.
- The edge cases and complexity issues, while valid, do not affect the correctness of the program in solving the problem.

Final: **True**
