Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements.
   - Each element in `results` is the result of calling `func_1` with the corresponding `n`, `row1`, and `row2` from each test case.
   - `n`, `row1`, and `row2` are not defined outside the loop and are reset for each iteration.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print('\n'.join(results))
   ```

3. **Explanation**:
   - The `print` statement is using the `join` method to concatenate all elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - Since `results` contains `t` elements, each element being the result of calling `func_1` with specific parameters for each test case, the `print` statement will output each of these results on a new line.

4. **Output**:
   - The output will be a string where each line contains the result of calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - The exact values of these results depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the specific values of `n`, `row1`, and `row2` for each test case.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the output will be:

Output: **[result of func_1 for test case 1]
[result of func_1 for test case 2]
...
[result of func_1 for test case t]**

Where each line represents the result of `func_1` for the corresponding test case.
