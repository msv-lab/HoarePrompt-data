### Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array. Let's break down the program and the functions to see if it meets the requirements.

1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` again.
   - It then reads the array `a` using `func_3()`, which returns a list of integers.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted and converted to a set to remove duplicates.
   - The maximum element in the array `m` is found using `max(arr)`.
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

3. **Finding the Maximum Frequency:**
   - The program iterates over each element in the sorted array `arr`.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it calculates the position `a` where `arr[i] + n` would fit in the sorted array using `bisect_left(arr, arr[i] + n)`.
   - The difference `d = a - i` represents the number of elements in the array that can be made equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation.
   - The program updates `ans` with the maximum value of `d`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of Functions:

- **`func_1()`**: Reads an integer from the input. This is used to read the number of test cases and the length of the array in each test case.
- **`func_3()`**: Reads a space-separated list of integers and returns it as a list. This is used to read the array `a` for each test case.
- **`bisect_left(arr, x)`**: Returns the index where `x` would fit in the sorted list `arr`. This is used to find the position of `arr[i] + n` in the sorted array.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the array for each test case.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The array is sorted and duplicates are removed, which is a valid step to simplify the problem.
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the position of `arr[i] + n` is efficient and correct for the purpose of counting the number of elements that can be made equal.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Frequency:**
   - The program correctly calculates the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - The logic of `d = a - i` is correct because it counts the number of elements in the array that can be made equal to `arr[i] + n` by adding a permutation.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct result for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. It reads the input, processes the array, and outputs the maximum number of elements that can be made equal after adding a permutation. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
