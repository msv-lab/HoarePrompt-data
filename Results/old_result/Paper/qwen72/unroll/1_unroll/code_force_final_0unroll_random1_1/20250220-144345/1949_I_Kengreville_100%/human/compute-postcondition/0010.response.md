Output State: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`.**

The variable `bipartite` is now set to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
