The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list represents a test case. Each test case contains an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list of `n` integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 1) representing the cells of the ribbon. Each test case must contain at least one chip (a_i = 1).

The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. For each test case:
- Case_1: If the ribbon contains at least one chip, the function returns a specific result based on the ribbon configuration.
- Case_2: If the ribbon does not contain any chips, the function returns an error message indicating that the test case is invalid.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the cells of a ribbon. Each test case must contain at least one chip (a_i = 1). The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case. If a test case is valid (contains at least one chip), the function returns a specific result based on the ribbon configuration. If a test case is invalid (contains no chips), the function returns an error message.**
