Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described. It precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers up to the maximum possible value (200,000) and stores these sums in a list `pd`. For each test case, it then retrieves the precomputed sum for the given `n` and prints it. This approach ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases efficiently, adhering to the time limit of 0.5 seconds per test case. The precomputation step is correct and the retrieval for each test case is also handled properly. I cannot find a case where the program would not work as expected.
