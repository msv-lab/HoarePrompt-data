The function `func` is intended to accept two parameters: `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, and `s`, a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1'. However, the function definition provided does not include these parameters. Given the constraints, the function should process each test case and return a result based on the binary string provided for each case.

Functionality: **The function is intended to accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases and a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'. For each test case, it should return a result based on the binary string `s`.**
