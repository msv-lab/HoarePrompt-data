Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The function correctly checks if the total points (sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`) is even. This is necessary because each game results in either 2 points (if there is a winner and a loser) or 2 points (if it's a draw), so the total points must be even.
   - If the total points are not even, the function appends `-1` to the results, which is correct.

2. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total number of matches as `total_matchs = total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total score, either through a win/loss or a draw.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The function checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is incorrect. The number of matches can be more than 3, and `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` in some valid scenarios. For example, in the case `(3, 4, 5)`, the total points are 12, and the total matches are 6, which is valid.
   - The correct check should be to ensure that the total points are consistent with the possible outcomes of the games. Specifically, the total points should be achievable by a combination of wins, losses, and draws.

4. **Draw Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the number of draws as `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the idea that the difference in points between the highest and the other two players should be accounted for by wins and losses, and the remaining points should be from draws.
   - However, the formula is not entirely correct. The correct approach should be to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the total points are consistent with the scores.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `(0, 0, 0)`, the output `0` is correct because no games were played.
   - For the input `(0, 1, 1)`, the output `1` is correct because one draw could have occurred.
   - For the input `(0, 2, 3)`, the output should be `1` (one draw and one win/loss), but the function outputs `-1` because of the incorrect feasibility check.
   - For the input `(3, 3, 3)`, the output should be `3` (three draws), but the function outputs `-1` because of the incorrect feasibility check.
   - For the input `(3, 4, 5)`, the output should be `6` (three wins/losses and three draws), but the function outputs `-1` because of the incorrect feasibility check.
   - For the input `(1, 1, 10)`, the output `2` is correct because two draws and several wins/losses could have occurred.
   - For the input `(0, 0, 6)`, the output should be `3` (three draws), but the function outputs `-1` because of the incorrect feasibility check.

Given the issues with the feasibility check and the draw calculation, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
