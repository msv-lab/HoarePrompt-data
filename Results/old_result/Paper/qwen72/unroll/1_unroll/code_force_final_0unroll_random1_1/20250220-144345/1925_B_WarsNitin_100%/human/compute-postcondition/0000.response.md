The only objects in the loop head are the variables `q` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer within the specified range, it does not directly affect the loop head. However, the input value for the loop must be considered to ensure the loop executes.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `x` is an integer such that 1 <= x <= 10^8, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= x, `q` is 0, and the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
