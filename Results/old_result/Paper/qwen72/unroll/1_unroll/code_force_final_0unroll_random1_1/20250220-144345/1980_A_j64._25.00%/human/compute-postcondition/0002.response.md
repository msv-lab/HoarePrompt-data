The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `test_cases` and `results` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `_` is 0**
