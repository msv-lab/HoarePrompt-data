Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the movement of the robot in the correct sequence and does not account for the robot's ability to move along the arrows after its initial move. Here is a counterexample:

Input:
```
1
4
><><
><><
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
```

Actual Output:
```
yes
```

In this case, the robot starts at (1, 1) and the grid is as follows:
```
1: ><><
2: ><><
```

The robot's movements would be:
1. From (1, 1) to (1, 2) (initial move right).
2. From (1, 2) to (1, 1) (move along the arrow pointing left).
3. From (1, 1) to (1, 2) (initial move right again).
4. From (1, 2) to (1, 1) (move along the arrow pointing left again).

The robot is stuck in a loop between (1, 1) and (1, 2) and cannot reach (2, 4). Therefore, the program incorrectly prints "yes" instead of "NO".
