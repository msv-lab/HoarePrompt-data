Output State: **`t` is an integer input by the user such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 for each test case, `N` is 200001, `pd` is a list of length 200001 with all elements initialized to 0.**

The code initializes a list `pd` of length 200001, where each element in the list is set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `N` remain unchanged.
