### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `l` of the string and the trace array `array`.

2. **Alphabet Array**:
   - The program initializes an array `alp` containing all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z'. This is used to map the trace values to corresponding letters.

3. **Reversing the Array**:
   - The program reverses the trace array `array` to `rev_array`. This is a key step because it allows the program to build the string from the end to the beginning, ensuring that the count of previous occurrences is correctly maintained.

4. **Building the Answer**:
   - The program iterates over the length `l` of the string.
   - For each index `j`, it appends the corresponding letter from `alp` to the answer list `ans`. The letter is determined by the count of the current trace value in the remaining part of the reversed array (`rev_array[j:]`).
   - The expression `rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1` is used to find the position in the alphabet array. This works because the count of the current trace value in the reversed array gives the number of times the character has appeared before, and subtracting 1 gives the correct index in the alphabet array.

5. **Output**:
   - The program joins the list `ans` into a string and prints it.

### Analysis of the Algorithm:

- **Correctness**:
  - The program correctly handles the trace array by reversing it and using the count of the current value to determine the corresponding letter.
  - The use of the alphabet array ensures that the letters are chosen from 'a' to 'z' in the correct order.
  - The program guarantees that the output string will match the given trace array.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the case where the trace array has a single element (e.g., `n = 1`).
  - The program also handles the case where the trace array is all zeros (e.g., `n = 8` with all zeros).

- **Efficiency**:
  - The program uses a straightforward approach to build the string, which is efficient enough for the given constraints (sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`).

### Conclusion:

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly reconstructs a string from the given trace array.

### Correctness:
**True**
