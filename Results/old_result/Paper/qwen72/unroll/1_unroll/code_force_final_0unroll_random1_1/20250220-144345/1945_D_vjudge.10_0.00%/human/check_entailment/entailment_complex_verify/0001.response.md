### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input by reading the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting them to integers.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - The program starts by calculating the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`.
   - This part of the logic is correct and ensures that Kirill moves to the `max_p` position with the minimum cost.

3. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Positions:**
   - After reaching the `max_p` position, the program continues to calculate the cost for Kirill to move further up the queue.
   - It iterates from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue in reverse order.
   - For each position `y`, it checks if the cost to move to the next position (`a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]`) is less than or equal to the cost to stay at the current position (`a_values[y]`).
   - If the condition is met, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost and, if `y` is 1, it also adds `a_values[0]` (the cost to move to the first position).
   - If the condition is not met, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost and breaks the loop.
   - This part of the logic is intended to ensure that Kirill moves to the optimal position with the minimum cost, but it has a critical flaw.

4. **Flaw in the Second Loop:**
   - The second loop does not correctly handle the case where `max_p` is 1. If `max_p` is 1, Kirill should only consider the cost to move to the first position, which is `a_values[0]`.
   - The logic in the second loop might not always find the optimal solution, especially if the costs are not uniformly distributed. For example, if `max_p` is 2 and the costs are such that moving to position 1 is cheaper than staying at position 2, the program might not correctly identify this.

5. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total cost `custo` to the `custos` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in the `custos` list.
   - The output is correct if the cost calculation is correct.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: `max_p` is 1**
  - When `max_p` is 1, Kirill should only consider the cost to move to the first position, which is `a_values[0]`.
  - The program does not handle this case correctly. It enters the second loop and might add unnecessary costs.

- **Case 2: `max_p` is greater than 1**
  - The program correctly calculates the cost to move from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position.
  - However, the second loop might not always find the optimal solution. For example, if `max_p` is 2 and the costs are such that moving to position 1 is cheaper than staying at position 2, the program might not correctly identify this.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 4`, `m = 2`
  - `a_values = [7, 3, 6, 9]`
  - `b_values = [4, 3, 8, 5]`
  - The program calculates the cost to move from position 4 to 2 as `min(9, 5) + min(6, 8) = 5 + 6 = 11`.
  - Then it checks if moving to position 1 is cheaper: `a_values[0] + b_values[1] = 7 + 3 = 10` which is less than `a_values[1] = 3`.
  - It adds `b_values[1] = 3` to the cost, and since `y == 1`, it also adds `a_values[0] = 7`.
  - The total cost is `11 + 3 + 7 = 21`, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `14`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 6`, `m = 2`
  - `a_values = [6, 9, 7, 1, 8, 3]`
  - `b_values = [5, 8, 8, 1, 4, 1]`
  - The program calculates the cost to move from position 6 to 2 as `min(3, 1) + min(8, 4) + min(7, 8) = 1 + 4 + 7 = 12`.
  - Then it checks if moving to position 1 is cheaper: `a_values[0] + b_values[1] = 6 + 8 = 14` which is greater than `a_values[1] = 9`.
  - It adds `a_values[1] = 9` to the cost and breaks the loop.
  - The total cost is `12 + 9 = 21`, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `22`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 7`, `m = 7`
  - `a_values = [7, 2, 9, 2, 6, 5, 9]`
  - `b_values = [9, 1, 10, 7, 1, 4, 9]`
  - The program calculates the cost to move from position 7 to 7 as `0` (no movement needed).
  - The total cost is `0`, which is correct.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - `n = 2`, `m = 1`
  - `a_values = [2, 3]`
  - `b_values = [1, 1]`
  - The program calculates the cost to move from position 2 to 1 as `a_values[0] = 2`.
  - The total cost is `2`, which is incorrect. The correct cost should be `3`.

### Conclusion:
- The program has issues with handling the case where `max_p` is 1 and might not always find the optimal solution for the second loop.
- These issues can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in handling the case where `max_p` is 1 and the potential suboptimal cost calculation in the second loop.
