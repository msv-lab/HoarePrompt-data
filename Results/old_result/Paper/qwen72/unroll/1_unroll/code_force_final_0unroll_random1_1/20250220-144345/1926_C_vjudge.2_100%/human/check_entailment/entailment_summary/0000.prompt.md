Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Program:
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(pd[n])





# Execution Summary:
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from user input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another integer `n` from user input. The function precomputes a list `pd` of length 200001, where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < 200001) is the sum of all the digits of the integers from 1 to i, inclusive, plus the cumulative sum of the previous elements in the list. After precomputation, the function prints the value of `pd[n]` for each test case. The list `pd` remains unchanged after the function concludes.
