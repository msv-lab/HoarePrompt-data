### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that have specific indices as prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution must handle multiple test cases and output the count modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Program Structure and Functions**:
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = \gcd(a, b) \). This is essential for computing the modular inverse.
   - **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function correctly computes the modular inverse of \( b \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and then multiplies it by \( a \), returning the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program precomputes factorials up to \( 200002 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and stores them in the `facts` list.
   - For each test case, it reads the values \( n \), \( m_1 \), and \( m_2 \), and the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices.
   - It checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \( n \). If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, which is correct because such a permutation cannot exist.
   - If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of suitable permutations using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic.

4. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - The program uses the combinatorial formula to count the number of ways to arrange the elements between the given indices.
   - It uses the precomputed factorials and the modular inverse function to compute the binomial coefficients and other necessary values.
   - The combinatorial logic is applied to both the suffix and prefix maximums, ensuring that the elements between the maximums are arranged correctly.

5. **Validation of Annotations**:
   - The annotations for `func_1` and `func_2` are accurate and describe the state and behavior of the functions correctly.
   - The main logic of the program is correctly annotated, and the steps taken to compute the number of suitable permutations are logically sound.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program does not solve the given problem. The program does indeed solve the problem by correctly using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic to count the number of suitable permutations. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used appropriately to handle the modular inverse calculations, which are crucial for the combinatorial formulas.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Final: **True**
