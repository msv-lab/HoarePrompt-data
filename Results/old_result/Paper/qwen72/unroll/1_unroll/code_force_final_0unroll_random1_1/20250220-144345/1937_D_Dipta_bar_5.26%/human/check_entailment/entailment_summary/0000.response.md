Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of simulating the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid based on the characters '<' and '>'. The goal is to determine the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

### Key Points to Evaluate:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid length `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It then calls `func_1(s)` to process the string and print the results.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - It uses two lists, `A` and `B`, to store intermediate results:
     - `A` stores the cumulative time for pinballs starting from cells with '>' and moving to the right.
     - `B` stores the cumulative time for pinballs starting from cells with '<' and moving to the left.
   - The function iterates through the string `s` twice:
     - First, from left to right to populate `A`.
     - Second, from right to left to populate `B`.
   - After populating `A` and `B`, the function iterates through the string again to compute the final results for each cell and prints them.

3. **Calculation Logic:**
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If `s[i]` is '>', the function calculates the time based on the cumulative times in `A` and the positions in `idx_A`.
     - If `s[i]` is '<', the function calculates the time based on the cumulative times in `B` and the positions in `idx_B`.
   - The calculations involve adjusting the cumulative times based on the current position and the number of '<' and '>' characters encountered.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case in the specified format.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of `A` and `B` Population:**
  - The lists `A` and `B` are correctly populated to store the cumulative times for pinballs starting from cells with '>' and '<' respectively.
  - The logic for updating these lists is consistent with the problem description.

- **Final Calculation:**
  - The final calculation for each cell `i` is complex but follows the rules of the problem:
    - It correctly accounts for the inversion of the characters and the movement of the pinball.
    - The logic handles different scenarios based on the positions of '<' and '>' characters and the cumulative times stored in `A` and `B`.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases where the grid consists entirely of '<' or '>', or where there are no '<' or '>' characters in certain segments of the grid.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to correctly implement the logic for simulating the pinball movement and calculating the time it takes to leave the grid from each starting cell. The execution summary confirms that the function processes the string and prints the results as expected.

Correctness: **True**
