You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Note

The solution for the first test case can look as follows:

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `a` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y` from the input, where `0 <= x, y <= 99`. It then calculates a value `z` based on the formula `(y + 1) // 2` and adjusts `z` if a condition involving `m` (calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`) is met. The function prints the value of `z` for each test case. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (x) is less than the remaining space (m) after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the condition `if m < a:` is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons. The correct condition should be `if m < x:`.

Additionally, the calculation `15 * z - y * 4` is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. The correct calculation should account for the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons and then determine the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        if remaining_cells < x:
            additional_screens = (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        else:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        print(total_screens)
```

This version correctly calculates the number of screens needed for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
