The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `cases`. `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^7.

The function returns a list `results` containing `t` elements. Each element in the list `results` is a tuple `(25, sequence)`, where `sequence` is a list of the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of tuples `cases`. It returns a list `results` containing `t` elements, where each element is a tuple `(25, sequence)`. The `sequence` list contains the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24.**
