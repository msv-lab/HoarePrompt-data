Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is in the logic used to determine if a rectangle can be cut and reformed into another rectangle. The conditions provided are not logically sound and do not cover all necessary cases. For example, for the input `2 1`, the program should output "No" because a 2x1 rectangle cannot be cut and reformed into a different rectangle. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Yes" due to the condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`, which is always true for any integers `a` and `b` and does not correctly check the problem's requirements.

A correct implementation would check if either dimension of the rectangle is greater than 1, as this is the only condition under which Bob can form a different rectangle by cutting and reassembling. For example, the correct logic should be:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a > 1 and b > 1:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```
