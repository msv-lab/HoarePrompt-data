### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `A`, `B`, and `C` using `map(int, input().split())`.

2. **Price Comparison**:
   - The program first checks if the regular price for two yogurts (`B * 2`) is less than the promotional price (`C`). If this is true, it means it is cheaper to buy each yogurt individually rather than using the promotion.
   - In this case, the program prints the total cost as `A * B`, which is correct because Maxim will buy all `A` yogurts at the regular price.

3. **Even Number of Yogurts**:
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is even, the program calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`. This is correct because Maxim can buy all yogurts in pairs at the promotional price, and the division by 2 ensures the correct number of pairs.

4. **Odd Number of Yogurts**:
   - If the number of yogurts `A` is odd, the program calculates the number of pairs `X` as `A // 2` and the cost for these pairs as `X * C`.
   - It then adds the cost of one additional yogurt at the regular price `B` to the total cost.
   - This is correct because Maxim can buy `A - 1` yogurts in pairs and the remaining one yogurt at the regular price.

### Correctness:
The program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem. It ensures that Maxim buys the yogurts at the minimum cost by comparing the regular price and the promotional price and making the appropriate calculations based on the number of yogurts.

**Correctness: True**
