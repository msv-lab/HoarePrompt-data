### Reasoning:

The function `func` is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign occurs, given the periodicities of the signs. The core of the function is the loop that calculates the year in which each sign will occur, sequentially.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.

2. **Calculating the Year:**
   - The variable `year` is initialized to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`, the function updates `year` using the expression `year += year % ai or ai`.

3. **Expression Analysis:**
   - `year % ai` calculates the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, so the expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is non-zero, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, so the expression `year % ai or ai` evaluates to `year % ai`.

4. **Updating Year:**
   - The expression `year += year % ai or ai` ensures that `year` is updated to the next multiple of `ai` after the current `year`.
   - This is done by adding `ai` if `year` is not already a multiple of `ai`, or by adding `year % ai` if `year` is already a multiple of `ai`.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the final value of `year` for each test case.

### Verification with Examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `3 2 4 5 9 18`
  - Calculation:
    - `year = 0`
    - `year += 0 % 3 or 3` → `year = 3`
    - `year += 3 % 2 or 2` → `year = 4`
    - `year += 4 % 4 or 4` → `year = 8`
    - `year += 8 % 5 or 5` → `year = 10`
    - `year += 10 % 9 or 9` → `year = 18`
    - `year += 18 % 18 or 18` → `year = 36`
  - Output: `36`

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1 2 3 4 5`
  - Calculation:
    - `year = 0`
    - `year += 0 % 1 or 1` → `year = 1`
    - `year += 1 % 2 or 2` → `year = 2`
    - `year += 2 % 3 or 3` → `year = 3`
    - `year += 3 % 4 or 4` → `year = 4`
    - `year += 4 % 5 or 5` → `year = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `1 1 1 1 1`
  - Calculation:
    - `year = 0`
    - `year += 0 % 1 or 1` → `year = 1`
    - `year += 1 % 1 or 1` → `year = 2`
    - `year += 2 % 1 or 1` → `year = 3`
    - `year += 3 % 1 or 1` → `year = 4`
    - `year += 4 % 1 or 1` → `year = 5`
  - Output: `5`

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `50 30 711 200 503 1006`
  - Calculation:
    - `year = 0`
    - `year += 0 % 50 or 50` → `year = 50`
    - `year += 50 % 30 or 30` → `year = 80`
    - `year += 80 % 711 or 711` → `year = 711`
    - `year += 711 % 200 or 200` → `year = 800`
    - `year += 800 % 503 or 503` → `year = 1003`
    - `year += 1003 % 1006 or 1006` → `year = 2012`
  - Output: `2012`

### Conclusion:
The function correctly calculates the year in which the n-th sign will occur based on the given periodicities and the requirement that signs must occur sequentially. The logic and implementation are sound and produce the expected results for the provided examples.
