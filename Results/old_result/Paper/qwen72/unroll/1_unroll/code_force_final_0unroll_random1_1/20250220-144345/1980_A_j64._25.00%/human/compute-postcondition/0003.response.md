Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n <= 50, 1 <= m <= 5) and a string `a` consisting of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G', `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that are missing from the corresponding string `a` in `test_cases` to reach the frequency `m` for each character.
