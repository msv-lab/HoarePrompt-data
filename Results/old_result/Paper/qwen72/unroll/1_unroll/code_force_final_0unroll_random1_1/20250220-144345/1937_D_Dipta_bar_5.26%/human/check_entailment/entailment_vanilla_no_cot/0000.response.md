Correctness: **False**

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the main problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Steps**: The way the program calculates the number of steps for the pinball to leave the grid is overly complex and incorrect. The logic for calculating `a` and `b` and their contributions to the final step count is flawed.

2. **Mismanagement of Indices**: The program uses indices `l` and `r` to manage the positions of '>' and '<' characters, but the way these indices are updated and used in the calculations is not consistent and can lead to incorrect results.

3. **Complexity and Readability**: The program is unnecessarily complex, making it hard to understand and verify. A simpler approach can be used to solve the problem.

### Correct Approach

A simpler and more correct approach involves precomputing the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell. This can be done using two passes through the string:

1. **Left to Right Pass**: Calculate the number of steps for the pinball to leave the grid if it starts moving to the right.
2. **Right to Left Pass**: Calculate the number of steps for the pinball to leave the grid if it starts moving to the left.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    
    # Precompute steps to leave the grid moving right
    steps_right = [0] * n
    last_right = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '>':
            last_right = i
        steps_right[i] = i - last_right if last_right != -1 else float('inf')
    
    # Precompute steps to leave the grid moving left
    steps_left = [0] * n
    last_left = -1
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '<':
            last_left = i
        steps_left[i] = last_left - i if last_left != -1 else float('inf')
    
    # Answer each query
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '>':
            # Moving right initially
            print(steps_right[i] + (steps_right[i] - 1) // 2, end=' ')
        else:
            # Moving left initially
            print(steps_left[i] + (steps_left[i] - 1) // 2, end=' ')
    print()
```

### Explanation

1. **Precompute Steps to Leave Moving Right**:
   - `steps_right[i]` is the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid if it starts moving to the right from cell `i`.
   - `last_right` keeps track of the last '>' character seen from the left.

2. **Precompute Steps to Leave Moving Left**:
   - `steps_left[i]` is the number of steps required for the pinball to leave the grid if it starts moving to the left from cell `i`.
   - `last_left` keeps track of the last '<' character seen from the right.

3. **Answer Each Query**:
   - For each cell `i`, if the character is '>', the pinball will move right initially. The total steps are `steps_right[i]` plus the number of times the pinball will bounce back and forth.
   - If the character is '<', the pinball will move left initially. The total steps are `steps_left[i]` plus the number of times the pinball will bounce back and forth.

This approach ensures that the pinball's movement is correctly calculated and the program is much simpler and easier to understand.
