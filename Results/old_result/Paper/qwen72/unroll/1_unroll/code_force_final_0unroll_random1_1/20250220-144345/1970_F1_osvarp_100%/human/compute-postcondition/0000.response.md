Output State: **`el` is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is a digit from '0' to '9'; `res` is True.**

Explanation: The value of `res` is determined by the expression `(el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'`. Given that the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R', the first part of the expression `(el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R')` is always True. The second part of the expression `el[1] != 'G'` is also always True because the second character is a digit from '0' to '9', which cannot be 'G'. Therefore, `res` is True. The initial state of `el` remains unchanged.
