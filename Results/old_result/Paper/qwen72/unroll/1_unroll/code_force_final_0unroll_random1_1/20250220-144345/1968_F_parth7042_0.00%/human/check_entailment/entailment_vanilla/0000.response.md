### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads all input data in one go using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - The index `idx` is used to traverse this list and extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program initializes a prefix XOR array `pf` and a dictionary `mp` to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - For each element in the array `a`, it updates the prefix XOR array `pf` and the dictionary `mp`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XOR array: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.
   - If `x` is 0, the subarray is interesting because it can be split into parts where each part's XOR is 0.
   - If `x` is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[r]` and `pf[j] == pf[l - 1]` and `l <= i <= r` and `l <= j <= r`. This is done using the `bisect` module to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.

4. **Output:**
   - The results for each query are stored in the `results` list and printed at the end.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Prefix XOR Array (`pf`):**
  - The prefix XOR array is correctly calculated. For each element `a[i]`, `pf[i]` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
  - This allows us to quickly compute the XOR of any subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

- **Dictionary (`mp`):**
  - The dictionary `mp` is used to store the indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
  - This helps in quickly finding if there are valid indices for splitting the subarray into parts with equal XOR values.

- **Query Handling:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where the XOR of the subarray is 0, which means the subarray is interesting.
  - For non-zero XOR values, the program uses binary search to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`. This ensures that the subarray can be split into parts with equal XOR values if such indices exist.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where the subarray is the entire array.
  - It also correctly handles the case where the subarray has only one element (though the problem guarantees `l < r`).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. It efficiently uses prefix XOR and binary search to handle the queries.
