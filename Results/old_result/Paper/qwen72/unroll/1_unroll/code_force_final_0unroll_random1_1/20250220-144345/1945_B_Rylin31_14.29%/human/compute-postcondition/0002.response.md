Output State: **t is an input integer between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 <= a, b, m <= 10^18. The loop has completed all iterations, and the final values of a, b, and m are the same as their initial values for each test case. The output for each test case is either (min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b + 1 or (min(a, b) + m) // a + (min(a, b) + m) // b, depending on the conditions specified in the loop.**
