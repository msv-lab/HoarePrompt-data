You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [0]
        c = [0]
        (i, j) = (0, 0)
        for x in l:
            if x == 1:
                j += 1
            i += x
            p.append(i)
            c.append(j)
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            i = c[b] - c[a - 1]
            s = p[b] - p[a - 1]
            if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of positive integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines and prints whether the specified subarray is "good" based on the condition that the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of ones in the subarray, provided the subarray length is greater than 1. If the condition is not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the results for each query have been printed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the case where the subarray contains all the same elements greater than 1. For example, consider the following input:

```
1
3 1
2 2 2
1 3
```

The subarray `c[1:3]` is `[2, 2, 2]`. According to the problem, this subarray should be considered good because we can construct an array `b` such that:

- The sum of elements in `b` is the same as the sum of elements in `c[1:3]` (i.e., 6).
- Each element in `b` is different from the corresponding element in `c[1:3]`.
- Each element in `b` is greater than 0.

One possible `b` could be `[1, 2, 3]`, which satisfies all the conditions. However, the program will output `NO` for this case because it incorrectly assumes that the subarray is not good if it contains the same elements.

The issue lies in the condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:`. This condition is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good, especially when all elements in the subarray are the same and greater than 1.
