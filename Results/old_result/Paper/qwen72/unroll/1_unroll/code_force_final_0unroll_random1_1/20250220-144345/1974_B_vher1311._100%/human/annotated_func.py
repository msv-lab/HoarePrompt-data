#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a new string where each character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`, based on the `mapping` dictionary.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `encoded`, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It returns a new string where each character in the original `encoded` string is replaced by its corresponding character in reverse order of the unique characters in `encoded`, based on a mapping dictionary. The unique characters in `encoded` are first sorted and then mapped to their reverse positions. The final state of the program is that the original `encoded` string is transformed into a new string according to this mapping.
