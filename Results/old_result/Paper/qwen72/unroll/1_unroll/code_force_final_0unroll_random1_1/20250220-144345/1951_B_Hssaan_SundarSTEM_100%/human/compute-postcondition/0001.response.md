Output State: **The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum number of elements in the list `s` that can be made non-decreasing by swapping the first element with the k-th element or by swapping the first element with the k-th element and then swapping the element at position `p` with the k-th element. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.**
