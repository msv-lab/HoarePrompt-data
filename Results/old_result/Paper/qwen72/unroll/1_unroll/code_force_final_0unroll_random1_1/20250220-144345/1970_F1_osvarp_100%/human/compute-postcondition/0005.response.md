Output State: **`n` and `m` are specific odd integers read from the input, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is a dictionary with the key `'.B'` mapped to the value `(-1, -1)`, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list containing two empty lists, `points` is [0, 0].** 

The initial state is updated such that the `points` list is now explicitly set to [0, 0], representing the scores of the red and blue teams. All other variables remain unchanged.
