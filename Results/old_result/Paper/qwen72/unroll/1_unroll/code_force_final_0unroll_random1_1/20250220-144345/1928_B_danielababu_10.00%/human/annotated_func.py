def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that the user inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value provided by the user. After the function concludes, the program has received an integer input from the user and the function has returned this integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function `func_2` does not take any input parameters. It reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the integers from the space-separated string of integers provided through standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input and returns a map object that contains these integers. The function does not take any input parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the map object can be iterated over to access the integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed to the function. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers converted from the space-separated list of integers provided as input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input and returns a list of integers. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a list of integers derived from the input provided.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from the standard input, which is expected to contain integers separated by spaces.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers read from the standard input, where the integers were originally provided as a space-separated string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input and returns a sorted list of these integers. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the program has a sorted list of integers that were originally provided as a space-separated string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are used in the function signature.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element from the input (split by spaces) into a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns an iterator that converts each element from the user input (split by spaces) into a string. After the function call, the program state includes an iterator that can be used to access the string representations of the input elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list containing each character of the input string as individual elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts no parameters and returns a list containing each character of the input string as individual elements. The input is taken from the user during the function's execution. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the returned list contains the characters of the input string in the order they were entered.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated string of integers.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string was originally an integer from the space-separated input provided.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input and returns a sorted list of strings, where each string was originally an integer from the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers.

        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers, `ans` is a list where each element is the product of all elements in `arr` up to that index, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements in `arr` up to that index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. Each element in `ans` is the product of all elements in `arr` up to that index. The input list `arr` remains unchanged.

        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` remains the same list of integers, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving to the first, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns `ans`, which is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving to the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans` containing the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element and moving to the first. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
