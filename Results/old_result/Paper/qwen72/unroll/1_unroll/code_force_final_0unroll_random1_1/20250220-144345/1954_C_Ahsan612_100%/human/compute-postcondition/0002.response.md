The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships described, it can be inferred that the function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. 

- `t` is an integer where 1 <= t <= 1000, representing the number of test cases.
- `x` and `y` are integers for each test case, such that 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and they consist only of digits from 1 to 9.

The function returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y` for each of the `t` test cases. However, the specific output or return value based on `x` and `y` is not provided in the example. 

Given the constraints and the lack of specific output details, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, `x`, and `y`. `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with 1 <= t <= 1000. `x` and `y` are integers for each test case, with 1 <= x, y < 10^100, and they consist only of digits from 1 to 9. The function processes these parameters for each test case and returns a result based on the values of `x` and `y`.**
