Let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step:

### Initial State:
- `idx` is defined as `2 * (t + q * t)`.
- `results` is a list containing `t * q + t` strings. Each string in the list is either 'YES' or 'NO', followed by an empty string for each test case.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Understanding `results`**:
   - `results` is a list of strings.
   - The length of `results` is `t * q + t`.
   - Each element in `results` is either 'YES' or 'NO', followed by an empty string.

2. **Understanding `idx`**:
   - `idx` is calculated as `2 * (t + q * t)`.
   - Simplifying this, `idx = 2 * t * (1 + q)`.

3. **Output of `print('\n'.join(results))`**:
   - The `join` method is used to concatenate all the elements in the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
   - Therefore, the `print` statement will print each string in `results` on a new line.

### Final Output:
Since the exact values of `t` and `q` are not provided, we can't determine the exact number of elements in `results` or their specific values. However, based on the given information, we know that `results` contains `t * q + t` strings, each of which is either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by an empty string.

Output: **[t * q + t lines of either 'YES' or 'NO' followed by an empty string]**
