No variables are passed to the function `func_2`. The function reads input values directly, where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` is an even integer within the range 2 to 2 * 10^5, and `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` containing only the characters '<' and '>'.
