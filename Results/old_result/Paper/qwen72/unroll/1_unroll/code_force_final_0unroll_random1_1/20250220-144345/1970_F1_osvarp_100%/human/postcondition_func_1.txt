The function `goalIn` accepts a position `pos` and checks if it is in the goal positions of the red team or the blue team. It returns 0 if `pos` is in the red team's goal positions, 1 if `pos` is in the blue team's goal positions, and -1 if `pos` is not in either team's goal positions. The function does not modify any input parameters or global state.
