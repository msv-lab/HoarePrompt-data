Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle the case where the number of 1x1 icons (x) is less than the remaining space (m) after placing the 2x2 icons. Specifically, the condition `if m < a:` is incorrect because `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of 1x1 icons. The correct condition should be `if m < x:`.

Additionally, the calculation `15 * z - y * 4` is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the remaining space on the screens after placing the 2x2 icons. The correct calculation should account for the total number of cells used by the 2x2 icons and then determine the remaining space for 1x1 icons.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        screens_for_2x2 = (y + 1) // 2
        remaining_cells = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - y * 4
        if remaining_cells < x:
            additional_screens = (x - remaining_cells + 14) // 15
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + additional_screens
        else:
            total_screens = screens_for_2x2
        print(total_screens)
```

This version correctly calculates the number of screens needed for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
