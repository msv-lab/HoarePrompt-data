Output State: **`leaves` is a list containing all the nodes in `tree` that have exactly one connection, `tree` is a defaultdict of lists where each key is an integer from 1 to n, and the value for each key is a list containing all the integers that are connected to the key by an edge in the `edges` list. The lists are not necessarily sorted. The variables `n`, `edges`, and `start` remain unchanged. `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` as computed by the `bfs` function. `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` as computed by the `bfs` function.**
