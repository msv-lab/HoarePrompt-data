Output State: **The loop will process each test case and print the smallest index (1-based) where the percentage of residents wanting to live on the left side and the percentage of residents wanting to live on the right side are both at least 50%. If no such index exists, it will print 0 if the overall percentage of residents wanting to live on the right side is at least 50%, otherwise it will print n (the total number of houses). This process will be repeated for each test case, and the final output will be a series of integers, one for each test case.**
