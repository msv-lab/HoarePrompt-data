The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, but since the state already specifies that `2 <= n <= 24`, the loop will definitely execute at least once. The variable `i` is initialized to 1 for the first iteration of the loop.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is 1 and `n` is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, `i` is 1**
