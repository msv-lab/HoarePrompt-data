The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the variable `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The state of `pd` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`pd` is a list of length 200001 where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < 200001) is the sum of all the digits of the integers from 1 to i, inclusive, and the cumulative sum of the previous elements in the list, `t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**
