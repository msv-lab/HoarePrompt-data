### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly defines the number of test cases (`t`) and the test cases themselves (`test_cases`).
   - It calls `func_1` with `t` and `test_cases` as arguments and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and `a`).
   - For each test case, it initializes a frequency list `freq` with 7 elements (one for each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G') set to 0.
   - It iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` based on the difficulty level of each problem. This is done using the `ord` function to convert the character to its ASCII value and subtracting the ASCII value of 'A' to get the index (0 for 'A', 1 for 'B', etc.).
   - After calculating the frequency of each difficulty level, it calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level. This is done by taking the maximum of 0 and `m - f` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. If `f` is less than `m`, it means there are not enough problems of that difficulty level, and `m - f` gives the number of additional problems needed.
   - The total number of missing problems is the sum of these values.
   - The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case.

### Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G' respectively)
  - Missing: `sum((max(0, 1 - f) for f in freq)) = 2` (one 'A' and one 'F' are missing)
  - Output: `2` (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G' respectively)
  - Missing: `sum((max(0, 2 - f) for f in freq)) = 5` (one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', one 'E', and one 'F' are missing)
  - Output: `5` (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G' respectively)
  - Missing: `sum((max(0, 1 - f) for f in freq)) = 1` (one 'A' is missing)
  - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description. The logic and implementation are sound.

Final: **True**
