You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: `custos` is a list containing the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe his way to a position no greater than `m` for each of the `t` test cases. The length of `custos` is equal to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `x` are not directly modified by the loop, but `a_values` and `b_values` are populated from input for each test case.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: The values of `custos` are printed one by one, and the state of `custos` remains unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `x` are also unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue `n`, the maximum allowable final position `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` representing the costs to bribe individuals. It calculates and prints the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed costs for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, and `b_values` are not directly modified by the function.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the input by reading the number of test cases `x`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.
   - It then reads the `a_values` and `b_values` lists, converting them to integers.

2. **Initial Cost Calculation:**
   - The program starts by calculating the cost for Kirill to move from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position.
   - It iterates from the end of the queue to the `max_p` position in reverse order.
   - For each position `y` in this range, it adds the minimum of `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` to the total cost `custo`.

3. **Cost Calculation for Remaining Positions:**
   - After reaching the `max_p` position, the program continues to calculate the cost for Kirill to move further up the queue.
   - It iterates from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue in reverse order.
   - For each position `y`, it checks if the cost to move to the next position (`a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y]`) is less than or equal to the cost to stay at the current position (`a_values[y]`).
   - If the condition is met, it adds `b_values[y]` to the total cost and, if `y` is 1, it also adds `a_values[0]` (the cost to move to the first position).
   - If the condition is not met, it adds `a_values[y]` to the total cost and breaks the loop.

4. **Output:**
   - The program appends the total cost `custo` to the `custos` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints each cost in the `custos` list.

### Analysis:
- The program's logic is designed to minimize the cost for Kirill to reach a position within the first `m` people.
- The initial cost calculation is correct for positions from `num_fila` to `max_p`.
- The subsequent cost calculation for positions from `max_p - 1` to the beginning of the queue is also correct, as it ensures that Kirill moves to the optimal position with the minimum cost.

### Potential Issues:
- The program does not handle the case where `max_p` is 1 correctly. If `max_p` is 1, Kirill should only consider the cost to move to the first position, which is `a_values[0]`.
- The logic for the second loop (from `max_p - 1` to the beginning) might not always find the optimal solution, especially if the costs are not uniformly distributed.

### Conclusion:
- The program's logic is mostly correct, but it has a potential issue with handling the case where `max_p` is 1.
- The second loop's logic might not always find the optimal solution, leading to incorrect results in some edge cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program has issues with handling the case where `max_p` is 1 and might not always find the optimal solution for the second loop. These issues can lead to incorrect results in some test cases.
