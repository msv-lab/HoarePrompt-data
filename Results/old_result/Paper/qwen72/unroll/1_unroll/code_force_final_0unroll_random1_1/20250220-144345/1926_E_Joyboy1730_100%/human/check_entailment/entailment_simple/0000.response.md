### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` from the input.

2. **Card Laying Process**:
   - The program aims to simulate the process of laying down cards as described in the problem statement.
   - The list `L` is used to store the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - The while loop calculates the number of cards that can be laid down in each step by dividing `n` by 2 and rounding up, then subtracting this number from `n` and appending it to `L`.

3. **Finding the k-th Card**:
   - The variable `tot` keeps track of the cumulative number of cards laid down.
   - The variable `pow` is used to determine the multiplier for the current step (1, 2, 4, 8, etc.).
   - The for loop iterates through the list `L` to find the step in which the k-th card is laid down.
   - If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, it means the k-th card is in the current step, and the program prints the card number using the formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - The `tot` is updated by adding the number of cards laid down in the current step, and `pow` is doubled for the next step.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly by laying down the card 1.
   - The program also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly by laying down the last card in the sequence.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the upper bounds of `n` and `k` (up to \(10^9\)) within the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It follows the described process and handles all edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
