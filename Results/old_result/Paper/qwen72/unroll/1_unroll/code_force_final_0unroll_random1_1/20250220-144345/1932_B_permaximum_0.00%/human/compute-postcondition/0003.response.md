The function `func` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. The list `a` represents the periodicities of the signs and has a length of `n`. Each element `a_i` in the list `a` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function should also handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a` and an integer `n`. It returns the result of processing the periodicities of the signs based on the list `a` and the number of signs `n`. The function is designed to handle multiple test cases, ensuring that each test case is processed independently.**
