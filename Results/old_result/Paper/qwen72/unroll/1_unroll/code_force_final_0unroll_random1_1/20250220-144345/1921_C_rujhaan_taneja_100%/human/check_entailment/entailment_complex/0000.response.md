### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each message.

3. **Charge Consumption Calculation**:
   - The function iterates over the list `arr` to calculate the charge consumption for each message.
   - For the first message, it checks if the time `arr[0]` is less than `b / a`. If true, it appends `arr[0] * a` to `array2`.
   - For subsequent messages, it checks if the difference between consecutive message times `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is less than `b / a`. If true, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

4. **Final Condition Check**:
   - The function calculates the total charge consumption for the messages that are not turned off and on (`sum(array2)`) and adds the charge consumption for turning off and on the phone for the remaining messages (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).
   - It then checks if this total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`. If true, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Condition for First Message**:
  - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` should be `if arr[0] * a < f` to ensure that the initial charge is sufficient to send the first message without turning the phone off and on.
- **Incorrect Condition for Subsequent Messages**:
  - The condition `elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` should be `elif (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a < f - sum(array2) - (i - len(array2)) * b` to ensure that the remaining charge is sufficient to send the message without turning the phone off and on.
- **Incorrect Final Condition**:
  - The final condition `if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f` should be `if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b <= f` to account for the possibility that the charge can be exactly zero after sending all messages.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[3]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] * a < f:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            else:
                if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a < f - sum(array2) - (i - len(array2)) * b:
                    array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program correctly handles the conditions and logic as described in the problem.
- **False** if the program contains logical errors or incorrect conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine whether the phone can send messages without running out of charge. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly.
