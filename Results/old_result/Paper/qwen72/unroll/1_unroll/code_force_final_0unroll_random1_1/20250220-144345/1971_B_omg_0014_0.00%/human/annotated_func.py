#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the input parameters are not defined in the provided function signature. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, as indicated by the integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) in the input description, but this is not reflected in the current function definition.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        
        a = set(s)
        
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)
        
    #State: The loop iterates `n` times, and for each iteration, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest and largest versions of `s` (if `s` is already in lexicographical order, it prints the lexicographically largest version). The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are updated within the loop for each iteration, but their final values depend on the last string `s` processed. The variable `s` will hold the last input string read. The variable `n` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a string `s` from the input. If the string `s` contains exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', followed by the lexicographically smallest version of `s` (if `s` is not already in lexicographical order) or the lexicographically largest version of `s` (if `s` is already in lexicographical order). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value. The final state of the program includes the variables `n` (unchanged), `s` (holding the last input string read), and `a`, `b`, and `c` (updated based on the last string processed).
