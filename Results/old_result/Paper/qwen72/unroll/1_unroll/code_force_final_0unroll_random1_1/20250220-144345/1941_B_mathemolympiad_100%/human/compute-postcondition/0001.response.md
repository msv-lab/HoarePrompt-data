The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and `numTest`. For the loop to execute, `numTest` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted as it is not used in the loop head. The other variables `t`, `n`, and `a` are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0**
