To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects in the loop head, which are `l`, `r`, and `ops`. The loop will execute if `ops` is an iterable that contains at least one element, and for the first iteration, `l` and `r` will be the first element in `ops`.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of integers input by the user.
- `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `ops` is the third value returned by `func_2(a)`.

For the loop to execute:
- `ops` must be an iterable that contains at least one element.
- `l` and `r` will be the first element in `ops` during the first iteration.

State:
**`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers input by the user, `s` is the first value returned by `func_2(a)`, `m` is the second value returned by `func_2(a)`, `ops` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 element, `l` and `r` are the first tuple in `ops`**

This ensures that the loop can start and execute at least once.
