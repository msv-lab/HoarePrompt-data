The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, we can infer that the function likely accepts at least two parameters, `n` and `k`, and possibly an additional parameter `t` to represent the number of test cases. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.

The function is expected to return a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `k`, where `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
