Postcondition: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to `True`, `coef` is a list of integers of length `n` with some elements possibly changed to `1`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, and `ok` is `True` because at least one `dfs(i)` call resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not being `0`.**
