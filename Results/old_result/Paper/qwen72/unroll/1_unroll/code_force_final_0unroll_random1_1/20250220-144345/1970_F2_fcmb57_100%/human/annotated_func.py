#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions of the field (3 <= a, b <= 99, a and b are odd).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns an error because `dx` and `dy` are not assigned, and `x` and `y` are not assigned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` is intended to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be integers. However, the function attempts to unpack `a` into `x` and `y`, and `b` into `dx` and `dy`, which results in an error because `a` and `b` are single integers and not iterable. The function does not return any valid values and will always raise a `ValueError` due to the incorrect unpacking.
