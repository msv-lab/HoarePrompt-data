The provided Python code snippet is an empty `print()` statement. Given the initial state, the loop prints each integer in the `mex` list separated by a space, and the values of `mex`, `minn`, and `used` remain unchanged.

Since the `print()` statement in the code snippet is empty, it will not print any values or text. It will simply print a newline character, which moves the cursor to the next line in the output.

Output: **(an empty line)**
