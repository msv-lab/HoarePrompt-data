Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `r` is a string containing unique characters from `encoded` in sorted order, `mapping` is a dictionary where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in reverse order of `r`.**

Explanation: The code creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in the string `r` is mapped to the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`. For example, if `r` is "abc", then `mapping` will be {'a': 'c', 'b': 'b', 'c': 'a'}. The values of `encoded` and `r` remain unchanged.
