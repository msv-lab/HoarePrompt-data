You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

- Program:
from math import log2

def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:
                print(2 ** power)
            else:
                power -= 1
                print(2 ** power)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `n_cases` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and prints the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` is 1, it prints 1. If `n` is exactly a power of 2, it prints the next power of 2. The function does not return any value and does not modify any external variables. After all test cases are processed, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Initial Array Setup**: The array `a` is initialized such that `a[i] = i` for each `1 ≤ i ≤ n`. This means the array starts as `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`.

2. **Swap Operation**: The operation `swap(k)` for an integer `k ≥ 2` swaps the elements at positions `d` and `k`, where `d` is the largest divisor of `k` that is not `k` itself. For a number `k`, the largest divisor `d` is `k // 2`.

3. **Effect of Swaps**: When performing `swap(i)` for each `i` from `2` to `n`:
   - For `i = 2`, `d = 1` and the array becomes `[2, 1, 3, 4, ..., n]`.
   - For `i = 3`, `d = 1` and the array becomes `[3, 1, 2, 4, ..., n]`.
   - For `i = 4`, `d = 2` and the array becomes `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5, ..., n]`.
   - For `i = 5`, `d = 1` and the array becomes `[5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 6, ..., n]`.
   - For `i = 6`, `d = 3` and the array becomes `[5, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2, 7, ..., n]`.
   - And so on...

4. **Pattern Observation**: 
   - The element `1` is initially at position `1`.
   - Each time `i` is a power of `2` (i.e., `2, 4, 8, 16, ...`), the element `1` is moved to the position `i`.
   - For other values of `i`, `1` is not moved to a new position but remains at the last position it was moved to by a power of `2`.

5. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The program first reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - If `n == 1`, the array is `[1]` and the position of `1` is `1`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the largest power of `2` that is less than or equal to `n` using `log2(n)`.
   - If `n` is exactly a power of `2`, then `1` will be at position `2 ** power`.
   - If `n` is not a power of `2`, then `1` will be at the position of the largest power of `2` less than `n`, which is `2 ** (power - 1)`.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n == 1`.
   - The program correctly calculates the largest power of `2` less than or equal to `n` using `log2(n)`.
   - The program correctly determines the position of `1` based on whether `n` is a power of `2` or not.

However, there is a small issue in the program:
- The condition `if power == n` should be `if 2 ** power == n` to check if `n` is exactly a power of `2`.

Given this, the program is almost correct but has a minor logical error.

Correctness: **False**
