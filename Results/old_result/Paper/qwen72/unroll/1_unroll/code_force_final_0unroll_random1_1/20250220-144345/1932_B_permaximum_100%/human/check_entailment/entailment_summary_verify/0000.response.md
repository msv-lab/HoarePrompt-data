### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The signs occur periodically, and each sign must occur strictly after the previous one.
   - The goal is to find the year when the n-th sign occurs, which is the year of the apocalypse.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a` of the signs.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for calculating the year when the n-th sign occurs.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - It then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - If `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, it sets `next_year` to `current_year + ai`.
   - Otherwise, it sets `next_year` to the next multiple of `ai` after `current_year`.
   - It updates `current_year` to `next_year` and continues to the next sign.
   - Finally, it appends `current_year` to the results list.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of `t` integers, where each integer represents the smallest year greater than or equal to 0 that is a multiple of all the integers in the corresponding test case.
   - This summary is incorrect. The function does not return the smallest year that is a multiple of all integers in the test case. Instead, it returns the year when the n-th sign occurs, which is the year of the apocalypse.

5. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the program does not correctly handle the case where the signs occur in a way that the next sign's periodicity is a multiple of the current year.
   - The example provided is:
     ```
     1
     3
     2 4 8
     ```
   - The expected output is `8`, but the program outputs `10`.

6. **Verification**:
   - Let's verify the program with the provided example:
     - `current_year` starts at 0.
     - For the first sign (periodicity 2):
       - `current_year % 2 == 0` is False.
       - `next_year = (0 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`.
       - `current_year` is updated to 2.
     - For the second sign (periodicity 4):
       - `current_year % 4 == 0` is False.
       - `next_year = (2 // 4 + 1) * 4 = 4`.
       - `current_year` is updated to 4.
     - For the third sign (periodicity 8):
       - `current_year % 8 == 0` is False.
       - `next_year = (4 // 8 + 1) * 8 = 8`.
       - `current_year` is updated to 8.
     - The final `current_year` is 8, which is the correct output.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is incorrect. The program does handle the case where the next sign's periodicity is a multiple of the current year correctly.
   - The program correctly calculates the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
