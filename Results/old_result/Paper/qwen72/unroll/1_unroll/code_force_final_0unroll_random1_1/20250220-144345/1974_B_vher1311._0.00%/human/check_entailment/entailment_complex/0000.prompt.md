Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

# Annotated Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        encoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(encoded_str)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s is a positive integer such that 1 <= len(s) <= 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(list({char for char in s}))
    i, j = 0, len(unique_chars) - 1
    for char in s:
        if char in unique_chars:
            s = s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])
            j -= 1
        else:
            unique_chars.insert(i, char)
            i += 1
            j += 1
        
    #State: All characters in `s` are replaced by the last unique character in `unique_chars` before the loop starts, and `unique_chars` contains all the characters that were originally in `s`, sorted in the order they appeared in `s` before the loop started. `i` is the length of `unique_chars`, and `j` is 0.
    return ''.join(unique_chars)
    #The program returns a string containing all the unique characters from `s`, sorted in the order they appeared in `s` before the loop started.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a string containing all the unique characters from `s`, in the order they first appeared. The function modifies the input string `s` by replacing each character with the last unique character in the sorted list of unique characters from `s`. However, the final state of the program is such that the returned string is a sorted list of unique characters from `s`, in the order they appeared in the original string.
