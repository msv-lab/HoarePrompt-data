Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized to `False`, and `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**

The code `coef = [None] * n` reassigns the variable `coef` to a new list of `None` values of length `n`, which was already the initial state of `coef`. Therefore, the state of `coef` remains unchanged, and all other variables retain their initial values.
