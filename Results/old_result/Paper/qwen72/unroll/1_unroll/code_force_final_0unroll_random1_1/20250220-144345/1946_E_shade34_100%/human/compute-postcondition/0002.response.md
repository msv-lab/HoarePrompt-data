The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `a`, which is an integer, and `b`, which is a list of integers with a non-negative length. The function returns the result of `c * a % 1000000007`, where `c` is one of the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b`. It returns the result of multiplying `a` by a value `c` (where `c` is one of the values returned by `func_1(b, 1000000007)`) and then taking the result modulo 1000000007.**
