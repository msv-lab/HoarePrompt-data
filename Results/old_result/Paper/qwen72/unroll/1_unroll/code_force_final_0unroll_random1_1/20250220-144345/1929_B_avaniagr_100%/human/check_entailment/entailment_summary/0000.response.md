### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads from standard input and processes each test case starting from the second line (skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases).
   - It splits each line into two integers `n` and `k`, which represent the size of the grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell, respectively.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program uses a conditional structure to determine the minimum number of cells to color based on the value of `k`:
     - If `k <= 4 * n - 4`, it prints `math.ceil(k / 2)`.
     - If `k == 4 * n - 3`, it prints `2 * n - 1`.
     - If `k == 4 * n - 2`, it prints `2 * n`.

3. **Mathematical Justification**:
   - For a grid of size `n x n`, there are `2 * n - 1` main diagonals (from top-left to bottom-right) and `2 * n - 1` anti-diagonals (from top-right to bottom-left), making a total of `4 * n - 2` diagonals.
   - To cover `k` diagonals with the minimum number of cells:
     - If `k <= 2 * n - 1`, we can cover `k` diagonals by coloring `math.ceil(k / 2)` cells. This is because each cell can cover two diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - If `k > 2 * n - 1` and `k <= 4 * n - 4`, we need to color more cells to cover the additional diagonals. The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` still holds because it ensures that we cover the required number of diagonals.
     - If `k == 4 * n - 3`, we need to color `2 * n - 1` cells. This is because we need to cover all but one diagonal, and the most efficient way to do this is to color all cells in one row or column.
     - If `k == 4 * n - 2`, we need to color `2 * n` cells. This is because we need to cover all diagonals, and the most efficient way to do this is to color all cells in one row and one column.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 3` and `4 * n - 2` correctly.
   - The program also handles the general case where `k` is less than or equal to `4 * n - 4` correctly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the correct minimum number of cells for each test case as specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of cells that need to be colored for each test case based on the provided problem description and the execution summary. The logic and mathematical reasoning are sound, and the program handles all edge cases and general cases appropriately.
