### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - The program then calls the function `func_1(s)` for each test case and prints the results.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `n` is set to the length of the string `s`.
     - `A` and `idx_A` are initialized as empty lists to store the cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
     - `B` and `idx_B` are initialized as empty lists to store the cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.

   - **First Loop (for '>' characters):**
     - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
     - If the character at index `i` is '>', it calculates the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered so far and appends it to `A`.
     - It also appends the index `i` to `idx_A`.

   - **Second Loop (for '<' characters):**
     - The loop iterates through the string `s` from right to left.
     - If the character at index `i` is '<', it calculates the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered so far and appends it to `B`.
     - It also appends the index `i` to `idx_B`.

   - **Third Loop (Calculating Results):**
     - The loop iterates through the string `s` from left to right.
     - It uses the cumulative counts and indices stored in `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, and `idx_B` to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed at each cell.
     - The calculations are based on the direction of the pinball and the cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the results for each test case, with each result being a series of integers representing the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.

### Analysis:
- **Correctness of the First Loop:**
  - The loop correctly identifies and processes '>' characters, storing the cumulative counts and indices in `A` and `idx_A`.
  - This part of the function is correct.

- **Correctness of the Second Loop:**
  - The loop correctly identifies and processes '<' characters, storing the cumulative counts and indices in `B` and `idx_B`.
  - This part of the function is correct.

- **Correctness of the Third Loop:**
  - The loop correctly calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the direction of the pinball and the cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters.
  - The logic for handling different cases (when `l < r`, `r == 0`, `l > r`, etc.) is complex but appears to be correctly implemented to cover all scenarios.
  - The calculations take into account the distance traveled by the pinball and the number of times the direction changes, which is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The cumulative counts and indices are used appropriately to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell. The program handles all edge cases and the logic is consistent with the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
