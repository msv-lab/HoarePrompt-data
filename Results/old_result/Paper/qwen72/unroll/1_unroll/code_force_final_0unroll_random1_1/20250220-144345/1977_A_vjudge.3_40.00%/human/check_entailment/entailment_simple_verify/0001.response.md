### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Nikita can either add or remove one cube per move.
   - After \( n \) moves, we need to determine if the tower can have exactly \( m \) cubes.
   - The initial tower has 0 cubes.

2. **Possible Outcomes:**
   - If \( n \) is the number of moves, the number of cubes in the tower after \( n \) moves can range from \( 0 \) to \( n \) (if all moves are adding cubes).
   - The number of cubes in the tower can also be any odd or even number within this range, depending on the sequence of adding and removing cubes.

3. **Conditions to Check:**
   - **\( n = m \):** If the number of moves \( n \) is equal to the number of cubes \( m \), Nikita can simply add \( n \) cubes in \( n \) moves. This is always possible.
   - **\( m > n \):** If the number of cubes \( m \) is greater than the number of moves \( n \), it is impossible to have \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.
   - **\( m = n - 1 \):** If the number of cubes \( m \) is exactly one less than the number of moves \( n \), Nikita can add \( n - 1 \) cubes and then remove one cube. This is always possible.
   - **\( m \) and \( n \) both even or both odd:** If both \( m \) and \( n \) are even or both are odd, it is possible to achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves. This is because the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes in the tower will match the parity of the number of moves.
   - **Otherwise:** If \( m \) and \( n \) have different parities, it is impossible to achieve \( m \) cubes after \( n \) moves.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( m \).
   - It checks the conditions:
     - If \( n = m \), it prints "Yes".
     - If \( m > n \), it prints "No".
     - If \( m = n - 1 \), it prints "Yes".
     - If both \( m \) and \( n \) are even, it prints "Yes".
     - If both \( m \) and \( n \) are odd, it prints "Yes".
     - Otherwise, it prints "No".

5. **Verification:**
   - The conditions cover all possible scenarios:
     - \( n = m \) is correctly handled.
     - \( m > n \) is correctly handled.
     - \( m = n - 1 \) is correctly handled.
     - Parity checks for both even and odd cases are correctly handled.
   - The program does not miss any edge cases or logical errors.

### Annotated Code Evaluation:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
- The conditions in the loop are logically sound and cover all necessary cases.
- The final state of \( n \) and \( m \) is undefined as they are reassigned in each iteration, which is expected and correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct and handles all the conditions as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
Final: **True**
