### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `arr` of `n` integers.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values for each element in `arr`.
   - It also initializes `minn` to 0, which represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of the integers that have been used in the permutation.

3. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The program iterates through each element in `arr` and constructs the permutation `mex` based on the value of `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it means `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i` is positive. Therefore, `p_i` must be the current `minn` (the smallest unused integer), and `mex` is updated with `minn`. The `used` dictionary is then updated to mark `minn` as used, and `minn` is incremented to the next smallest unused integer.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it means `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i` is non-positive. Therefore, `p_i` must be `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, and `mex` is updated with this value. The `used` dictionary is then updated to mark this value as used.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `mex` for each test case, with each integer separated by a space.
   - After printing the permutation for a test case, it prints an empty line to separate the outputs of different test cases.

### Verification:
- The program correctly constructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` based on the MEX definition.
- The logic for updating `mex` and `used` is sound and follows the problem constraints.
- The program ensures that all integers from 0 to `n-1` are used exactly once in the permutation.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
