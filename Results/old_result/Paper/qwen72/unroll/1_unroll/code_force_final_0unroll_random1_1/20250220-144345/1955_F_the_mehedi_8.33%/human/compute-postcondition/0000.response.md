The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used as a placeholder to iterate over the range. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations. For the loop to execute, the value of `int(input())` must be greater than 0.

Given the problem description, the number of test cases `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. This means that the value of `int(input())` should be `t` for the loop to execute the correct number of times.

State: **`_` is a placeholder variable, `int(input())` must be `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
