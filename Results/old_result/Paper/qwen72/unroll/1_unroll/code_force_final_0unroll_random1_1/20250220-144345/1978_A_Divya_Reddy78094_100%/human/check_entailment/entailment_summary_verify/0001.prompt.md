You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums` from the input. It then prints the sum of the maximum value in the list `nums` (excluding the last element) and the last element of the list `nums`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `nums` are reset for each test case, and the function does not modify any external variables or state.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires dividing a list of books into two non-empty piles such that Alice reads the book with the highest number of pages from each pile. The goal is to maximize the total number of pages read by Alice.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `nums`.

3. **Solution Logic**:
   - The program uses the expression `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]` to determine the maximum number of pages Alice can read.
   - `nums[:-1]` creates a list of all books except the last one.
   - `max(nums[:-1])` finds the book with the highest number of pages from the first pile (all books except the last one).
   - `nums[-1]` is the last book, which is always in the second pile.
   - The sum of these two values is the total number of pages Alice can read.

4. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic assumes that the last book is always in the second pile and the book with the highest number of pages from the remaining books is in the first pile.
   - This approach is correct because the problem is to maximize the sum of the highest pages in each pile. By placing the last book in one pile and the highest of the rest in the other pile, we ensure that the two largest values are used, which is the optimal solution.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the minimum number of books (2) correctly.
   - It also handles larger numbers of books (up to 100) correctly by always selecting the last book and the highest of the rest.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Correctness: **True**
