You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input arguments, but the problem description implies that the function should be part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the sequence. The number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: The loop has finished executing all iterations, and for each test case, the variable `cnt` has been calculated and printed. The value of `cnt` for each test case is the sum of 1 (if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd) and the floor division of each element in `a` by 2. The input variables and the loop control variable `_` are no longer relevant after the loop completes.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the optimal strategy for Eve to maximize Bob's wins. The logic in the program is flawed because it does not account for the bitwise XOR of the sequence and how removing specific numbers can affect the XOR result to ensure Bob wins as many times as possible.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 1 1
```
The correct output should be `2` because Eve can remove the numbers in such a way that Bob wins twice. However, the program will output `3`, which is incorrect.

The correct approach should involve calculating the XOR of the sequence and then determining the optimal number of elements to remove to ensure the XOR remains zero as many times as possible. The current program does not do this and thus is incorrect.
