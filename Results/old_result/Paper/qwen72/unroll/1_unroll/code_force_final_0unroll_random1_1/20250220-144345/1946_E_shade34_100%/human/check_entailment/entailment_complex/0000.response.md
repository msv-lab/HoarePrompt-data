### Reasoning:

1. **Factorial Precomputation:**
   - The program starts by precomputing factorials up to 200,000 and storing them in the list `facts`. This is necessary for efficiently computing the number of permutations.
   - The computation of factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is done correctly.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the indices of the suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Initial Validation:**
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum index `p[-1]` is equal to the first suffix maximum index `s[0]`, and if the first prefix maximum index `p[0]` is 1 and the last suffix maximum index `s[-1]` is `n`.
   - If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, which is correct because these conditions are necessary for a valid permutation.

4. **Suffix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 and `kol` to `n`.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximum indices `s` and computes the number of ways to arrange the elements in the gaps between the suffix maximums.
   - The function `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse of the factorial values, which is necessary for the combination formula.

5. **Prefix Maximums Processing:**
   - The program initializes `kol` to `s[0] - 1` and creates a reversed list `p2` of the prefix maximum indices (excluding the last one).
   - It iterates over `p2` and computes the number of ways to arrange the elements in the gaps between the prefix maximums.
   - Again, `func_2` is used to compute the modular inverse of the factorial values.

6. **Gaps Between Maximums:**
   - The program multiplies `ans` by the factorial of the gaps between consecutive prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - This is done to account for the permutations of the elements within these gaps.

7. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the final value of `ans` for each test case, which is the number of suitable permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Function Analysis:
- **`func_1`**:
  - This function is used to compute the modular inverse of a number. It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the inverse.
  - The function is correctly implemented and handles all edge cases (e.g., when `b` is 0, when `a` is less than `b`, etc.).

- **`func_2`**:
  - This function computes the result of `a * (b's modular inverse) % 1000000007`.
  - It correctly uses `func_1` to find the modular inverse and then performs the multiplication and modulo operation.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of suitable permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. It handles all edge cases and uses the precomputed factorials and modular inverses efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
