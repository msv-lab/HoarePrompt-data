### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the sum of an array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than 5 * 10^5 times.
   - The operation involves setting a subarray `a[l:r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function handles the case where the subarray `a[l:r]` is being processed.
     - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0. If not, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray `a[l+1:r]` and then checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If not, it sets the entire subarray `a[l:r]` to `r - l + 1` and adds the operation to `ops`.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls the recursive function `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array.
     - It returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function calculates the sum of the subarray `a[l:r]` and compares it to the maximum possible sum of the subarray, which is `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`.
     - If the current sum is less than or equal to the maximum possible sum, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value and adds the operation to `ops`.
     - Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and its position, then recursively processes the subarrays to the left and right of this maximum value.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, processes the array using `func_2`, and prints the results.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The MEX calculation in `func_1` is not explicitly shown in the code. The function assumes that the MEX of a subarray `a[l:r]` is `r - l + 1` if the subarray is not already maximized. This assumption is not always correct.
   - For example, consider the subarray `[1, 2, 3]`. The MEX of this subarray is 0, not 3. The function `func_1` incorrectly sets the subarray to 3, which is not the MEX.
   - The recursive approach in `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly handle the MEX calculation. It only checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, which is not a valid condition for determining the MEX.
   - The function `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` do not correctly identify the MEX for a subarray, leading to incorrect operations and potentially suboptimal results.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the subarray length is 1 by setting the element to 0 if it is not already 0. This is correct.
   - However, it fails to handle other cases where the MEX is not `r - l + 1`.

5. **Optimization**:
   - The recursive approach is intended to ensure that the operations are applied in a way that maximizes the sum without exceeding the operation limit.
   - However, the incorrect MEX calculation can lead to an excessive number of operations or suboptimal results.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem because it incorrectly calculates the MEX for subarrays. The MEX calculation is a crucial part of the problem, and the current implementation does not handle it correctly. This leads to incorrect operations and potentially suboptimal results.

Final: **False**
