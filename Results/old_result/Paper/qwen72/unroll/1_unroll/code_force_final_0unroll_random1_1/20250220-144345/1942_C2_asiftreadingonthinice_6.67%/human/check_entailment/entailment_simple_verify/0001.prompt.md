You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is not properly defined for the problem. The correct function definition should be `def max_triangular_pieces(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):` where `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: The loop iterates `tt` times, and for each iteration, it reads input values for `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` chosen vertices. It then calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by choosing additional vertices, ensuring that no two chosen vertices are adjacent. The final result for each test case is printed as the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`. After all iterations, the variables `tt` and `ii` will have been decremented to 0, and the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, and `ans` will be overwritten in each iteration. The list `tmp` will be reset to an empty list at the start of each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - We can choose up to \( y \) additional vertices.
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

2. **Initial Setup:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads the \( x \) chosen vertices and sorts them.

3. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial answer \( ans \) is set to \( x + y - 2 \). This is because each triangle is formed by 3 vertices, and we start with \( x \) vertices and can add up to \( y \) more. The \( -2 \) accounts for the fact that the first triangle is formed by 3 vertices, and each additional vertex can form one more triangle.

4. **Handling Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to find gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to \( ans \) because a single diagonal can be drawn to form a triangle.
   - If the gap is even and greater than 2, it checks if we have enough remaining \( y \) vertices to fill the gap. If so, it adds the number of triangles that can be formed by the gap and updates \( y \).

5. **Handling the Gap Between the Last and First Vertex:**
   - The program checks the gap between the last and the first vertex (considering the polygon is cyclic).
   - Similar to the previous step, it adds 1 to \( ans \) if the gap is exactly 2.
   - If the gap is even and greater than 2, it checks if we have enough remaining \( y \) vertices to fill the gap and updates \( ans \) and \( y \).

6. **Final Answer Calculation:**
   - The program adds the remaining \( y \) vertices to \( ans \) because each additional vertex can form one more triangle.
   - It prints the minimum of \( ans \) and \( n - 2 \) because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles in a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( n - 2 \).

### Issues in the Program:
- **Indexing Error:**
  - In the line `elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:`, the index `i` is used incorrectly. It should be `a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]` instead of `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

- **Redundant Calculation:**
  - The line `tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)` is unnecessary and can be removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    tt = int(input())
    for ii in range(tt):
        (n, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        ans = x + y - 2
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
                ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
                y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            ans += (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1
        ans += y
        print(min(ans, n - 2))
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the program is logically correct and handles all edge cases.
- **False** if there are logical errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly.

Given the issues identified and the corrections made, the program should now correctly handle the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
