### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions of the field `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes a dictionary `players` to store the positions of the players and a dictionary `goals` to store the positions of the goals for each team.
   - It defines a dictionary `mouvements` to map the movement directions to their respective changes in coordinates.
   - It calculates the middle of the field `middle` correctly.
   - It initializes the `quidditch` list to store the current position of the Quaffle and the player carrying it.

2. **Field Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the field and populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries.
   - It correctly handles the Quaffle's initial position.

3. **Movement Function:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to update the position of an entity based on the movement direction. However, the function summary provided is incorrect. The function `func_1` actually takes a tuple `a` representing a position and a tuple `b` representing a movement direction. It correctly returns the new position as a tuple.

4. **Action Handling:**
   - The program correctly processes the number of moves `moves`.
   - For each move, it correctly updates the position of the entity performing the action.
   - It handles the elimination of players who encounter the Bludger:
     - It correctly checks if a player is on the same cell as the Bludger.
     - It sorts the eliminated players alphabetically and prints the elimination events.
     - It correctly handles the Quaffle if the eliminated player was carrying it.
   - It handles the catching of the Quaffle:
     - There is indeed a typo in the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]`. It should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player to the Quaffle carrier.
   - It handles the throwing of the Quaffle:
     - It correctly checks if the Quaffle is thrown into the opponent's goal and updates the score accordingly.
     - It correctly prints the scoring events.
     - It correctly resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field if a valid goal is scored.

5. **Final Score:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

### Correctness:
- The program has a minor typo in the catching logic (`quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`).
- The function summary provided for `func_1` is incorrect and misleading. The function actually works correctly with the given implementation.
- The program does not handle the case where a player tries to throw the Quaffle when they are not carrying it, but the problem statement guarantees that all actions are valid.
- The program correctly handles the elimination of players and the scoring of goals.
- The final score is printed correctly.

Given the above reasoning, the program is almost correct but has a small typo. Fixing the typo will make it fully correct.

### Final: **False**

To make the program correct, the line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be changed to `quidditch[1] = mo[0]`.
