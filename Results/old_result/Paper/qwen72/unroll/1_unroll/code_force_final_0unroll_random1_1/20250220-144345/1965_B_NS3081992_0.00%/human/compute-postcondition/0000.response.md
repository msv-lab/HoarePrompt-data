The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the function `func_10()`. The loop's execution depends on the value returned by `func_10()`. For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a value greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used to iterate over the range, and it does not need to be adjusted since it is not used in the loop head.

State: **`func_10()` must return a value greater than 0, `_` is a throwaway variable and does not need to be adjusted**
