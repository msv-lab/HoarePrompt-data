Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain values of `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 53`:
- According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that sums to 53 is "azz" (1 + 26 + 26 = 53).
- However, the program will output "bzz" (2 + 26 + 26 = 54) because it uses the condition `if n > 52` and adds `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`, which results in "bzz" instead of "azz".

Another example is `n = 27`:
- The lexicographically smallest word that sums to 27 is "abz" (1 + 2 + 24 = 27).
- However, the program will output "aaa" (1 + 1 + 1 = 3) because it uses the condition `if n > 26` and adds `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`, which results in "aaa" instead of "abz".

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly handle all potential cases, making it incorrect.
