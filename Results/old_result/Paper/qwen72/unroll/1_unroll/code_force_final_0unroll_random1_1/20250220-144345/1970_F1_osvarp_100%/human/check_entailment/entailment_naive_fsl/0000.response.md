Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where a player scores in their own goal correctly. According to the problem description, if a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team should win a point. However, the program does not account for this scenario. For example, if a red player (R0) moves to a red goal (RG) and throws the Quaffle, the program will incorrectly print "RED GOAL" instead of "BLUE GOAL". This violates the requirement that scoring in the wrong goal should award the point to the opposing team.
