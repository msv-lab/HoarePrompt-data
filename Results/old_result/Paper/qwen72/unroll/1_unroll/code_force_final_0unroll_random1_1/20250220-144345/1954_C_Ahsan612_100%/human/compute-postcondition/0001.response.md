Output State: **For each test case, the loop will output two lines. The first line will contain the maximum digit at each position from the two input numbers up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit for the remaining positions. The second line will contain the minimum digit at each position from the two input numbers up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit for the remaining positions. The variables `t`, `x`, and `y` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.**
