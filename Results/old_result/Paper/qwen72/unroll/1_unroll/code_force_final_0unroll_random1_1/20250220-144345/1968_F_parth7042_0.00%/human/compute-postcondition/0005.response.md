The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted. The state of `idx`, `n`, `q`, `a`, `data`, and `results` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is the integer value of `data[0]` and must be greater than 0, `n` and `q` are integers where 2 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= `q` <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 0 <= `a_i` < 2^30, and each query is a pair of integers (l, r) where 1 <= l < r <= n. The sum of `n` over all test cases and the sum of `q` over all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^5. `data` is a list of strings from the input, `results` is an empty list.**
