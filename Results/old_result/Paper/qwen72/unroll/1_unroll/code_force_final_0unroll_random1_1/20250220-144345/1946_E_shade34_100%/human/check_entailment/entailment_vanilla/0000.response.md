To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze it in the context of the problem description and ensure that it meets all the requirements and constraints.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Permutation and Maximums**:
   - A permutation of length \( n \) is an array where each integer from 1 to \( n \) occurs exactly once.
   - Prefix maximums are elements that are the maximum in the prefix ending at that element.
   - Suffix maximums are elements that are the maximum in the suffix starting at that element.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides the length of the permutation \( n \), the number of prefix maximums \( m_1 \), and the number of suffix maximums \( m_2 \).
   - The indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums are given in increasing order.
   - The output for each test case is the number of suitable permutations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function 1: `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = \gcd(a, b) \).
   - The function returns a tuple \((c, d)\) where \( c \) and \( d \) are the coefficients.
   - The function handles the case where \( b = 0 \) and returns \((1, 0)\).
   - It also handles the case where \( a < b \) by swapping \( a \) and \( b \).
   - If \( a \) is divisible by \( b \), it returns \((1, -(a // b - 1))\).
   - Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with \( b \) and \( a \% b \) and computes the coefficients accordingly.

2. **Function 2: `func_2(a, b)`**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of \( b \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - The modular inverse of \( b \) is the value \( c \) such that \( b \cdot c \equiv 1 \pmod{10^9 + 7} \).
   - It returns \( c \cdot a \mod 10^9 + 7 \).

### Correctness of the Program:
- **Function 1**:
  - The function correctly implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is essential for finding the modular inverse.
  - The base case and recursive steps are correctly handled.

- **Function 2**:
  - The function correctly computes the modular inverse using the result from `func_1`.
  - It then multiplies the modular inverse by \( a \) and returns the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

However, the program does not directly address the problem of counting the number of suitable permutations given the prefix and suffix maximums. The functions provided are for modular arithmetic, which is not directly related to the permutation counting problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not solve the given problem. It only contains functions for modular arithmetic, which are not sufficient to count the number of suitable permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
