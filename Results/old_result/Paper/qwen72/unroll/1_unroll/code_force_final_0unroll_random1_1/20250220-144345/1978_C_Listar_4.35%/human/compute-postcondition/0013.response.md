The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with `n` constrained to the range 1 to 200,000 (inclusive) and `k` constrained to the range 0 to 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). The function returns different values based on the following cases:

- Case_1: The function returns 0, 0.
- Case_2: The function returns 0, 0.
- Case_3: The function returns the integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to n^2 // 2, with `max_k` being greater than or equal to `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 <= n <= 200,000` and `0 <= k <= 1,000,000,000,000`. It returns 0, 0 in the first two cases. In the third case, it returns `n` and `k`, where `k` is an even integer, and `k` is less than or equal to `max_k`. `max_k` is calculated as (n^2 - 1) // 2 if `n` is odd, or n^2 // 2 if `n` is even.**
