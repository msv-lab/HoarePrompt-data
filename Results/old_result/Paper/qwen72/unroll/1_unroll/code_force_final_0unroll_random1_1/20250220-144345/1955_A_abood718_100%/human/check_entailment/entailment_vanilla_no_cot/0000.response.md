Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the promotion price for two yogurts is cheaper than buying them individually, but not the best option for all yogurts. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost when the number of yogurts is odd is flawed.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if 2 * a < b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            pairs = n // 2
            single = n % 2
            print(pairs * b + single * a)
```

This corrected version ensures that:
1. If the promotion price for two yogurts is more expensive than buying them individually, it calculates the total cost as `n * a`.
2. Otherwise, it calculates the cost for the maximum number of pairs of yogurts using the promotion price and adds the cost for any remaining single yogurt.

This approach correctly handles both even and odd numbers of yogurts and ensures the minimum cost is calculated accurately.
