The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `k`, and the list `cases`. The loop will execute if `cases` is not empty. The variables `n` and `k` will take the values from the first tuple in `cases` on the first iteration. The state of `t`, `results`, and `sequence` are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must have at least one tuple, and `n` and `k` will be initialized to the values of the first tuple in `cases`.

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, `results` is an empty list, `sequence` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^24, `n` is the first integer in the first tuple of `cases`, `k` is the second integer in the first tuple of `cases`**
