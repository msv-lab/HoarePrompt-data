The only objects in the loop head are the variables `i` and `n_cases`. For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is initialized by the loop itself, so it does not need to be adjusted. The function `func` and the array `a` are not part of the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted here.

State: **`n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
