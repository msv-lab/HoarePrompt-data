### Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Function Call:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to process the string and print the results for each cell.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - **Preprocessing:**
     - The function initializes two lists, `A` and `B`, to store cumulative counts of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - It also initializes two lists, `idx_A` and `idx_B`, to store the indices of '>' and '<' characters, respectively.
     - The first loop iterates through the string from left to right, building `A` and `idx_A`:
       - If the current character is '>', it calculates the cumulative count of '>' characters encountered so far, adjusted by the distance from the last '>' character and the number of '>' characters encountered so far.
       - The second loop iterates through the string from right to left, building `B` and `idx_B`:
       - If the current character is '<', it calculates the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered so far, adjusted by the distance from the last '<' character and the number of '<' characters encountered so far.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - The function then processes each cell in the string to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - It uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the current positions in `A` and `B`, respectively.
   - For each cell `i`:
     - If the character is '>', it calculates the time to leave the grid based on the cumulative counts and positions stored in `A` and `B`.
     - If the character is '<', it similarly calculates the time to leave the grid based on the cumulative counts and positions stored in `A` and `B`.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The program does handle edge cases where the pinball starts at the edge of the grid:
     - If the pinball starts at the first cell and the direction is '>', it correctly calculates the time to leave the grid.
     - If the pinball starts at the last cell and the direction is '<', it correctly calculates the time to leave the grid.
   - However, the original assessment mentions a specific edge case where the input string is `">"`. Let's verify this:
     - For the input `">"`, the program will:
       - Initialize `A` with `[0]` and `idx_A` with `[0]`.
       - Initialize `B` with `[0]` and `idx_B` with `[0]`.
       - For the first cell (i = 0), it will:
         - Check if `s[0]` is '>', which it is.
         - Since `l < r` is false (both are 0), it will print `n - i`, which is `1 - 0 = 1`.
     - This is the correct output for the input `">"`, indicating that the program does handle this edge case correctly.

5. **Complexity and Correctness:**
   - The logic in the program is indeed complex, but it appears to correctly account for the cumulative counts and positions of '>' and '<' characters.
   - The program's complexity is necessary to handle the cumulative effects of the pinball's movements and the inversion of characters.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was **inaccurate**. The program correctly handles the edge case where the input string is `">"`, and it appears to correctly calculate the time for the pinball to leave the grid for all other cases as well.
- The program's logic, while complex, is designed to handle the cumulative effects of the pinball's movements and the inversion of characters, which is necessary for the problem.

Final: **True**
