### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then reads the list of moments `arr` when messages need to be sent.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to keep track of the charge consumption for each message.
   - It iterates through the list of moments `arr` to calculate the charge consumption for each message.

3. **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
   - For the first message (`i == 0`), it checks if the time to send the message is less than the time it takes to turn off and on the phone (`b / a`). If so, it adds the charge consumption for the message to `array2`.
   - For subsequent messages, it checks if the time difference between the current and previous message is less than the time it takes to turn off and on the phone (`b / a`). If so, it adds the charge consumption for the message to `array2`.

4. **Total Charge Consumption:**
   - The program calculates the total charge consumption by summing the elements in `array2`.
   - It also accounts for the additional charge consumption due to turning the phone off and on for messages that are not in `array2` by adding `(n - len(array2)) * b` to the total charge consumption.
   - Finally, it compares the total charge consumption with the initial charge `f` to determine if Stepan can send all messages.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints "Yes" if the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`.
   - Otherwise, it prints "No".

### Issues:

1. **Charge Consumption Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly calculates the charge consumption for the first message. It should be `arr[0] * a` if `arr[0] < b / a`, but the program does not handle the case where `arr[0] >= b / a` correctly.
   - For subsequent messages, the program should check if the time difference between the current and previous message is less than `b / a` and add the charge consumption accordingly. However, it does not handle the case where the time difference is greater than or equal to `b / a` correctly.

2. **Logic for Turning Off and On:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the logic for turning the phone off and on. It should turn off the phone and turn it on again if the time difference between messages is greater than or equal to `b / a`, and this should be reflected in the charge consumption calculation.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the initial charge `f` is very large or the messages are sent at very large moments, which could lead to integer overflow issues.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        n = feat[0]
        f = feat[1]
        a = feat[2]
        b = feat[-1]
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        # Calculate the total charge consumption
        total_charge = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if i == 0:
                total_charge += arr[0] * a
            else:
                time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
                if time_diff < b / a:
                    total_charge += time_diff * a
                else:
                    total_charge += b
        
        # Check if the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge
        if total_charge <= f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

### Correctness:
- **False**: The provided program has logical errors in the charge consumption calculation and does not correctly handle the turning off and on actions. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem description.
