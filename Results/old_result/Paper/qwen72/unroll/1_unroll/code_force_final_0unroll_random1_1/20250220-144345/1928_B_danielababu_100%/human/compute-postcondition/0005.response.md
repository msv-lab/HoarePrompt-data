Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` which contains the products of all elements in `arr`, starting from the last element to the first.** 

In natural language, this means that the program will return a list where each element is the product of all the integers in the original list `arr`, but the order of these products in `ans` is reversed, starting from the product of all elements in `arr` up to the first element of `arr`. The list `arr` itself remains unchanged.
