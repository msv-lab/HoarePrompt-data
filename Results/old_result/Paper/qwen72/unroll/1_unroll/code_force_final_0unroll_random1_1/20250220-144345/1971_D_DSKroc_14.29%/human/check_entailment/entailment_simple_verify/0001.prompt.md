You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take an input, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. Based on the problem description, the function should take a single string `s` as input, where `s` is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: The loop will print the number of positions in each binary string `s` where a '1' is immediately followed by a '0', plus one, for each of the `t` iterations. The variable `t` will be unchanged, and the variable `s` will retain the value of the last input string provided.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find the minimum number of contiguous substrings (pieces) that a given binary string can be divided into, such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string. A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Solution**:
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.
   - It initializes a counter `count` to 0.
   - It iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second-to-last character.
   - For each character, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is greater than the next character `s[i + 1]`. Since `s` is a binary string, `s[i]` can only be '0' or '1', and `s[i + 1]` can only be '0' or '1'. The condition `int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1])` will be true only if `s[i]` is '1' and `s[i + 1]` is '0'.
   - If the condition is true, it increments the counter `count` by 1.
   - Finally, it prints `count + 1`.

3. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic is based on the observation that a sorted binary string should not have a '1' followed by a '0'. Each time we encounter a '1' followed by a '0', it indicates a point where we need to make a cut to separate the '1's and '0's.
   - The number of cuts needed is equal to the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'.
   - Adding 1 to the count of cuts gives the number of pieces, because each cut creates one additional piece.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), the program will correctly output 1.
   - If the string consists of only '0's or only '1's, the program will correctly output 1.
   - If the string is not sorted, the program will correctly count the number of '1' followed by '0' and output the correct number of pieces.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The program iterates through the string once, making it O(n) where n is the length of the string. This is efficient and within the constraints provided.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
