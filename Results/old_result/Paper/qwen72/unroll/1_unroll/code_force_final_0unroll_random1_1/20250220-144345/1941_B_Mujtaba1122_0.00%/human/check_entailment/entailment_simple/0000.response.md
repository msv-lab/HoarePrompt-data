### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Calls:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_2` with the array and its length `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list to zero using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., the middle elements of the list).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If the conditions are met, it performs the operation: `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`.

4. **Operation Logic:**
   - The operation `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`, `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` is incorrect.
   - The correct operation should be `list[i-1] -= 1`, `list[i] -= 2`, and `list[i+1] -= 1`.
   - The current implementation subtracts `list[i-1]` from each element, which is not the intended operation and will lead to incorrect results.

5. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the input `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`, the correct operations would be:
     - Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
     - Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
   - The program should print `YES` for this case, but the current implementation will not achieve this because of the incorrect operation logic.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program contains a logical error in the operation performed within `func_2`. The operation should subtract 1 from `list[i-1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i+1]`, but the current implementation subtracts `list[i-1]` from each element, which is incorrect. This will lead to incorrect results for the test cases.
