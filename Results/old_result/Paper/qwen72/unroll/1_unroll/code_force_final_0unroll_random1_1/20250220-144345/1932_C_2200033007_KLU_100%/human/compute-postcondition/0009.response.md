Output State: **The program returns the list `ans` in reversed order, where `ans` is a list of n integers, each representing the cumulative product of the elements in `b` taken in reverse order, modulo `m`. The list `b` contains the elements of `a` rearranged based on the characters in `s`, and `p` is the product of all elements in `b` modulo `m`.**
