Output State: **`custos` is a list containing the minimum cost for Kirill to bribe his way to a position no greater than `m` for each of the `t` test cases. The length of `custos` is equal to `x`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, `b_values`, and `x` are not directly modified by the loop, but `a_values` and `b_values` are populated from input for each test case.**
