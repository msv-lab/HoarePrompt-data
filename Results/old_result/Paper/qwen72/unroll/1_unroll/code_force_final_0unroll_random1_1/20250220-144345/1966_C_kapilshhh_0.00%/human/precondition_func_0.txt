The function should take two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n integers (1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5) representing the number of stones in each pile for a test case. Each integer in the inner lists (1 \le a_i \le 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot 10^5.
