The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions of a field, with the constraints that 3 <= a, b <= 99 and both `a` and `b` are odd. The function returns an error because `dx` and `dy` are not assigned, and `x` and `y` are not assigned.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are odd integers between 3 and 99, inclusive. It returns an error because `dx`, `dy`, `x`, and `y` are not assigned.**
