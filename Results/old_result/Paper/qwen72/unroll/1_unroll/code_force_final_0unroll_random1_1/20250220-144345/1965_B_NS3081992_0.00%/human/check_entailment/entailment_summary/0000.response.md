### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - `func_10()` reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, `func_14()` is called, which reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_7()`.

2. **Function `func_14()`**:
   - This function is responsible for generating the sequence `a` that meets the problem's conditions.
   - The function first converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations to determine the length of the binary strings.
   - If `k` is 1:
     - If `n` is 2, it returns the sequence `[1, 2]`.
     - Otherwise, it constructs a sequence starting with 2 and 3, and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - If `k` is not 1:
     - It constructs a sequence starting with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
     - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
     - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure the sequence can form all sums up to `n` except `k`.
     - Finally, it appends additional powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - `func_15()` iterates over the number of test cases and prints the result of `func_14()` for each test case.

### Analysis of `func_14()`:

- **Case `k == 1`**:
  - If `n == 2`, the sequence `[1, 2]` is returned, which meets the conditions since 1 is the only subsequence sum and 2 is not.
  - For `n > 2`, the sequence starts with 2 and 3, and then appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that all sums up to `n` are possible except for 1, which is not included in the sequence.

- **Case `k != 1`**:
  - The sequence starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
  - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not include `k`.
  - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to ensure the sequence can form all sums up to `n` except `k`.
  - Additional powers of 2 are appended to cover the range from `k` to `n`.

### Verification of Conditions:

- **No Subsequence with Sum `k`**:
  - The sequence is constructed to avoid any subsequence summing to `k` by carefully choosing elements and their sums.
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence does not include 1.
  - For `k != 1`, the sequence is constructed to avoid `k` while ensuring all other sums are possible.

- **All Sums `1 <= v <= n` Except `k`**:
  - The sequence includes elements that can form all sums up to `n` except `k`.
  - For `k == 1`, the sequence includes 2 and 3, and powers of 2, which can form all sums except 1.
  - For `k != 1`, the sequence includes `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1`, and additional powers of 2, ensuring all sums up to `n` are possible except `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly generates a sequence that meets the problem's conditions for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
