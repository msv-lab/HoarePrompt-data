Output State: **The program returns the integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 200,000 (inclusive), and `k` is an even integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000 (inclusive). Additionally, if `n` is odd, `max_k` is equal to (n^2 - 1) // 2, and if `n` is even, `max_k` is equal to n^2 // 2, with `max_k` being greater than or equal to `k`.**
