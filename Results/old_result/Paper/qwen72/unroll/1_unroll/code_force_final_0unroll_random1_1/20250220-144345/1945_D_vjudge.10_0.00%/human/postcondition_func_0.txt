The function reads multiple test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue `n`, the maximum allowable final position `m`, and two lists of integers `a` and `b` representing the costs to bribe individuals. It calculates and prints the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` for each test case. The function does not return any values; it only prints the results. After the function concludes, the state of the program includes the printed costs for each test case, and the input variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_values`, and `b_values` are not directly modified by the function.
