The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, and `cas_de_test`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple in `cas_de_test` contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30. The function returns a list `resultats` of integers, where each integer is either -1 or the number of ties (equalities) calculated for each tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`. Each tuple in `cas_de_test` contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3`. The function returns a list `resultats` where each element is either -1 if the tuple contains no ties, or the number of ties (equalities) found in the tuple.**
