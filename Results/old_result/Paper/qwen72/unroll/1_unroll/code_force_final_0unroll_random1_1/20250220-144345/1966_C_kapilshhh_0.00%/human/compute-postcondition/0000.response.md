Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and the list of lists contains the number of stones in each pile for each test case. Each integer in the inner lists (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) represents the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**
