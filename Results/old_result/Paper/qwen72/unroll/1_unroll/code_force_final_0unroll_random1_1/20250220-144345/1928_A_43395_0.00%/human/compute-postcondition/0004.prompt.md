You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, each with two integers a and b representing the dimensions of a rectangle. The inputs a and b for each test case satisfy 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9. The function should be able to handle up to 10^4 test cases.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
            print('no')
        elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: The function `func` processes all test cases, printing 'yes' for rectangles where both dimensions are even, and 'no' for all other cases. The variables `a` and `b` are updated for each test case, but their final values are not retained after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function processes multiple test cases, each with two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of a rectangle. It returns the area of the rectangle for each test case. If the function is designed to handle up to 10^4 test cases, it should return a list of areas corresponding to each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
