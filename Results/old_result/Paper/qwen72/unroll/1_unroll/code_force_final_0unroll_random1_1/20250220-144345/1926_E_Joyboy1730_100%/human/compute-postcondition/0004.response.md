Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It processes these values and prints a calculated result for each test case. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results to the console. After the function concludes, the input variables `t`, `n`, and `k` are not modified and retain their initial values for each test case. The list `L` and variables `tot` and `pow` are reset for each iteration. **
