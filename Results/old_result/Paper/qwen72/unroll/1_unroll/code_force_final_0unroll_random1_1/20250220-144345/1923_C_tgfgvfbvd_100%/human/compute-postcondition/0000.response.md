The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range determined by the input. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases `t`.

For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be a positive integer. This is because the number of test cases `t` is specified to be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). If `int(input())` is 0 or a negative integer, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `int(input())` is a positive integer, and the loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 (as it is the starting point of the range).

State: **`int(input())` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0**
