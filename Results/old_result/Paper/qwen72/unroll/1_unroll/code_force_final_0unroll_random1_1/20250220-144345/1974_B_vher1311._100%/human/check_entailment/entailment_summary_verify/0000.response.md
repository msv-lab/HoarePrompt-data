### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes the input to extract the number of test cases `t` and the details of each test case (length `n` and the encoded string `b`).
   - This approach is efficient and correctly handles the input format as described in the problem.

2. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Construction of `r`:**
     - The function constructs `r` by taking the set of unique characters from the encoded string `b`, sorting them, and joining them into a single string. This ensures that `r` contains all distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
     - This step is correct and aligns with the problem description.
   - **Mapping Creation:**
     - The function creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in `r`. The symmetric character is determined by the formula `r[-(i + 1)]`, which correctly pairs the first character with the last, the second with the second from the end, and so on.
     - This step is also correct and aligns with the problem description.
   - **Decoding the String:**
     - The function then decodes the string `b` by replacing each character with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.
     - This step is correct and ensures that the original string `s` is restored.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program collects the results of decoding each test case and prints them, separated by newlines. This matches the required output format.

### Evaluation of the Original Assessment:
- The original assessment states that the program is correct and provides a detailed explanation of why it works.
- The reasoning provided in the original assessment is accurate:
  - The program correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r`.
  - The mapping of characters is done correctly.
  - The decoding process is implemented as described in the problem.
  - The program handles multiple test cases and the input format correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
- Based on the systematic evaluation of the program's behavior and the function summary, the original assessment is accurate.
- The program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
