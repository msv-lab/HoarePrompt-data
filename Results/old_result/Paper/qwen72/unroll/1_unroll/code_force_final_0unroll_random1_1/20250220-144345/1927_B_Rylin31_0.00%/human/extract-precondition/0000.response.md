Precondition: **The function should accept two parameters: an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists a where each inner list contains n integers (0 \le a_i < n) representing the trace of a string. Each inner list corresponds to a test case, and the length of each inner list is n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

However, the function definition provided does not match the problem description. The function should be defined to accept the number of test cases and the traces of the strings. Here is a corrected function definition:

```python
def func(t, traces):
```

With this definition, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **t is an integer (1 \le t \le 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and traces is a list of lists where each inner list contains n integers (0 \le a_i < n) representing the trace of a string. The length of each inner list is n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**
