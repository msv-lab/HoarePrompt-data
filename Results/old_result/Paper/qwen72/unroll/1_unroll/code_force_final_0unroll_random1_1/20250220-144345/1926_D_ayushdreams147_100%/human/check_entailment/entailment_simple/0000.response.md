### Reasoning:

The problem requires dividing a list of integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two integers in the same group have matching bits in the 31 least significant bits. The key insight here is that if two integers \( x \) and \( y \) have the same bitwise complement (i.e., \( x \oplus ((1 << 31) - 1) = y \oplus ((1 << 31) - 1) \)), they can be paired together in the same group because their bits will be different in all positions from 1 to 31.

Let's break down the program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of integers \( n \) and the list of integers \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes `res` to 0, which will store the minimum number of groups required.
   - It uses a dictionary `count` to keep track of the bitwise complements of the integers in the list.
   - For each integer `num` in the list `a`:
     - If `num` is not in the dictionary `count`, it adds the bitwise complement of `num` to the dictionary and increments `res` by 1.
     - If `num` is already in the dictionary, it decrements the count of `num` in the dictionary. If the count becomes zero, it removes `num` from the dictionary.

3. **State Before Function Call:**
   - `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \).
   - `a` is a list of \( n \) integers where \( 0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} \).

4. **State Inside Function:**
   - `res` is the number of unique integers in the list `a` that have not been completely paired.
   - `count` is a dictionary where each key is the bitwise complement of an integer in `a` that has not been completely paired, and the values represent the count of these complements.

5. **Return Value:**
   - The function returns `res`, which is the number of unique integers in the list `a` that have not been completely paired.

### Analysis:

- **Correctness of the Logic:**
  - The program correctly pairs integers with their bitwise complements.
  - If an integer `num` is found in the dictionary, it means its complement has already been seen, and they can be paired together, reducing the count of the complement.
  - If an integer `num` is not found in the dictionary, it means its complement has not been seen yet, so it is added to the dictionary, and `res` is incremented.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the case where all integers are the same (e.g., all zeros or all \( 2^{31} - 1 \)).
  - It also handles the case where the list contains a mix of integers and their complements.

- **Output:**
  - The output is the number of unique integers that have not been completely paired, which is the minimum number of groups required.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
