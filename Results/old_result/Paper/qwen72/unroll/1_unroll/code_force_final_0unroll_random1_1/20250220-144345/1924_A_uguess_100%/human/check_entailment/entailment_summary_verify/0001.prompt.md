You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        ans = ''
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
                ans += ss
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
                    break
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes up to `t` test cases, where each test case involves an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a string `s` of length `m`. The string `s` consists only of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, the function checks if the string `s` contains at least `n` complete sets of all `k` distinct characters. If it does, the function prints 'YES'. If it does not, the function prints 'NO' followed by a modified string `ans` that includes the first missing character to complete a set, followed by 'a' repeated `(n - cnt - 1)` times, where `cnt` is the number of complete sets found in `s`. After processing all test cases, the function concludes.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

3. **Subsequence Checking:**
   - The program uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters in `s`.
   - `cur` is a bitmask where each bit represents whether a character from 'a' to 'a' + `k` - 1 has been seen in the current subsequence.
   - `cnt` keeps track of the number of complete subsequences of length `n` that have been found.

4. **Bitmask Update:**
   - For each character `ss` in `s`, the program calculates `cur_ss` which is the position of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
   - It updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character if it hasn't been included yet.
   - If `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence, and `cnt` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' because it means all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`:
     - It finds a character that is not present in the current subsequence using the bitmask `cur`.
     - It appends this character to `ans` and then appends 'a' enough times to make the string of length `n`.

6. **Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string that is not a subsequence of `s`.
   - The logic for constructing the string is flawed. It appends a character that is not in the current subsequence and then appends 'a' multiple times, which may not be a valid non-subsequence string.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, print 'NO' and that string.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program's logic for constructing a string that is not a subsequence is incorrect. It does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid non-subsequence string. Additionally, the program does not generate all possible strings of length `n` to check if they are subsequences of `s`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def is_subsequence(s, pattern):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in pattern)

def generate_all_strings(n, k):
    from itertools import product
    return [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        all_strings = generate_all_strings(n, k)
        for pattern in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, pattern):
                print('NO')
                print(pattern)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **is_subsequence Function:**
   - This function checks if a given `pattern` is a subsequence of `s` by using an iterator to ensure the order of characters is maintained.

2. **generate_all_strings Function:**
   - This function generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets using `itertools.product`.

3. **Main Function:**
   - For each test case, it generates all possible strings of length `n`.
   - It checks if each string is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, it prints 'NO' and that string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, it prints 'YES'.
