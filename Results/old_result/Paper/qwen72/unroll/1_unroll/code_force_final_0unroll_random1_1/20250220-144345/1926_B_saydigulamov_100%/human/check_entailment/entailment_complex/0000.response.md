Reasoning:

The program reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads the size of the grid and the grid itself. It then counts the number of '1's in each row that contains at least one '1' and stores these counts in a list `k`. The program checks if the first and second elements in `k` are equal. If they are, it prints 'SQUARE'; otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

However, this approach is flawed because it only checks the counts of '1's in the first two rows that contain '1's, which is not sufficient to determine the shape of the entire grid. For example, a triangle with a base of 3 '1's in the first row and 5 '1's in the second row would incorrectly be identified as a square by this program. Similarly, a square with the first two rows containing 2 '1's each would be incorrectly identified as a triangle if the third row contains a different number of '1's.

To correctly identify the shape, the program should:
1. Check if the counts of '1's in all rows form a sequence that matches the pattern of a triangle (either increasing or decreasing by 2 for each row).
2. Check if the counts of '1's in all rows are the same, indicating a square.

Given the current implementation, the program does not perform these checks and relies on a flawed logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
