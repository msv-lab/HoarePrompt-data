The only objects in the loop head are the variable `t` and the result of `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, the result of `int(input())` must be greater than 0, and `t` should start at 0.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4
- For each test case, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2·min(n, m), and k is even
- `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6
- `b` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_j ≤ 10^6

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is greater than 0, and `t` should start at 0.

State: **`t` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
