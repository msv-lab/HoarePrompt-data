### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b`, which represent the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.

2. **Logic for Determining Reachability:**
   - The robot starts at cell `(1, 1)`.
   - The robot moves every second, and it must follow the arrows in the grid.
   - The function checks if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` by examining the arrows in the grid.
   - The key logic is in the inner loop where it checks for specific conditions that would prevent the robot from reaching the target cell.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - The loop iterates over the columns in steps of 2 (i.e., `i` starts from 1 and increments by 2).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`: This condition checks if the arrow in the first row at column `i` and the arrow in the second row at column `i + 1` both point to the left. If this is true, the robot would be stuck in a loop and unable to reach the target cell.
     - `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`: This condition checks if the arrow in the first row at column `i` and the arrow in the second row at column `i - 1` both point to the left. If this is true, the robot would also be stuck in a loop and unable to reach the target cell.
   - If either of these conditions is met, the function prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If neither condition is met for any column, the function prints 'Yes'.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which is the correct format as specified in the problem description.

### Issues:
- **Case Sensitivity:** The function prints 'No' and 'Yes' with different capitalizations. The problem description states that the output can be in any case, but it's a good practice to be consistent. The function should print either all 'YES' or all 'No'.
- **Index Out of Range:** The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` can lead to an index out of range error if `i + 1` is equal to `n` (the last column). This is because `b[i + 1]` would be accessing an index that is out of bounds. The correct condition should be `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` only if `i + 1 < n`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if (i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<') or (a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'):
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            print('YES')
```

### Correctness:
- **True** if the corrected program is used.
- **False** if the original program is used due to the potential index out of range error and inconsistent capitalization.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False** (due to the potential index out of range error and inconsistent capitalization).
