### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to process the grid and print the results.

2. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - `A` and `idx_A` are initialized to store cumulative counts and indices of '>' characters.
     - `B` and `idx_B` are initialized to store cumulative counts and indices of '<' characters.
   - **First Loop (for '>' characters)**:
     - The loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right.
     - If `s[i]` is '>', it calculates the cumulative count of '>' characters up to that point, adjusted by the distance from the last '>' character and the number of '>' characters encountered so far.
     - It appends the cumulative count to `A` and the index to `idx_A`.
   - **Second Loop (for '<' characters)**:
     - The loop iterates over the string `s` from right to left.
     - If `s[i]` is '<', it calculates the cumulative count of '<' characters from the end of the string up to that point, adjusted by the distance from the last '<' character and the number of '<' characters encountered so far.
     - It appends the cumulative count to `B` and the index to `idx_B`.
   - **Third Loop (for each cell)**:
     - The loop iterates over each cell in the string `s` to determine the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
     - It uses the cumulative counts and indices stored in `A` and `B` to calculate the time.
     - The logic for calculating the time is complex and involves multiple conditions to handle different scenarios:
       - If the current character is '>', it calculates the time based on the cumulative counts and indices of '>' and '<' characters.
       - If the current character is '<', it calculates the time based on the cumulative counts and indices of '<' and '>' characters.
     - The results are printed for each cell.

3. **Complexity and Correctness**:
   - The program uses a combination of cumulative counts and indices to efficiently calculate the time for each cell.
   - The logic for handling the cumulative counts and indices is intricate but appears to be correctly implemented to handle the movement of the pinball and the inversion of characters.
   - The program ensures that the pinball will always leave the grid within a finite number of steps, as required by the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as a string with only '>' or only '<' characters.
   - It also handles the general case where the string contains a mix of '<' and '>' characters.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem as described. The logic for calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid is sound and handles all the edge cases and general scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
