### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function reads from standard input, skipping the first line which contains the number of test cases. This is appropriate as per the problem statement.
   - Each subsequent line is parsed to extract the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Logic for Tents Calculation**:
   - The function increments `b` by `c` to account for the universals who can potentially fill the tents with extroverts.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is used to calculate the number of tents. Let's break this down:
     - `-b // 3` is equivalent to `-(b // 3)`, which calculates the number of full tents needed for extroverts and universals combined.
     - `a - -(b // 3)` is then used to calculate the total number of tents. This is because `a` represents the number of introverts, each of whom needs a separate tent, and `-(b // 3)` accounts for the additional tents needed for extroverts and universals.
     - The `-` before `b // 3` is used to ensure that the division is floored correctly, which is a clever but somewhat obscure way to handle the division.

3. **Condition for Impossibility**:
   - The condition `c < b % 3` checks if there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents for extroverts.
   - If `c < b % 3`, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirement, and the function prints `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated number of tents.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `a`, `b`, and `c` are all zero by correctly printing `0`.
   - It also handles large inputs up to \(10^9\) as specified in the problem statement.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `1 2 3`, the function correctly calculates that 1 tent is needed for the introvert, and 2 tents are needed for the extroverts and universals, resulting in a total of 3 tents.
   - For the input `1 4 1`, the function correctly identifies that it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirement with only 1 universal, and prints `-1`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the problem as described, including the edge cases and the condition for impossibility. The logic is sound and the execution summary confirms that the program processes the input and produces the expected output.

**Correctness: True**
