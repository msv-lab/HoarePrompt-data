Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires us to maximize the score by performing n moves, where each move involves selecting two integers from a list of 2n integers, adding the minimum of the two to the score, and then removing both integers.
   - The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer to ensure that the minimum value added to the score is as large as possible.

2. **Approach**:
   - Sorting the list of integers is a valid approach because it ensures that the smallest elements are paired together.
   - By iterating through the sorted list and taking every second element starting from the first, we are effectively adding the minimum of each pair to the score.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n`.
   - It reads the list of 2n integers and sorts them.
   - It initializes the score to 0.
   - It iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (starting from the first element) and adding it to the score.
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

4. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case independently.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of pairs `n` and the list of 2n integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers, which is a crucial step in ensuring the optimal pairing.
   - The loop `for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2)` correctly iterates through the sorted list, taking every second element (the smallest element of each pair) and adding it to the score.
   - The score is then printed for each test case.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program's logic aligns with the optimal strategy of pairing the smallest elements together.
   - The sorting step ensures that the smallest elements are always paired first, which is necessary to maximize the score.
   - The loop correctly sums the smallest n elements from the sorted list, which are the minimum values of each pair.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` is 1 or the maximum allowed value (50) correctly.
   - It also handles cases where all elements are the same or where the elements are in a random order.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct and will produce the maximum possible score for each test case.

Final: **True**
