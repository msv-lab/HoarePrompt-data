The function `func_14` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided constraints and relationships, it is implied that the function uses two integers `n` and `k` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.

**Case_1:** The function returns the string '1\n2'.

**Case_2:** The function returns a string that consists of the length of the list `ans` followed by a newline character and then the elements of `ans` separated by spaces. If `k` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the number 2 repeated `l` times, where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing powers of 2 from \(2^0\) to \(2^{l-1}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
