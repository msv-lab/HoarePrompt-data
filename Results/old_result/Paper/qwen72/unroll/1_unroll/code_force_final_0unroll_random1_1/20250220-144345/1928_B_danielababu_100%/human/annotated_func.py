#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value entered by the user. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has returned the integer value provided by the user.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input parameters. This function is intended to read a sequence of integers from the standard input, which should be provided in a single line separated by spaces.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that converts each element in the sequence of integers read from the standard input (provided as a single line of space-separated numbers) into an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a sequence of integers from the standard input, provided as a single line of space-separated numbers, and returns a map object that converts each element in the sequence into an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any parameters and is designed to read input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer is converted from a space-separated input provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input and returns a list of integers, where each integer is converted from the input provided by the user. The function does not take any parameters and does not modify any external state. After the function concludes, the user will have a list of integers derived from their input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were input by the user, where the input was a space-separated string of numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` does not accept any parameters. It reads a space-separated string of numbers from the user, converts each number to an integer, and returns a sorted list of these integers. The function affects the program state by consuming user input and producing a sorted list of integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters. It reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a string of space-separated values that can be converted to strings.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each input value from the standard input (a string of space-separated values) into a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` reads a string of space-separated values from the standard input and returns an iterator that yields each value as a string. The function does not modify any external state or variables. After the function concludes, the caller can iterate over the returned iterator to access the string values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, as the function does not take any parameters.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters. It reads a string from the user input and returns a list containing each character of the input string. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a list of characters from the input string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used, and the function does not take any parameters.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where the strings are the input values provided by the user, split by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, splits the input into a list of strings based on spaces, sorts the list, and returns the sorted list of strings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and each integer in arr is a positive integer.
def func_8(arr):
    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):

        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` remains a list of integers, each integer in `arr` is a positive integer. `ans` is a list of integers where each element is the product of all the elements in `arr` up to that index. `tem` is the product of all the elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element is the product of all the elements in `arr` up to that index.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list `arr` of positive integers and returns a list `ans` where each element is the product of all the elements in `arr` up to that index. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_9(arr):

        ans.append(tem)
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` remains the same list of integers, `ans` is a list of products starting from the last element of `arr` to the first, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` which contains the products of all elements in `arr`, starting from the last element to the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. The list `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.
