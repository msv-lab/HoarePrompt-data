The function `func` reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It processes these inputs and determines the winner of a game based on the rules provided. The function prints the winner ('Alice' or 'Bob') for each test case to standard output. After processing all test cases, the function exits, and the output for each test case has been printed. The internal variables used within the function are no longer in scope and are undefined.
