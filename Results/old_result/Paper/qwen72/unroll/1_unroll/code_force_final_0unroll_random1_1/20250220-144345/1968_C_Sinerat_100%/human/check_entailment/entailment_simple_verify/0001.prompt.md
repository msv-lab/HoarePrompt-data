You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        a[0] = 1000
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        print(*a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take two parameters: a list `x` of integers where `1 <= x_i <= 500` and an integer `n` where `2 <= n <= 500`, and `len(x) == n - 1`. Additionally, the function should handle multiple test cases, indicated by an integer `t` where `1 <= t <= 10^4`.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a = [0] * n
        
        a[0] = 1000
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]
        
        print(*a)
        
    #State: For each test case, the output state is a list `a` of length `n` where the first element is 1000, and each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in `a` and the corresponding element in `x`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization of `a[0]`:**
   - The program initializes `a[0]` to 1000. This is a valid choice because \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).

2. **Construction of `a` array:**
   - The program constructs the array `a` such that for each \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), \(a[i] = a[i-1] + x[i-1]\).
   - This ensures that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) because \(a_i\) is exactly \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), and the remainder when \(a_i\) is divided by \(a_{i-1}\) is \(x_{i-1}\).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The program ensures that \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\) for all \(1 \le i \le n\).
   - Since \(a[0] = 1000\) and each subsequent \(a[i]\) is constructed by adding \(x[i-1]\) (which is at most 500), the values of \(a[i]\) will not exceed \(10^9\).

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed array `a` for each test case.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: \(n = 4\), \(x = [2, 4, 1]\)
  - Output: \(a = [1000, 1002, 1006, 1007]\)
  - Verification:
    - \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 = x_2\)
    - \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 = x_3\)
    - \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1007 \bmod 1006 = 1 = x_4\)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: \(n = 3\), \(x = [1, 1]\)
  - Output: \(a = [1000, 1001, 1002]\)
  - Verification:
    - \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1001 \bmod 1000 = 1 = x_2\)
    - \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1002 \bmod 1001 = 1 = x_3\)

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: \(n = 6\), \(x = [4, 2, 5, 1, 2]\)
  - Output: \(a = [1000, 1004, 1006, 1011, 1012, 1014]\)
  - Verification:
    - \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1004 \bmod 1000 = 4 = x_2\)
    - \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1006 \bmod 1004 = 2 = x_3\)
    - \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1011 \bmod 1006 = 5 = x_4\)
    - \(a_5 \bmod a_4 = 1012 \bmod 1011 = 1 = x_5\)
    - \(a_6 \bmod a_5 = 1014 \bmod 1012 = 2 = x_6\)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: \(n = 2\), \(x = [500]\)
  - Output: \(a = [1000, 1500]\)
  - Verification:
    - \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1500 \bmod 1000 = 500 = x_2\)

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Input: \(n = 3\), \(x = [1, 5]\)
  - Output: \(a = [1000, 1001, 1006]\)
  - Verification:
    - \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1001 \bmod 1000 = 1 = x_2\)
    - \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 1006 \bmod 1001 = 5 = x_3\)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the array `a` such that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\) for all \(2 \le i \le n\). The values of `a` are within the specified range \(1 \le a_i \le 10^9\). Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
