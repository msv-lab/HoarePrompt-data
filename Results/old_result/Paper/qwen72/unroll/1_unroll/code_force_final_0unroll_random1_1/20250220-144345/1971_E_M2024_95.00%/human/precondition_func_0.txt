t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5. The lists a and b are strictly increasing sequences of integers, with a_i and b_i such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i, and a_k = n. Each query d is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ n. The sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
