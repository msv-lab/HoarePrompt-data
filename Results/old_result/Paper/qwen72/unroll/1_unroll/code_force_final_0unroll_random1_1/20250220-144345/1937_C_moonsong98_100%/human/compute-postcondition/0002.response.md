Output State: **`n` is 2, `func_2(0, 1)` has been called.**

The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer with a value of 2. The code snippet calls the function `func_2` with arguments 0 and 1. Since the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine its output or any changes it might make to the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that `func_2(0, 1)` has been called.
