Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24, provided by user input. The input is a list of n strings, each of length n, where each string represents a row in the transition video plan. The characters in these strings are either 'F' for funny, 'S' for scary, '?' for undecided, or '.' for the diagonal. The matrix is symmetric, and at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided, meaning at most 2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be 'F' or 'S'.**
