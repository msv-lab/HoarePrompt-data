Output State: **`a` is a list of positive integers representing the health of each monster, `x` is a list of non-zero integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of bullets you can fire each second, `n` is the number of monsters (equal to the length of `a` and `x`), `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from 0 to n-1, sorted by the absolute values of the elements in `x`, `distance` is 0.**

The variable `distance` is initialized to 0, and the states of the other variables (`a`, `x`, `k`, `n`, `sorted_indices`) remain unchanged.
