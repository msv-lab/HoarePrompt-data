The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. Since there are no input parameters and no specific output conditions provided, it is not possible to determine a specific return value or behavior from the given information alone. However, based on the typical behavior of functions, it can be inferred that the function might return a value or perform an action, but without more details, the exact functionality cannot be precisely described.
