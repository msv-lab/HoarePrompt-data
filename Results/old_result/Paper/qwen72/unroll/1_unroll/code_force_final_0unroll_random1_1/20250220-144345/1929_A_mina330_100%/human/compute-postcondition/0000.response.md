The code snippet `ntest = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to the variable `ntest`. The value of `ntest` will be an integer between 1 and 500, as specified in the initial state. The list of lists and the elements within those lists remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ntest` is an integer between 1 and 500, the function should accept two parameters: t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the elements of the array a.**
