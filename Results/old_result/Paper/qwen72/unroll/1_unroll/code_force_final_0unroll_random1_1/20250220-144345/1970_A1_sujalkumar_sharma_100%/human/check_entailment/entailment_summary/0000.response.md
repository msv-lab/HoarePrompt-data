Reasoning:  
The provided Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program iterates through the input string `s` and calculates the balance for each prefix. This is done by maintaining a running balance that increases by 1 for each opening parenthesis "(" and decreases by 1 for each closing parenthesis ")". The balance and position of each character are stored in a list `prefix_balance`.

2. **Sorting**: The list `prefix_balance` is then sorted based on the balance value in ascending order. For characters with the same balance value, the positions are sorted in descending order. This ensures that the characters are rearranged according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

3. **Result Construction**: After sorting, the characters are extracted from the sorted list and concatenated to form the result string. This is done using a list comprehension and the `join` method.

4. **Output**: The function `func_1` returns the result string, which is then printed by the main part of the program.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes the input string correctly and returns the expected output. The example provided in the problem description is also correctly handled by the program.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
