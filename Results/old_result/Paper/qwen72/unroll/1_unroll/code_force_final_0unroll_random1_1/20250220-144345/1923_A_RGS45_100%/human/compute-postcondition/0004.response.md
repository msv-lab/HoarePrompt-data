Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input from the user to process a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string of `n` characters (each character is either '0' or '1'). The function finds the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string and prints the number of '0's between these two occurrences. If a test case does not contain a '1', the function will print 0. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but it prints the results for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated and used during the execution of the function. **
