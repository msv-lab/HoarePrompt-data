You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it prints the maximum number of elements in the list `s` that can be made non-decreasing by swapping the first element with the k-th element or by swapping the first element with the k-th element and then swapping the element at position `p` with the k-th element. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and an integer `k`, followed by a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. The function then determines and prints the maximum number of elements in the list `s` that can be made non-decreasing by performing one or two specific swaps: either swapping the first element with the `k`-th element, or swapping the first element with the `k`-th element and then swapping the element at position `p` (determined during the process) with the `k`-th element. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `s` remain unchanged after the function concludes.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of your cow `k`.
   - It then reads the list of Cowdeforces ratings `s`.

2. **First Swap and Initial Win Count:**
   - The program swaps the position of your cow with the first cow (`s[0]` and `s[k-1]`).
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of wins for your cow.
   - It sets `h` to the rating of your cow in the new position.
   - It iterates through the list starting from the second cow (`s[1:]`).
   - For each cow, it checks if your cow's rating `h` is greater than the current cow's rating. If it is, your cow wins and `ans` is incremented. If it is not, the loop breaks.
   - It calculates the position `p` where your cow loses.

3. **Second Swap and Optimized Win Count:**
   - The program swaps the positions back to the original order.
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0, which will count the number of wins for your cow in the second scenario.
   - It swaps your cow's position with the position `p` where it lost in the first scenario.
   - It initializes `z` to 0, which is a flag to indicate if your cow has already been encountered in the list.
   - It iterates through the list again, checking for wins and losses.
   - If the current cow's rating is equal to `h` and it is not the first cow, it increments `ans1`.
   - If the current cow's rating is greater than `h`, the loop breaks.
   - If the current cow's rating is less than `h` and the flag `z` is set, it increments `ans1`.

4. **Output the Maximum Wins:**
   - The program prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`, which represents the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the swapping and win counting for two scenarios: one where the cow is swapped to the first position and another where it is swapped to the position where it would lose in the first scenario.
- The logic for counting wins is correct, but the second swap logic is a bit convoluted and could be simplified.

### Simplified Logic:
- The first part of the program correctly counts the wins if your cow is swapped to the first position.
- The second part should count the wins if your cow is swapped to the position where it would lose in the first scenario. However, the current implementation is not straightforward and could be simplified.

### Correctness:
- The program is logically correct in terms of the problem description.
- It correctly handles the two scenarios and outputs the maximum number of wins.
- However, the second part of the win counting logic is a bit complex and could be simplified for better readability and maintainability.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and will produce the expected output for the given problem description. However, the second part of the win counting logic could be simplified for better clarity.
