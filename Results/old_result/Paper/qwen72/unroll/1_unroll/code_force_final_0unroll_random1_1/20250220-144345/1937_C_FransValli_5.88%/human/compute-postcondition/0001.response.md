Output State: **The function has completed all iterations of the loop and has output a pair of indices (k, best) for each test case, such that the bitwise XOR of the elements at these indices in the permutation is maximized. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, while `k` and `best` have been updated to the indices that maximize the XOR for each test case.**
