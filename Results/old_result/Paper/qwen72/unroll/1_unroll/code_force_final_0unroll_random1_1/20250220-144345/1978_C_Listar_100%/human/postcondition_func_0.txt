The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and `k` is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 1,000,000,000,000) that is divisible by 2. The function returns a list `l` which initially contains integers from 1 to `n`. The function modifies `l` and `k` through a series of operations. If `k` becomes 0, the function returns the current state of `l`. If `k` is less than the current value of `i - 1` during the loop, the function returns the result of `func_2(c, k, l)`. Otherwise, it continues to modify `l` and `k` until the loop completes, at which point it returns the final state of `l`.
