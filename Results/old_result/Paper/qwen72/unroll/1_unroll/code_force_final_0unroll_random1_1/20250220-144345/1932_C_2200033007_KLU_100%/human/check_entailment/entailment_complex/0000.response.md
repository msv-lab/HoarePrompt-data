Reasoning:

The program is designed to process a series of commands ('L' or 'R') on an array `a` and output the remainder of the product of the array's elements modulo `m` at each step, as described in the problem statement. However, there are a few issues with the implementation that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Handling of the Product and Remainder**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to output the remainder of the product of the current state of the array `a` modulo `m` at each step.
   - Instead, the function `func_1` constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands in `s`, but it does not compute the product of the current state of `a` at each step. Instead, it computes the cumulative product of the elements in `b` in reverse order, which is not the same as the product of the current state of `a`.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach would be to maintain the product of the current state of `a` and update it by removing the appropriate element (either the leftmost or rightmost) based on the command in `s`.
   - The product should be updated and the remainder taken at each step, and the result should be appended to the list `ans`.

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - The current implementation constructs `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands, but it does not correctly reflect the product of the current state of `a`.
   - The final product computation in `ans` is done on the rearranged list `b` in reverse order, which does not match the problem requirements.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case in the example:
     - Initial array `a` is `[3, 1, 4, 2]`.
     - Commands `s` are `LRRL`.
     - The correct output should be `0 2 4 1`, which represents the remainder of the product of the current state of `a` at each step.
     - The current implementation will produce a different output because it does not correctly compute the product of the current state of `a`.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
