### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - The problem requires counting the number of different permutations of length \( n \) that could have been guessed based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The key constraints are that the first element of the prefix maximums must be 1, the last element of the prefix maximums must be the same as the first element of the suffix maximums, and the last element of the suffix maximums must be \( n \).

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Precomputation of Factorials:**
     - The code precomputes factorials modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and stores them in the `facts` list. This is a common technique for efficiently computing combinations and permutations in modular arithmetic.
   - **Input Handling:**
     - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - **Initial Validity Check:**
     - The code checks if the last element of the prefix maximums is the same as the first element of the suffix maximums, the first element of the prefix maximums is 1, and the last element of the suffix maximums is \( n \). If any of these conditions fail, the program prints 0, which is correct because no valid permutation can satisfy the given conditions.
   - **Combination Calculation:**
     - The code uses a combination of the precomputed factorials and the `func_2` function to calculate the number of valid permutations. The `func_2` function is used to compute the modular inverse of a factorial, which is necessary for calculating combinations modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - **Processing Suffix Maximums:**
     - The code iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between each pair of suffix maximums.
   - **Processing Prefix Maximums:**
     - The code reverses the prefix maximums (excluding the first and last elements) and calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between each pair of prefix maximums.
   - **Final Multiplication:**
     - The code multiplies the results of the combination calculations with the factorials of the gaps between the maximums to get the final answer.

3. **Function `func_1` and `func_2`:**
   - **`func_1`**:
     - This function is indeed related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the modular inverse. The function returns a pair of integers \((c, d)\) such that \( c \cdot a + d \cdot b = \gcd(a, b) \). When \( b = 1000000007 \), it effectively finds the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 1000000007 \).
   - **`func_2`**:
     - This function uses `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of a factorial and then multiplies it by another integer \( a \) modulo \( 1000000007 \). This is used to compute combinations efficiently.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly checks the initial conditions for the validity of the permutation.
   - The combination and permutation calculations are performed correctly using the precomputed factorials and modular inverses.
   - The final answer is computed by multiplying the results of the combination calculations with the factorials of the gaps between the maximums, which is a valid approach for counting permutations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The provided code does correctly address the problem of counting the number of different permutations based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find modular inverses is a valid and necessary step in the computation of combinations and permutations in modular arithmetic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
