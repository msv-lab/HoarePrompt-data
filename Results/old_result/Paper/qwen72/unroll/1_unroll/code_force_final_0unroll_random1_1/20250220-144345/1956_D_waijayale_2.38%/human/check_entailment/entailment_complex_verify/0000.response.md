### Reasoning:

1. **Original Assessment Validity**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies a significant issue in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function. The function `func_2` calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` without passing the `ops` list, which is required by `func_1`. This will indeed result in a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
   - The condition `if a[l] != r - l + 1` in `func_1` is not always correct. The MEX operation should be applied to the range `[l, r]` to find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set, but the code directly sets `a[l]` to `r - l + 1` without computing the MEX. This is a logical error that can lead to incorrect results.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
     - The function correctly handles the base case where `l == r`. If `a[l]` is not 0, it appends the operation `(l, l)` to `ops` and sets `a[l]` to 0.
     - The recursive call `func_1(a, l + 1, r, ops)` is correct.
     - The condition `if a[l] != r - l + 1` is incorrect because it should compute the MEX of the range `[l, r]` and set all elements in this range to the MEX value, not `r - l + 1`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
     - The function correctly initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`, but it does not pass `ops` to `recursive_maximize_sum`, which is a critical error.
     - The function returns the sum of the modified array `a`, the number of operations, and the list of operations.
   - **Function 3 (`recursive_maximize_sum`)**:
     - The function correctly computes the sum of the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` and checks if it is less than or equal to the square of the range length.
     - If the condition is met, it calls `func_1` to modify the subarray and appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops`.
     - If the condition is not met, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively processes the subranges to the left and right of the maximum value.
   - **Function 4 (`func_3`)**:
     - The function correctly reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.
     - The loop iterates through each pair `(l, r)` in `ops` and prints `l + 1` and `r + 1` for each pair.

3. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - **Input**:
     ```
     4
     1 2 3 0
     ```
   - **Expected Output**:
     ```
     10 1
     1 4
     ```
   - **Actual Output**:
     - The program will raise a `NameError` because `ops` is not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.
     - Even if `ops` were defined, the MEX computation is incorrect, leading to the wrong modification of the array `a`.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program has significant logical and scope issues that prevent it from working correctly.
- The program will raise a `NameError` due to the missing `ops` parameter in the `recursive_maximize_sum` function call.
- The MEX computation is not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect modifications of the array `a`.

Final: **False**
