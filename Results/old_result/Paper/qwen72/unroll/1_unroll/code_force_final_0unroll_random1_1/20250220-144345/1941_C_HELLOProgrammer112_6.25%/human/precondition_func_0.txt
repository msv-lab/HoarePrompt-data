The function `func` is expected to take input parameters, but the function definition provided does not include any parameters. The correct function definition should include parameters `t` for the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` for the length of the string `s`. The string `s` should consist of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` should be an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6. The total sum of `n` across all test cases should not exceed 10^6.
