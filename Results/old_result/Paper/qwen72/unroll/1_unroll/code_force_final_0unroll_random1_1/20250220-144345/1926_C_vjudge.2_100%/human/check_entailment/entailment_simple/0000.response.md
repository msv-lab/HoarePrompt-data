### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the largest number Vladislav writes.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes a list `pd` of length `200001` (which is `N` in the code) with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to `N-1` (i.e., 1 to 200000) and for each integer `i`, it:
     - Adds the value of `pd[i-1]` to `pd[i]` to maintain a cumulative sum.
     - Converts the integer `i` to a string and iterates over each character, converting it back to an integer and adding it to `pd[i]`.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the integer `n` and prints the value of `pd[n]`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The precomputation step correctly calculates the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i` and stores the cumulative sum in `pd[i]`.
   - The query handling step correctly retrieves the precomputed sum for each `n` and prints it.

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The precomputation step runs in O(N * log(N)) time, where N is 200000. This is efficient enough given the constraints.
   - The query handling step runs in O(t) time, where t is the number of test cases. This is also efficient given the constraints.

6. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n = 12`, the sum of the digits from 1 to 12 is 51, which matches the expected output.
   - For `n = 1`, the sum of the digits from 1 to 1 is 1, which matches the expected output.
   - For `n = 2`, the sum of the digits from 1 to 2 is 3, which matches the expected output.
   - For `n = 3`, the sum of the digits from 1 to 3 is 6, which matches the expected output.
   - For `n = 1434`, the sum of the digits from 1 to 1434 is 18465, which matches the expected output.
   - For `n = 2024`, the sum of the digits from 1 to 2024 is 28170, which matches the expected output.
   - For `n = 200000`, the sum of the digits from 1 to 200000 is 4600002, which matches the expected output.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly computes the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` for each test case and prints the results efficiently within the given constraints.
