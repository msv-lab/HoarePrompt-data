You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func` processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of sides of a polygon `n`, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen `x`, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose `y`, and a list of `x` distinct vertices chosen by Bessie. It then calculates the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen, including Bessie's chosen vertices and additional vertices, to form triangles within the polygon, given the constraints. The function prints the result for each test case. The state of the program after the function concludes is that the input variables `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices` are re-assigned for each test case, and the final value of `ans` for each test case represents the maximum number of vertices that can be chosen to form triangles.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Initial Setup:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` which represent the number of sides of the polygon, the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose.
   - It reads the list of vertices `a` that Bessie has chosen and converts them to 0-based indices for easier manipulation.

2. **Initial Answer Calculation:**
   - The initial number of triangles `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because any set of `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles by connecting them with diagonals. This is a correct starting point.

3. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The function checks for additional triangles that can be formed by adding one or two vertices to the existing vertices.
   - For each vertex `a[i]`, it checks if the next vertex `t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n` and the vertex after that `t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n` are not already in the set of chosen vertices `st`.
   - If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, it increments `ans` by 1. This is because adding `t1` would form a new triangle with `a[i]` and `t2`.

4. **Gap Analysis:**
   - The function then calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - It separates these gaps into odd and even lists.
   - The gaps are sorted to handle the smallest gaps first, which is a good strategy to maximize the number of triangles.

5. **Handling Odd Gaps:**
   - For each odd gap, the function checks if the remaining `y` vertices are sufficient to add the gap.
   - If `y` is less than half of the gap, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and sets `y` to 0.
   - Otherwise, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by half of the gap.

6. **Handling Even Gaps:**
   - For each even gap, the function follows a similar logic as for odd gaps.
   - It checks if the remaining `y` vertices are sufficient to add the gap.
   - If `y` is less than half of the gap, it adds `2 * y` to `ans` and sets `y` to 0.
   - Otherwise, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and decreases `y` by half of the gap.

7. **Output:**
   - Finally, the function prints the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake for each test case.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The initial setup and the initial answer calculation are correct.
- The additional triangle check for vertices `t1` and `t2` is also correct.
- The gap analysis and handling of odd and even gaps are designed to maximize the number of triangles by adding the smallest possible gaps first, which is a valid approach.
- The logic for handling the remaining `y` vertices is also correct, ensuring that the maximum number of triangles is formed without exceeding the limit on additional vertices.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
