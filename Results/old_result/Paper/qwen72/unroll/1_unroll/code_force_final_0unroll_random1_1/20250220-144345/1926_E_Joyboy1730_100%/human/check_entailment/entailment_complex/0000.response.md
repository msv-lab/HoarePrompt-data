### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Card Laying Process:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `L` to keep track of the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - It uses a while loop to determine how many cards are laid down in each step. The variable `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards (or cards that are multiples of an odd number) in the current step.
   - The variable `n` is then updated by subtracting `m`, and `m` is appended to the list `L`.

3. **Finding the k-th Card:**
   - The function initializes `tot` to 0, which keeps track of the cumulative number of cards laid down.
   - It also initializes `pow` to 1, which represents the current multiplier (1 for odd numbers, 2 for twice an odd number, 3 for three times an odd number, etc.).
   - The function then iterates over the list `L` to find the step in which the k-th card is laid down.
   - If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, it means the k-th card is in the current step, and the function prints the card number calculated as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - The variable `tot` is updated by adding `a`, and `pow` is doubled for the next step.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 1, as it will only lay down the card 1.
   - For larger values of `n`, the function correctly processes the cards in the required order and finds the k-th card.

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the correct k-th card for each test case, as verified by the example provided.
