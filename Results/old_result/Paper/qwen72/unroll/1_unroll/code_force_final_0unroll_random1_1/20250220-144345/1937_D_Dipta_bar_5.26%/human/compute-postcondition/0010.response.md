Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `B` is a list of integers representing the cumulative count of '<' characters multiplied by their respective positions since the last '>' character in reverse order, `idx_B` is a list of indices where each '<' character is located in the string `s` in reverse order, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`.** 

The variable `r` is assigned the value of the length of the list `B`. The other variables (`A`, `B`, `idx_B`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
