### Reasoning

Let's break down the program and the problem to evaluate the correctness.

#### Problem Breakdown
1. **Permutation and Maximums**: We are given a permutation of length \( n \) and the indices of its prefix and suffix maximums. We need to count the number of different permutations that could have been guessed.
2. **Prefix and Suffix Maximums**:
   - A prefix maximum \( a_i \) is the maximum element in the subarray \( a[1 \ldots i] \).
   - A suffix maximum \( a_i \) is the maximum element in the subarray \( a[i \ldots n] \).
3. **Constraints**:
   - \( 1 \le t \le 10^4 \)
   - \( 1 \le m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 \)
   - The sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

#### Program Analysis
1. **Precompute Factorials**:
   - The program precomputes factorials modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) and stores them in the list `facts`.
   - This is useful for calculating combinations and permutations efficiently.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m_1 \), and \( m_2 \), and the lists of prefix and suffix maximum indices \( p \) and \( s \).

3. **Initial Checks**:
   - The program checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is \( n \).
   - If any of these conditions fail, the program prints 0, indicating no valid permutation exists.

4. **Calculate Combinations**:
   - The program uses the function `func_2` to calculate combinations and permutations.
   - `func_2(a, b)` is used to compute \( a \times b^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7 \), where \( b^{-1} \) is the modular inverse of \( b \).

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` is a helper function that computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the coefficients of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - However, it is used in `func_2` to find the modular inverse of \( b \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

6. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the suffix maximums and prefix maximums.
   - It uses the precomputed factorials to calculate the combinations and permutations.

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - The program multiplies the results of the combinations and permutations to get the final answer.
   - The answer is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.

#### Annotations and State Analysis
- **Precompute Factorials**:
  - The loop precomputes factorials and stores them in `facts`.
  - This is correct and necessary for efficient combination calculations.

- **Initial Checks**:
  - The checks ensure that the first and last elements of the prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with the permutation properties.
  - This is a valid and necessary step to filter out invalid test cases.

- **Combination Calculation**:
  - The program uses `func_2` to calculate the modular inverse of the denominator in the combination formula.
  - The combination formula is used to count the number of ways to arrange elements between the maximums.
  - This is a correct approach to solve the problem.

- **Final Calculation**:
  - The program multiplies the results of the combinations and permutations to get the final answer.
  - The answer is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers.
  - This is a correct approach to solve the problem.

#### Original Assessment
The original assessment states that the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem. However, this is incorrect. The functions are used to compute combinations and permutations, which are essential for solving the problem. The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is used to find the modular inverse, which is necessary for the combination calculations.

### Final Evaluation
The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of different permutations based on the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The use of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular inverse is a valid and necessary part of the solution. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
