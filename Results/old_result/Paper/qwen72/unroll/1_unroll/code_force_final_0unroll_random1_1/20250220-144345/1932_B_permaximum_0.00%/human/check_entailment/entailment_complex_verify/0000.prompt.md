You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should accept two parameters: a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs, and an integer `n` representing the number of signs. The list `a` should have a length of `n` and each element `a_i` should satisfy 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Additionally, the function should be able to handle multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        
        print(year)
        
    #State: The variable `year` will be the sum of the smallest non-zero multiples of each element in the list `a` for each test case, and the result will be printed for each test case. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` will retain their values as they were at the end of the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. It calculates the smallest non-zero multiple of each element in `a` and sums these values to produce a result `year`. The function prints `year` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variables `t`, `n`, and `a` retain their values from the last iteration, and the function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the sequential occurrence of signs as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the line `year += year % ai or ai` does not ensure that the signs occur strictly after the previous sign. For example, if the input is `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`, the program will calculate the year as follows:

1. For `a1 = 3`, `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
2. For `a2 = 2`, `year = 3 + 0 = 3` (since `3 % 2 == 1` and `1 or 2` evaluates to `1`, but the correct year should be `4`).
3. For `a3 = 4`, `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `4 % 4 == 0` and `0 or 4` evaluates to `4`, but the correct year should be `8`).
4. For `a4 = 5`, `year = 4 + 1 = 5` (since `5 % 5 == 0` and `0 or 5` evaluates to `5`, but the correct year should be `10`).
5. For `a5 = 9`, `year = 5 + 4 = 9` (since `9 % 9 == 0` and `0 or 9` evaluates to `9`, but the correct year should be `18`).
6. For `a6 = 18`, `year = 9 + 9 = 18` (since `18 % 18 == 0` and `0 or 18` evaluates to `18`, but the correct year should be `36`).

The program fails to correctly compute the year for the second and subsequent signs, as it does not account for the requirement that the signs must occur strictly after the previous sign. The correct approach would involve finding the next multiple of `ai` that is greater than the current year.
