Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Modification of Elements:**
   - In `func_2`, the while loop modifies `list[i - 1]`, `list[i]`, and `list[i + 1]` based on the value of `list[i - 1]`. This is incorrect because the operation should subtract 1 from `list[i - 1]`, 2 from `list[i]`, and 1 from `list[i + 1]` in each step, not based on the value of `list[i - 1]`.

2. **Infinite Loop Potential:**
   - The while loop condition `while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0)` can lead to an infinite loop if the values are not properly decremented. The current implementation does not correctly handle the decrementing of elements.

3. **Incorrect Check for Zero Elements:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero, but it is called after the potentially incorrect modifications in `func_2`.

4. **Logical Error in Operation Application:**
   - The operation should be applied to indices `i` where `2 <= i <= n-1`, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the indices and the conditions for applying the operation.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to understand that the operation can only be applied to elements where `a_i >= 2` and both `a_{i-1}` and `a_{i+1}` are greater than 0. We should also check if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4, as each operation reduces the sum by 4. If the sum is not divisible by 4, it is impossible to make all elements zero.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def can_make_zero(arr, n):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    if total_sum % 4 != 0:
        return False
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while arr[i] >= 2 and arr[i - 1] > 0 and arr[i + 1] > 0:
            arr[i - 1] -= 1
            arr[i] -= 2
            arr[i + 1] -= 1
    
    return all(x == 0 for x in arr)

def solve(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for n, arr in test_cases:
        if can_make_zero(arr, n):
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results

# Example usage:
t = 7
test_cases = [
    (5, [1, 3, 5, 5, 2]),
    (5, [2, 4, 4, 5, 1]),
    (5, [0, 1, 3, 3, 1]),
    (6, [5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]),
    (4, [1, 2, 7, 2]),
    (3, [7, 1, 0]),
    (4, [1, 1, 1, 1])
]

results = solve(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Sum Check:**
   - The function `can_make_zero` first checks if the total sum of the array is divisible by 4. If not, it returns `False`.

2. **Operation Application:**
   - The function then iterates through the array and applies the operation to indices `i` where `2 <= i <= n-1` and the conditions `arr[i] >= 2`, `arr[i - 1] > 0`, and `arr[i + 1] > 0` are met.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After applying the operations, the function checks if all elements in the array are zero using a list comprehension.

4. **Test Case Handling:**
   - The `solve` function handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

This corrected approach ensures that the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operations.
