### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over the list `cas_de_test`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the number of test cases `t` and the list of test cases `cas_de_test`.

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the total points `total_points` is even. This is correct because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) contributes an even number of points (2 points for a win/loss and 2 points for a draw).
   - If `total_points` is odd, the program appends `-1` to the results, which is correct because it's impossible to have an odd total points with the given scoring system.

3. **Total Matches Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches `total_matchs` as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total score.

4. **Feasibility Check**:
   - The program checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is incorrect. The number of matches can be more than 3, and `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` because `p3` can be the result of multiple draws and wins.
   - The correct check should be to ensure that the total number of matches is non-negative and that the scores are consistent with the possible outcomes of the games.

5. **Draws Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws `egalites` as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This is incorrect because it does not correctly account for the possible number of draws.
   - The correct approach is to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent. The maximum number of draws can be calculated by minimizing the number of wins/losses.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to calculate the maximum number of draws by ensuring that the total points are even and that the scores are consistent with the possible outcomes of the games.
   - The maximum number of draws can be calculated as `total_points // 2 - (p3 - p2 + p2 - p1) // 2`.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call**:
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
  - `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers \(p_1, p_2, p_3\) such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).

- **State Inside the Function**:
  - For each tuple \((p1, p2, p3)\) in `cas_de_test`:
    - `total_points` is calculated as \(p1 + p2 + p3\).
    - If `total_points` is odd, `-1` is appended to `resultats` and the loop continues to the next tuple.
    - `total_matchs` is calculated as `total_points // 2`.
    - If `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`, `-1` is appended to `resultats` and the loop continues to the next tuple.
    - `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`.
    - If `egalites` is negative, `-1` is appended to `resultats`.
    - Otherwise, `egalites // 2` is appended to `resultats`.

- **State After Function Call**:
  - `resultats` is a list of integers, each either `-1` or the number of ties (egalites) calculated for each tuple in `cas_de_test` based on the loop's conditions.
  - The program prints the results, each on a new line.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identified the issues with the feasibility check and the draws calculation. The program's logic for determining the maximum number of draws is flawed, and the corrected approach provided in the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed feasibility check and draws calculation. The corrected program provided in the original assessment should be used instead.
