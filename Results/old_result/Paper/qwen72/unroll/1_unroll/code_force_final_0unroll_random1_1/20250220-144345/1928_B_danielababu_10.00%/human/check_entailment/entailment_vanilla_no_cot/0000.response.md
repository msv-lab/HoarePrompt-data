Correctness: **False**

The given program does not solve the problem as described. The functions provided are not related to the logic needed to solve the problem. The problem requires determining the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array. The functions provided are for reading input, sorting, and calculating cumulative products, which are not directly applicable to the problem's solution. A correct solution would involve analyzing the frequency of elements and their potential to become equal after adding a permutation.
