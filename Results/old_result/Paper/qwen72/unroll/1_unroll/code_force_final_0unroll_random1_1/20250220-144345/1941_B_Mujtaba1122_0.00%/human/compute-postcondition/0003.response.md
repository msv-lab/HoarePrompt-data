The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The precondition states that `list[0]` to `list[n-2]` are 0, and `list[n-1]` and beyond are unchanged. Additionally, the function `func_1` evaluated on `list` and `n` returns `True`.

Given that `func_1` returns `True`, the `print` statement will execute and print the string 'YES'. The precondition does not provide any additional information that affects the output of the `print` statement.

Output: **YES**
