The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop will execute. The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
- `b_1, b_2, ..., b_n` are integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9.
- The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
- `x` is an input integer.
- `custos` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop executes, `x` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` is not explicitly initialized in the state, but it will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

State: **`x` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
