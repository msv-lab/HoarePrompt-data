Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly decode the string as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for replacing characters in the string `s` is flawed. The function `func_1` attempts to replace characters in `s` with characters from the `unique_chars` list, but it does not correctly handle the symmetric replacement required by the problem.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
10
serofedsoc
```

**Expected Output:**
```
codeforces
```

**Actual Output:**
```
scrrrerrrs
```

The issue arises because the program replaces all occurrences of a character in `s` with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` in a single step, without considering the position of the character in the string. This leads to incorrect replacements and the final output does not match the expected decoded string.

To fix this, the program should create a mapping of characters in `s` to their symmetric counterparts in `unique_chars` and then apply this mapping to each character in `s` to produce the decoded string.
