### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the `n` lines of input, storing them in the list `xx`.
   - It initializes two lists `a` and `b` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario, respectively.

2. **Counting Existing Transitions**:
   - The program iterates through each row of the input matrix and updates the counts in `a` and `b` for each 'F' or 'S' character.
   - This step is correctly implemented and ensures that the counts of existing transitions are accurate.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Only One Type of Transition**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - It correctly identifies and appends scenarios to `sa` and `sb` based on the counts in `a` and `b`.

4. **Assigning Undecided Transitions**:
   - The program's logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is flawed. It only considers the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` and assigns the opposite type to the rest.
   - This approach does not ensure that the resulting transition plan will satisfy the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.
   - For example, if `n = 12`, the program might assign 'F' to the first 3 scenarios in `sa` and 'S' to the rest, which could lead to a sequence of 9 consecutive 'S' transitions, violating the constraint.

5. **Outputting the Full Transition Plan**:
   - The program constructs the full transition plan by iterating through each row of the input matrix and replacing '?' characters with 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions determined in the previous step.
   - The output is correctly formatted and maintains the symmetry of the transition matrix.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Symmetry and Consistency**:
  - The program ensures that the transition matrix remains symmetric, which is a necessary condition for the problem.

- **Handling Undecided Transitions**:
  - The program's current logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is not sufficient to guarantee that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type is met for all possible permutations of scenarios.
  - The approach of assigning 'F' or 'S' based on the first `n // 4` scenarios in `sa` or `sb` is too simplistic and does not consider the global constraint.

- **Constraint Satisfaction**:
  - The program does not explicitly check if the resulting transition plan satisfies the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type for any permutation of scenarios.
  - This is a critical requirement, and the program's current logic does not ensure it is met.

### Conclusion:
The program's logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions is not robust enough to ensure that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type is satisfied for all possible permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
