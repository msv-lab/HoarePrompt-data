Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500, `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples, each containing three integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 such that 0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30, `resultats` is a list containing the results of the loop for each tuple in `cas_de_test`. Each element in `resultats` is either -1 or an integer representing the number of ties (egalites) calculated for the corresponding tuple in `cas_de_test`.
