Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the logic for counting the number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted one. The program increments the `count` for every change in character, which is not the correct approach. Instead, the minimum number of pieces required should be determined by the number of times a '1' appears before a '0' in the string, plus one (to account for the initial piece).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        for j in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[j] == '1' and s[j + 1] == '0':
                count += 1
        print(count)
```

This version correctly counts the number of times a '1' is immediately followed by a '0', which indicates where a cut is necessary to ensure that the resulting pieces can be rearranged into a sorted binary string. The `count` is initialized to 1 to account for the initial piece before any cuts are made.
