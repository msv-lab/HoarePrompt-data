To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the objects and variables in the loop head, which are `num` and `a`.

1. **Variable `num`**: This variable will be assigned the elements of the list `a` during each iteration of the loop. Before the loop starts, `num` does not need to be explicitly set because it will be assigned the first element of `a` when the loop begins.

2. **List `a`**: The loop will iterate over the elements of `a`. For the loop to execute at least once, `a` must contain at least one element. Given the state before the loop, `a` is a list of `n` integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5`, which means `a` is guaranteed to have at least one element.

3. **Other Variables**: The variables `res` and `count` are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `a` has at least one element, and `num` will be assigned the first element of `a` when the loop begins.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j < 2^31, `res` is 0, `count` is an empty dictionary, `num` is the first element of `a`**
