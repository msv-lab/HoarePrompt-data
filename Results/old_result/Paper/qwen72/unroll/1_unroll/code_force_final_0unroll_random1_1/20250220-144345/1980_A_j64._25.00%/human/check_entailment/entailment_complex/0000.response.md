Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to hold `m` rounds, where each round requires one problem of each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G'. The program processes multiple test cases and for each test case, it calculates the number of missing problems required to meet the criteria.

### Key Points:
1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `m`, and `a`).
   - The input constraints are respected: `1 <= t <= 1000`, `1 <= n <= 50`, `1 <= m <= 5`, and `a` is a string of length `n` with characters from 'A' to 'G'.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a frequency list `freq` of length 7 (to account for 'A' to 'G') with zeros.
   - It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` for each character. This correctly counts the occurrences of each difficulty level.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the expression `max(0, m - f)`, where `f` is the frequency of a particular difficulty level.
   - The sum of these values gives the total number of missing problems needed to ensure each difficulty level appears at least `m` times.

4. **Output**:
   - The function appends the total number of missing problems to the `results` list for each test case.
   - Finally, it returns the `results` list, which contains the correct output for each test case.

### Verification:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G')
  - Missing: `sum(max(0, 1 - f) for f in freq) = 2` (missing 'A' and 'G')
  - Output: `2` (correct)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G')
  - Missing: `sum(max(0, 2 - f) for f in freq) = 5` (missing 2 'A', 1 'C', 1 'F', 1 'G')
  - Output: `5` (correct)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'`
  - Frequency: `freq = [0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0]` (for 'A' to 'G')
  - Missing: `sum(max(0, 1 - f) for f in freq) = 1` (missing 'A')
  - Output: `1` (correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed for each test case based on the given problem description and constraints. The logic and implementation are sound and produce the expected results.
