### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, which represent the length of array `a`, the length of array `b`, and the required number of matching elements, respectively.
   - It then reads the elements of array `a` and array `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - The function initializes a list `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1` (where `max_val` is 1,000,000) to count the occurrences of each element in `b`.
   - It iterates over the elements of `b` and increments the corresponding index in `cnt_b`.

3. **Initial Subsegment Check:**
   - The function initializes `curr` to 0, which will keep track of the number of matching elements in the current subsegment of `a`.
   - It iterates over the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if each element is in `b_values` (a set of elements in `b`).
   - If an element is in `b_values`, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

4. **Sliding Window:**
   - The function uses a sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m`.
   - It iterates from `0` to `n - m - 1` and updates the window by:
     - Adding the element at the new position `i + m` to the current subsegment.
     - Removing the element at the old position `i` from the current subsegment.
   - For each new element added to the window, it decrements the count in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is non-negative.
   - For each old element removed from the window, it increments the count in `cnt_b` and decrements `curr` if the count in `cnt_b` is positive.
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments the answer `ans`.

5. **Resetting Counts:**
   - After processing each test case, the function resets the counts in `cnt_b` for the elements in `b_values` to 0 to prepare for the next test case.

### Correctness:
- The function correctly implements the sliding window approach to count the number of good subsegments.
- It correctly updates the counts and the current number of matching elements as the window slides.
- The function handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
