### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`.
   - If not, we need to print one such string that is not a subsequence of `s`.

2. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.

3. **Subsequence Checking:**
   - The program uses a bitwise approach to track the presence of characters in `s`.
   - `cur` is a bitmask where each bit represents whether a character from 'a' to 'a' + `k` - 1 has been seen in the current subsequence.
   - `cnt` keeps track of the number of complete subsequences of length `n` that have been found.

4. **Bitmask Update:**
   - For each character `ss` in `s`, the program calculates `cur_ss` which is the position of the character in the alphabet (0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', etc.).
   - It updates the bitmask `cur` to include the current character if it hasn't been included yet.
   - If `cur` becomes `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen in the current subsequence, and `cnt` is incremented.

5. **Output:**
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints 'YES' because it means all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string of length `n` that is not a subsequence of `s`:
     - It finds a character that is not present in the current subsequence using the bitmask `cur`.
     - It appends this character to `ans` and then appends 'a' enough times to make the string of length `n`.

6. **Issues:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the construction of the string that is not a subsequence of `s`.
   - The logic for constructing the string is flawed. It appends a character that is not in the current subsequence and then appends 'a' multiple times, which may not be a valid non-subsequence string.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences, we need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets and check if each one is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, print 'NO' and that string.

### Correctness:
**False**

The program's logic for constructing a string that is not a subsequence is incorrect. It does not ensure that the constructed string is a valid non-subsequence string. Additionally, the program does not generate all possible strings of length `n` to check if they are subsequences of `s`.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def is_subsequence(s, pattern):
    it = iter(s)
    return all(char in it for char in pattern)

def generate_all_strings(n, k):
    from itertools import product
    return [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        all_strings = generate_all_strings(n, k)
        for pattern in all_strings:
            if not is_subsequence(s, pattern):
                print('NO')
                print(pattern)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **is_subsequence Function:**
   - This function checks if a given `pattern` is a subsequence of `s` by using an iterator to ensure the order of characters is maintained.

2. **generate_all_strings Function:**
   - This function generates all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets using `itertools.product`.

3. **Main Function:**
   - For each test case, it generates all possible strings of length `n`.
   - It checks if each string is a subsequence of `s`.
   - If any string is not a subsequence, it prints 'NO' and that string.
   - If all strings are subsequences, it prints 'YES'.
