### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Vladislav lays down cards in a specific order: first the odd-numbered cards, then the cards that are twice an odd number, then three times an odd number, and so on.
   - For each step, he lays down the smallest possible cards that fit the criteria.
   - The task is to determine the k-th card laid down.

2. **Program Logic:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - The while loop continues until `n` is zero:
     - `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards in the current step.
     - `n` is reduced by `m` to account for the cards that have been laid down.
     - `m` is appended to the list `L`.
   - `tot` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the total number of cards laid down so far.
   - `pow` is initialized to 1 to keep track of the current multiplier (1 for odd, 2 for twice an odd, etc.).
   - The for loop iterates over the list `L`:
     - If `k` is within the range of cards laid down in the current step (`tot < k and k <= tot + a`), it prints the k-th card.
     - `tot` is updated to include the number of cards laid down in the current step.
     - `pow` is doubled to move to the next step.

3. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly calculates the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - It correctly identifies the step in which the k-th card is laid down.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly computes the k-th card in the current step.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 1 correctly.
   - It also handles the case where `k` is equal to `n` correctly, as shown in the last test case of the example.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The program is efficient enough to handle the constraints (up to \(5 \cdot 10^4\) test cases and \(n \leq 10^9\)).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. It handles the given test cases and constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
