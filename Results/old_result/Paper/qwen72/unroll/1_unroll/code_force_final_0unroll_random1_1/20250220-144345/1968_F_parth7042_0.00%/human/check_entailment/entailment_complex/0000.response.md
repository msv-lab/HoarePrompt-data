### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a valid approach for handling input in competitive programming, especially when the input size is large and reading line by line might be inefficient.
   - The program uses an index `idx` to keep track of the current position in the input list. This is a good practice to avoid multiple calls to `input()` and to ensure that the input is read in the correct order.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the prefix XOR for the array `a` and stores it in the list `pf`. The prefix XOR at position `i` is the XOR of all elements from `a[1]` to `a[i]`.
   - This is a crucial step because the XOR of a subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` can be efficiently computed as `pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XORs:**
   - The program uses a dictionary `mp` to map each prefix XOR value to the list of indices where it occurs. This helps in quickly checking if there are multiple segments with the same XOR value.
   - The initial entry `(0): [0]` is added to handle cases where the subarray itself has a prefix XOR of 0.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query `(l, r)`, the program computes the XOR of the subarray `a[l]` to `a[r]` using the prefix XORs.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is 0, it means the subarray can be split into segments where each segment has an XOR of 0, which is a valid interesting subarray.
   - If the XOR is not 0, the program checks if there are indices `i` and `j` such that `pf[i] == pf[j]` and `l <= i < j <= r`. This is done using binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices in the lists stored in `mp`.

5. **Output:**
   - The results are stored in a list `results` and printed at the end of the function.
   - Each test case's results are separated by an empty string, which is a correct way to format the output according to the problem description.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly handles the input and processes each test case.
- The prefix XOR calculation and the use of the dictionary to map XOR values are efficient and correct.
- The query processing logic is sound and correctly identifies interesting subarrays.
- The output format matches the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
