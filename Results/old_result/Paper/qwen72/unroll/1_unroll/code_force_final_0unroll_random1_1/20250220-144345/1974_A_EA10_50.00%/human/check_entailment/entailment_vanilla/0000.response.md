### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by reading the number of test cases, `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The program calculates `z` as `(y + 1) // 2`. This is intended to determine the minimum number of screens required to place all 2x2 icons.
   - The formula `(y + 1) // 2` is used to ensure that if `y` is odd, it rounds up to the next whole number. This is because each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons (since a screen is 5x3, which has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells).

3. **Remaining Space Calculation:**
   - The program then calculates `m` as `15 * z - y * 4`. This is intended to determine the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons.
   - `15 * z` gives the total number of cells available on `z` screens.
   - `y * 4` gives the total number of cells occupied by `y` 2x2 icons.
   - `15 * z - y * 4` gives the remaining cells available for 1x1 icons.

4. **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons:**
   - If the remaining space `m` is less than the number of 1x1 icons `x`, the program adjusts `z` to account for the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons.
   - The adjustment is done using the formula `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This formula calculates the number of additional screens required to fit the remaining 1x1 icons. The `+ 15 - 1` part ensures that any remaining icons that don't fill a complete screen still count as needing an additional screen.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `z` for each test case, which represents the minimum number of screens required.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Initial Calculation of `z`:**
  - The formula `(y + 1) // 2` correctly calculates the minimum number of screens needed to place all 2x2 icons. This is because each screen can fit at most 2 of the 2x2 icons, and if `y` is odd, it rounds up to ensure all icons are placed.

- **Remaining Space Calculation:**
  - The formula `15 * z - y * 4` correctly calculates the remaining space on the screens after placing all 2x2 icons. This is because each screen has 15 cells, and each 2x2 icon takes 4 cells.

- **Adjusting for 1x1 Icons:**
  - The formula `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15` correctly calculates the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons. The `+ 15 - 1` part ensures that any remaining icons that don't fill a complete screen still count as needing an additional screen.

- **Output:**
  - The program correctly prints the minimum number of screens required for each test case.
