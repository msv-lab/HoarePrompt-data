### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n` and the list of city coordinates `cities`.
   - It then reads the number of queries `m` and processes each query.
   - This part of the program is correct.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `back` and `forward` to large values to handle edge cases (first and last cities).
   - For each city `i`, it checks the distance to the previous city `back` and the next city `forward`.
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the cost to 1 (indicating the closest city is the next one).
   - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.
   - **Issue:** The function `func_1` incorrectly sets the cost to the distance to the next city when the distance to the previous city is smaller. It should set the cost to the distance to the previous city instead. This is a critical error that affects the correctness of the program.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates two prefix sum arrays: `pref_sum_f` for the forward direction and `pref_sum_b` for the backward direction.
   - `pref_sum_f` is calculated based on the costs to the closest city in the forward direction.
   - `pref_sum_b` is calculated similarly but for the backward direction after reversing the `cities` list.
   - The prefix sum arrays are correctly initialized and updated.
   - This part of the program is correct.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program determines the direction of travel (forward or backward) based on the indices `a` and `b`.
   - It then calculates the minimum cost using the appropriate prefix sum array.
   - This part of the program is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by initializing `back` and `forward` to large values.
   - The prefix sum arrays are correctly initialized and updated.
   - This part of the program is correct.

6. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The algorithm correctly identifies the closest city for each city, except for the issue mentioned in the "Closest City Calculation" section.
   - The prefix sum arrays are used to efficiently calculate the minimum cost for each query.
   - The program correctly handles the direction of travel and uses the appropriate prefix sum array.

### Conclusion:
The program has a critical error in the `func_1` function where it incorrectly sets the cost to the distance to the next city when the distance to the previous city is smaller. This error leads to incorrect calculations of the closest city costs, which in turn affects the prefix sum arrays and the final query results.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
