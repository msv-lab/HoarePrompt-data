The function reads multiple test cases from the input. For each test case, it reads the number of sides of a polygon (`n`), the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (`x`), the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (`y`), and a list of `x` chosen vertices. It calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed by choosing additional vertices, ensuring no two chosen vertices are adjacent. The function prints the minimum of the calculated number of triangular pieces (`ans`) and `n - 2` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function completes and the input variables are reset for each new test case.
