The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each defined by two integers `n` and `k` (where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it prints a value based on the following conditions: If \( k \) is greater than \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), it calculates and prints a value \( y \) which is \( 2^{(i - 1)} \times (2 \times f - 1) \), where \( i \) is the number of iterations needed to reach or exceed \( k \) by adding the largest possible odd number from \( n \), and \( f \) is the difference between \( k \) and the sum of the largest possible odd numbers up to \( i-1 \). If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( \frac{(n + 1)}{2} \), it directly prints \( 2 \times k - 1 \). The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged after the function execution.
