Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Even Dimensions**:
   - The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0` is not sufficient to determine if Bob can form another rectangle. For example, a 2x2 rectangle can be cut into two 1x2 rectangles and then reformed into a 1x4 rectangle, which is a different rectangle. However, the program will print "yes" for this case, which is correct, but the logic is flawed and will fail for other cases.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Differences**:
   - The conditions `(a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)` are incorrect and will always evaluate to `False` because they are comparing tuples with integers. This condition is not meaningful in the context of the problem.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Odd Differences**:
   - The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` is redundant and will always evaluate to `True` because the modulo operation will always result in either 0 or 1 for any integer. This means the program will print "yes" for all cases where the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, which is not always correct.

### Correct Logic:
To determine if Bob can form another rectangle, we need to check if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then re-form a different rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, Bob cannot form a different rectangle because cutting an odd-length side will always result in two smaller rectangles with odd dimensions, and re-forming them will not produce a new rectangle.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This corrected program will correctly determine if Bob can form another rectangle based on the problem description.
