Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where `n` is even and `m` is odd, or vice versa, but `m` is less than `n`. For example, if `n = 4` and `m = 3`, the program will output "No" because it checks `elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0`, but it should output "Yes" because it is possible to achieve a tower of 3 cubes after 4 moves by adding a cube 3 times and removing a cube once. 

The correct logic should be that if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, then it is possible to build a tower of `m` cubes after `n` moves. The program should be modified to reflect this logic.
