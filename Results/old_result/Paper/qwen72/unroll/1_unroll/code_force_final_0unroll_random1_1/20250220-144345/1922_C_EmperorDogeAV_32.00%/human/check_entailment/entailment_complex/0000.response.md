### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of cities `n`, the coordinates of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - The coordinates of the cities are stored in a list `cities` and converted to integers.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - It initializes `prog_cities` as a list of zeros with length `n-1`.
   - For each city `i` (except the last one), it calculates the distance to the previous city (`back`) and the next city (`forward`).
   - If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 (indicating a 1-coin travel to the closest city).
   - Otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the distance to the next city.
   - This function correctly handles the edge cases where `i` is the first or last city in the list.

3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates prefix sums for the forward and backward directions.
   - `pref_sum_f` is the prefix sum of `forward_cities`.
   - `pref_sum_b` is the prefix sum of `backward_cities` after reversing the `cities` list.
   - These prefix sums are used to efficiently compute the minimum cost of travel between any two cities.

4. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program determines the minimum cost to travel from city `a` to city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum.
   - The cost is calculated as the difference between the prefix sums at the respective indices.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints where the cities are in strictly ascending order and the closest city is unique for each city.
   - The prefix sums are calculated correctly, and the program efficiently handles the large number of queries.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Distance Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it incorrectly sets `forward` and `back` to extreme values initially.
  - The condition `if i < n - 1: forward = cities[i + 1]` should be `if i < n - 2: forward = cities[i + 1]` to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices.
  - The condition `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back): prog_cities[i] = 1` should be `if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1]): prog_cities[i] = 1` to correctly compare the distances.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
    
    return prog_cities
```

### Final Correctness:
- After correcting the issues in `func_1`, the program should work correctly for the given problem description and constraints.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program contains a logical error in the `func_1` function that affects the correct calculation of the closest city distances. Once this error is fixed, the program should be correct.
