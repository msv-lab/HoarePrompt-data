### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number of elements in an array `a` that can be made equal by adding a permutation `p` to `a`.
   - A permutation `p` of length `n` is an array of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
   - After adding the permutation, we need to count the occurrences of each number and find the maximum count.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates over the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the array and the array `a` itself.
   - It then calculates the maximum value `m` in the array `a`.
   - A new array `new` is created where each element is `m - arr[i] + 1`.
   - This new array is sorted.
   - A set `ans` is used to collect unique values from `new` that are within the range of the permutation (1 to `n`).
   - Finally, the length of the set `ans` is printed, which represents the number of unique values in `new` that can be part of the permutation.

3. **Correctness of the Algorithm**:
   - The algorithm aims to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
   - The key insight is that if we want to make the elements of `a` equal, the best way is to add a permutation such that the resulting values are as close as possible to the maximum value in `a`.
   - The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` ensures that the resulting values are within the range of the permutation.
   - Sorting `new` and collecting unique values that are within the range of the permutation (1 to `n`) helps in identifying the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.
   - The length of the set `ans` gives the number of unique values that can be part of the permutation, which is the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.

4. **Validation of the Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment states that the provided functions do not directly solve the problem.
   - However, the main logic of the program, which is not part of the provided functions, does attempt to solve the problem.
   - The main logic correctly reads the input, processes it, and outputs the result for each test case.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_3` are used to read the number of test cases and the array `a`, respectively, which are necessary for the program to function.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The main logic of the program is correct and follows the problem requirements.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_3` are used appropriately to read the input.
   - The program correctly calculates and outputs the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation.
