Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` from the input. It then counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (`cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (`cut0`) in the string `a`. After processing the string, if `cut0` is 0, it prints `cut1 + 1`; otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`. The variables `cut0` and `cut1` are reset to 0 for each test case. The function does not return any value, but it prints the result for each test case. **
