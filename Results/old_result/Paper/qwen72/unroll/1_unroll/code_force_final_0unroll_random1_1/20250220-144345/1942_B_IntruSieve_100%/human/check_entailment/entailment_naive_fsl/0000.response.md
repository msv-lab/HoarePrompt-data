Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly handle the construction of the permutation `p` based on the array `a`. Specifically, the logic for determining the value of `mex` and updating the `used` set is flawed. Here is a specific case where the program fails:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 1 1 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 3
```

**Explanation:**
For the input `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the expected permutation `p` is `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. However, the program incorrectly sets the last element of `mex` to `3` instead of `4`. This is because the logic for updating `minn` and `used` does not correctly account for the case where `arr[i]` is positive and the MEX value should be updated accordingly.

The correct approach should involve maintaining a set of used elements and correctly calculating the MEX value for each prefix of the permutation. The provided program fails to do this accurately, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
