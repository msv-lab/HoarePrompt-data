The function `func_1` is designed to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for each given `a`.

The function returns a result based on the input parameters for each test case. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints and relationships. Therefore, the general functionality of the function `func_1` is to process each test case and return a result that depends on the input parameters `n` and `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `a` for multiple test cases. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the input parameters `n` and `a`.**
