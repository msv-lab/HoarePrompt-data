Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical error in the way it calculates the time for a query when the query point does not exactly match one of the known points. Specifically, the issue is in the following lines:

```python
ql -= a[s - 1]
m += b[s - 1]
m += bd[s] * ql / ad[s]
```

The problem is that `ad[s]` and `bd[s]` are not correctly used to calculate the time. The `ad` list represents the distance between consecutive known points, and `bd` represents the time difference between consecutive known points. However, the speed `v` is calculated as `ad[i] / bd[i]`, which is the distance divided by the time, giving the speed in units per minute. When calculating the time for a query, the program should use the speed `v[s]` to determine the time taken to travel the remaining distance `ql` after subtracting the distance up to the last known point.

The correct calculation should be:

```python
ql -= a[s - 1]
m += b[s - 1]
m += ql / v[s]
```

Additionally, the program should handle the case where the query point is exactly at one of the known points more gracefully. The current implementation already does this correctly, but the rest of the logic needs to be fixed.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        v = [0]
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            v.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) / (b[i] - b[i - 1]))
        for l in range(q):
            ql = int(input())
            s = bisect_left(a, ql)
            if a[s] == ql:
                print(b[s], end=' ')
                continue
            ql -= a[s - 1]
            m = b[s - 1] + (ql / v[s])
            print(int(m), end=' ')
        print()
```

This corrected version should now correctly calculate the time for each query, rounding down to the nearest integer as required.
