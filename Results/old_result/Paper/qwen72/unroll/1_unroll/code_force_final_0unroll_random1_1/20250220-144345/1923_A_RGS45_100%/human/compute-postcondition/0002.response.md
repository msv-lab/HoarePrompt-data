Output State: **The function will print the number of zeros between the first and last occurrence of 1 for each test case, and the variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated for each iteration of the loop. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the values of `n`, `arr`, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be the final values from the last test case.**
