Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program aims to solve the problem of assigning transition videos (either funny or scary) to ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. However, the program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Assignment of Transition Videos:**
   - The program attempts to assign 'F' or 'S' based on whether the scenario is in the `sa` or `sb` list. However, this approach does not guarantee that the transition videos will meet the requirement of not having more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.
   - The logic of assigning 'F' or 'S' based on the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `sb` is flawed. It does not consider the overall sequence of transitions when the scenarios are permuted, which is crucial for the problem.

2. **Handling of Undecided Transitions:**
   - The program does not handle the assignment of 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions in a way that ensures the global constraint is met. It simply assigns 'F' or 'S' based on the presence of the scenario in the `sa` or `sb` list, which is not sufficient to prevent long sequences of the same type.

3. **Symmetry Constraint:**
   - The program does not explicitly ensure that the matrix remains symmetric after assigning the undecided transitions. While the input is guaranteed to be symmetric, the program's logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' does not guarantee that the output will maintain this symmetry.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `n` is small (e.g., `n = 2` or `n = 3`), where the constraints are trivial to satisfy but the current logic might not work as intended.

### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve:
- Ensuring the matrix remains symmetric.
- Using a more sophisticated method to assign 'F' or 'S' to the undecided transitions, such as a greedy algorithm or backtracking, to ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect and does not meet the problem's requirements.
