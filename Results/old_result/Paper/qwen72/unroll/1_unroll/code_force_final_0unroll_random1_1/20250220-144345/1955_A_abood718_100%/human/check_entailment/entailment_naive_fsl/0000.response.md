Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of yogurts `A` is 1. According to the problem description, the output should be the price of one yogurt `B` when `A` is 1. However, the current logic in the program does not account for this specific case. For example, if the input is `1 5 9`, the program will incorrectly output `9` instead of `5`.
