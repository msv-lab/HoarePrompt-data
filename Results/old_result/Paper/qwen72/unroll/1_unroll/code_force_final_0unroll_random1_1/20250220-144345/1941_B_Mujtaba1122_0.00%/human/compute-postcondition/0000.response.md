The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1)` will execute if `n - 1` is greater than 1, which means `n` must be greater than 2. Given that `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= len(list)`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 3. Before the loop starts, `i` is 1.

State: **`list` is a list of non-negative integers, `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= len(list), `i` is 1**
