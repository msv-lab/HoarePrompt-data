### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `l`, and the number of queries `m`.

2. **Closest City Calculation:**
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum cost to travel from a city to its closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - `d1` is initialized to store the cost of traveling from the second city to the third city.
   - `d2` is initialized to store the cost of traveling from the second-to-last city to the last city.

3. **Forward Direction Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the cities from the second to the second-to-last city.
   - For each city `i`, it checks if the distance to the next city `i+1` is less than the distance to the previous city `i-1`.
   - If true, it updates `d1[i+2]` to be 1 coin more than the cost to travel to the next city `i+1`.
   - If false, it updates `d1[i+2]` to be the distance to the next city `i+1` plus the cost to travel to the next city `i+1`.

4. **Backward Direction Calculation:**
   - The program iterates through the cities from the second-to-last to the second city.
   - For each city `i`, it checks if the distance to the previous city `i-1` is less than the distance to the next city `i+1`.
   - If true, it updates `d2[i]` to be 1 coin more than the cost to travel to the next city `i+1`.
   - If false, it updates `d2[i]` to be the distance to the previous city `i-1` plus the cost to travel to the next city `i+1`.

5. **Query Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of queries `m`.
   - For each query, it reads the cities `x` and `y`.
   - If `y` is greater than `x`, it prints the cost to travel from city `x` to city `y` using the forward direction costs stored in `d1`.
   - If `y` is less than `x`, it prints the cost to travel from city `x` to city `y` using the backward direction costs stored in `d2`.

### Issues:
- **Initialization of `d1` and `d2`:**
  - The initialization of `d1[2]` and `d2[n-1]` is incorrect. The closest city to the second city should be the first city, and the closest city to the last city should be the second-to-last city. Therefore, `d1[2]` should be 1 and `d2[n-1]` should be 1.
  - The program should initialize `d1[1]` to 0 and `d2[n]` to 0 to handle the boundary conditions correctly.

- **Cost Calculation:**
  - The cost calculation in the forward and backward loops is incorrect. The program should only add 1 coin if the closest city is the next or previous city, not the cumulative distance.
  - The correct approach is to store the index of the closest city for each city and then use this information to calculate the minimum cost.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize closest city arrays
        closest_left = [0] * n
        closest_right = [0] * n
        
        # Calculate closest city to the left for each city
        for i in range(1, n):
            closest_left[i] = i - 1
        
        # Calculate closest city to the right for each city
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            closest_right[i] = i + 1
        
        # Precompute the minimum cost to travel from each city to the last city
        cost_to_last = [0] * n
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            cost_to_last[i] = min(l[closest_right[i]] - l[i] + cost_to_last[closest_right[i]], 1 + cost_to_last[i + 1])
        
        # Precompute the minimum cost to travel from each city to the first city
        cost_to_first = [0] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            cost_to_first[i] = min(l[i] - l[closest_left[i]] + cost_to_first[closest_left[i]], 1 + cost_to_first[i - 1])
        
        m = int(input())
        for _ in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(cost_to_last[x - 1] - cost_to_last[y - 1])
            else:
                print(cost_to_first[y - 1] - cost_to_first[x - 1])

```
