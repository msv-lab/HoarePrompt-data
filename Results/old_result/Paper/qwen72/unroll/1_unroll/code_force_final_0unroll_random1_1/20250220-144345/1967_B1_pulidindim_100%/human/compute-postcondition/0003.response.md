The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function should be called with two arguments, `n` and `m`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `m` within the specified range and return a result based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6) and returns a result based on these inputs.**
