Reasoning:  
The provided program is designed to solve the problem of finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, based on the periodicities of the signs and the requirement that the signs must occur sequentially. The function `func_1` iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it calculates the year in which each sign will occur, starting from year 0. 

The key logic in the function is:
- For each sign `ai`, if the current year `current_year` is a multiple of `ai`, the next year to wait for the next sign is `current_year + ai`.
- If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next year to wait for the next sign is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.

This logic ensures that the signs occur in the correct sequence and that the year for the next sign is always the smallest possible year that meets the criteria.

Let's verify the program with the provided example:

1. For the test case `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
   - Start at year 0.
   - First sign (3): Next year is 3.
   - Second sign (2): Next year is 4.
   - Third sign (4): Next year is 8.
   - Fourth sign (5): Next year is 10.
   - Fifth sign (9): Next year is 18.
   - Sixth sign (18): Next year is 36.
   - Output: 36 (correct).

2. For the test case `1 2 3 4 5`:
   - Start at year 0.
   - First sign (1): Next year is 1.
   - Second sign (2): Next year is 2.
   - Third sign (3): Next year is 3.
   - Fourth sign (4): Next year is 4.
   - Fifth sign (5): Next year is 5.
   - Output: 5 (correct).

3. For the test case `1 1 1 1 1`:
   - Start at year 0.
   - First sign (1): Next year is 1.
   - Second sign (1): Next year is 2.
   - Third sign (1): Next year is 3.
   - Fourth sign (1): Next year is 4.
   - Fifth sign (1): Next year is 5.
   - Output: 5 (correct).

4. For the test case `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
   - Start at year 0.
   - First sign (50): Next year is 50.
   - Second sign (30): Next year is 60.
   - Third sign (711): Next year is 711.
   - Fourth sign (200): Next year is 800.
   - Fifth sign (503): Next year is 1006.
   - Sixth sign (1006): Next year is 2012.
   - Output: 2012 (correct).

The program correctly handles the given test cases and produces the expected output. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
