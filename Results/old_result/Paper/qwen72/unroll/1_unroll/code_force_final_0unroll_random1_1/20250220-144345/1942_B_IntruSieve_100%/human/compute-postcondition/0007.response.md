The only objects in the loop head are `itm` and `mex`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `mex` list. If `mex` has at least one element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `itm` is not yet defined, and `mex` must be a list of integers. For the loop to execute, `mex` must have at least one element, and `itm` will be the first element of `mex`.

State: **`mex` is a list of integers representing the MEX values computed for each element in `arr` and must have at least one element, `itm` is the first element of `mex`**
