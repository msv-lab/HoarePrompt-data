Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an array of positive integers and a series of queries. For each query, it determines and prints whether the specified subarray is "good" based on the condition that the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of ones in the subarray, provided the subarray length is greater than 1. If the condition is not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values, and the final state of the program after the function concludes is that all test cases have been processed and the results for each query have been printed. **
