Output State: **After the loop executes all iterations, `lst` will contain `x - 1` new entries where each key `a` has a list of values `b` appended to it. Similarly, `rev` will contain `x - 1` new entries where each key `b` has a list of values `a` appended to it. The values of `n`, `u_1`, and `y` remain unchanged.**
