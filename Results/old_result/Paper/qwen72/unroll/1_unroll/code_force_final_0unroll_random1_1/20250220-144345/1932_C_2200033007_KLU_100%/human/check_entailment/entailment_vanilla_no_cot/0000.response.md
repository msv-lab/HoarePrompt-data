Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the required logic. Specifically, the function `func_1` is supposed to output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` at each step before removing an element, but the current implementation does not compute the product of the remaining elements correctly.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Product Calculation**:
   - The program appends the elements to be removed to the list `b` and then calculates the product in reverse order. However, it should calculate the product of the remaining elements at each step before removing an element.

2. **Order of Removal**:
   - The program correctly identifies which element to remove based on the command ('L' or 'R'), but it does not correctly compute the product of the remaining elements at each step.

3. **Product Calculation in Reverse**:
   - The program calculates the product in reverse order, which is not necessary and does not match the problem description. The product should be calculated in the order of the commands.

To correct the program, you should compute the product of the remaining elements at each step before removing an element. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))

def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    product = 1
    for i in range(n):
        product = product * a[l] * a[r] % m
        b.append(product % m)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            product = product * pow(a[l], -1, m) % m
            l += 1
        else:
            product = product * pow(a[r], -1, m) % m
            r -= 1
    return b
```

In this corrected version:
- `product` is initialized to 1.
- For each command, the product of the remaining elements is calculated and appended to the list `b`.
- After appending the product, the element to be removed is accounted for by multiplying the product by the modular inverse of the element to be removed (using `pow(a[l], -1, m)` or `pow(a[r], -1, m)`).

This ensures that the product is correctly updated at each step and the output matches the problem description.
