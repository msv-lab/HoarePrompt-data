The function `func_2` does not accept any input parameters. It reads a line from standard input, which should contain at least one integer separated by whitespace. The function returns an iterator that converts each string in the line to an integer. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the user has an iterator that can be used to access the integers from the input line.
