Reasoning:

The function `func` is intended to solve the problem of determining if Bob can form another rectangle from the given rectangle of size \(a \times b\) by cutting it into two rectangles and rearranging them. However, the logic within the function is flawed.

1. **First Condition**:
   ```python
   if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. If they are, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle. This is correct because an even \(a \times b\) rectangle can be cut into two \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\) or \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\) rectangles, and these can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.

2. **Second Condition**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b):
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is incorrect. The expressions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples and will always evaluate to `True` because they are not being used as boolean conditions. The correct condition should be:
   ```python
   elif a == b:
       print('no')
   ```
   If \(a\) and \(b\) are equal, the rectangle is a square, and cutting it will result in two smaller squares. These two smaller squares can only form the original square, so the answer should be "No".

3. **Third Condition**:
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   This condition is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1 (or -1 if \(a < b\)). The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0` will always evaluate to `True` because it covers all possible non-zero values of \((a - b) % 2\). The correct condition should be:
   ```python
   elif (a - b) % 2 == 0:
       print('yes')
   ```
   If the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle. This is because an even difference means one of the dimensions is even, allowing for a valid cut.

4. **Fourth Condition**:
   ```python
   else:
       print('no')
   ```
   This condition is correct. If none of the above conditions are met, Bob cannot form another rectangle.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The second and third conditions are particularly problematic and need to be fixed.

Correctness: **False**
