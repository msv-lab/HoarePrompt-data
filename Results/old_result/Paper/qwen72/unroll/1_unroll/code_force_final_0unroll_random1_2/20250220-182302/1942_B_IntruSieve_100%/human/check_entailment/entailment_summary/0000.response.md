Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` from an array `a` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the sequence.
   - Given `a`, we need to find a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the above condition.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the elements of the permutation `p`.
   - It also initializes `minn` to 0, which represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in the permutation.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of which integers have already been used in the permutation.
   - The program iterates over each element `arr[i]`:
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it adds `minn` to `mex` and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `arr[i]` is non-positive, it adds `abs(arr[i] - minn)` to `mex` and marks `abs(arr[i] - minn)` as used.
   - After processing all elements, it prints the elements of `mex`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for handling positive `arr[i]` is correct because it ensures that the smallest unused integer is added to the permutation, which aligns with the MEX definition.
   - The logic for handling non-positive `arr[i]` is also correct because it ensures that the value `abs(arr[i] - minn)` is added to the permutation, which should be the correct value to satisfy the equation `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i = arr[i]`.

4. **Validation with Examples**:
   - **Example 1**: `n = 5`, `arr = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
     - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1` (MEX of [0] is 1, so `p_1 = 0`)
     - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1] is 2, so `p_2 = 1`)
     - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2` (MEX of [0, 1, 4] is 2, so `p_3 = 4`)
     - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1, 4, 2] is 3, so `p_4 = 2`)
     - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2` (MEX of [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is 5, so `p_5 = 3`)
     - The output `0 1 4 2 3` is valid.
   - **Example 2**: `n = 5`, `arr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
     - `a_1 = MEX(0) - 0 = 1` (MEX of [0] is 1, so `p_1 = 0`)
     - `a_2 = MEX(0, 1) - 1 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1] is 2, so `p_2 = 1`)
     - `a_3 = MEX(0, 1, 2) - 2 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1, 2] is 3, so `p_3 = 2`)
     - `a_4 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3) - 3 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3] is 4, so `p_4 = 3`)
     - `a_5 = MEX(0, 1, 2, 3, 4) - 4 = 1` (MEX of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] is 5, so `p_5 = 4`)
     - The output `0 1 2 3 4` is valid.
   - **Example 3**: `n = 3`, `arr = [-2, 1, 2]`
     - `a_1 = MEX(2) - 2 = -2` (MEX of [2] is 0, so `p_1 = 2`)
     - `a_2 = MEX(2, 0) - 0 = 1` (MEX of [2, 0] is 1, so `p_2 = 0`)
     - `a_3 = MEX(2, 0, 1) - 1 = 2` (MEX of [2, 0, 1] is 3, so `p_3 = 1`)
     - The output `2 0 1` is valid.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the MEX definition.
   - The logic handles both positive and non-positive values in `arr` appropriately.
   - The program prints the correct permutation for the given examples.
