### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads the array `l` of length `n`.

2. **Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - The program initializes two prefix sum arrays `p` and `c` with an initial value of 0.
   - `p` is used to store the prefix sums of the array `l`.
   - `c` is used to store the prefix counts of the number of 1s in the array `l`.

3. **Building Prefix Sum Arrays**:
   - The program iterates through the array `l` and updates the prefix sum arrays:
     - `i` is the running sum of the elements in `l`.
     - `j` is the running count of the number of 1s in `l`.
     - `p` is updated with the running sum `i`.
     - `c` is updated with the running count `j`.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program reads the indices `a` and `b` for the subarray.
   - It calculates the sum of the subarray `s` using the prefix sum array `p`.
   - It calculates the count of 1s in the subarray `i` using the prefix count array `c`.
   - The program then checks if the subarray is good using the condition:
     - `b - a + 1 > 1` ensures that the subarray has more than one element.
     - `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` ensures that the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is at least the number of 1s in the subarray.

5. **Condition Explanation**:
   - The condition `s - (b - a + 1) >= i` is derived from the requirement that the sum of the subarray `s` should be at least the length of the subarray plus the number of 1s in the subarray. This is because for each element in the subarray, we need to find a corresponding element in the array `b` that is different and positive. If the sum of the subarray is at least the length of the subarray plus the number of 1s, it means we have enough "extra" sum to ensure that all elements in `b` can be different and positive.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise.

### Correctness:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The use of prefix sum and prefix count arrays allows for efficient query processing.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: True**
