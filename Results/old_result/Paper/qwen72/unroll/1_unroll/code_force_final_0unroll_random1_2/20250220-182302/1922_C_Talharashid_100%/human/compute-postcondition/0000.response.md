The only variable in the loop head is `i`, and the loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`. The loop will run `int(input())` times, where `int(input())` should be the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must be at least 1, which aligns with the given state that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

Since the loop head only involves `i` and the input value, and the input value should be the number of test cases `t`, we need to ensure that `int(input())` is at least 1. The variable `i` will start at 0, as is the default behavior of `range()` in Python.

Therefore, the state should be adjusted to reflect that `int(input())` is at least 1, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be at least 1**
