The function `func` accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. 

- `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, representing the number of test cases.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, representing the length of the list `a`.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each element `a_j` is such that 0 <= a_j <= 10^9, representing the input list of integers.

The function returns different outputs based on the input values:

- Case_1: If `n` is less than 3, the function returns an error message indicating that the list must contain at least 3 elements.
- Case_2: For each test case, the function returns the result of some operation performed on the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (number of test cases), `n` (length of the list), and `a` (list of integers). If `n` is less than 3, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns the result of some operation performed on the list `a` for each test case.**
