The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) representing the length of the lost string, and a list of integers `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` (0 ≤ a_i < n) represents the trace of the string. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5. It is guaranteed that for each trace, there exists at least one valid string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z.
