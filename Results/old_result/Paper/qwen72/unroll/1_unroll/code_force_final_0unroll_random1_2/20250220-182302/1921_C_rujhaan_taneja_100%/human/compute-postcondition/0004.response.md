Functionality: ** The function reads multiple test cases from the input, where each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `f`, two integers `a` and `b`, and a list of `n` integers `arr`. For each test case, the function checks if the sum of certain calculated values (based on the elements of `arr` and the constants `a` and `b`) plus a fixed cost is less than `f`. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value. After processing all test cases, the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the elements of `arr` remain unchanged. **
