Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem as described. However, this assessment is based on a misunderstanding of the problem and the functions. Let's break down the program and its components to understand why it is actually correct.

### Problem Breakdown
The problem requires counting the number of permutations of length `n` that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The key observations are:
1. The first element of the permutation must be a prefix maximum.
2. The last element of the permutation must be a suffix maximum.
3. The intersection of the prefix and suffix maximums must be the same element (the maximum of the permutation).

### Program Analysis
The program uses a combination of combinatorial mathematics and modular arithmetic to solve the problem. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Precomputation of Factorials**:
   ```python
   facts = [1]
   ch = 1
   for i in range(1, 200002):
       ch *= i
       ch %= 1000000007
       facts.append(ch)
   ```
   This part precomputes the factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\) up to \(200000\). The factorials are stored in the list `facts`.

2. **Reading Input and Initial Checks**:
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       (n, m1, m2) = map(int, input().split())
       p = list(map(int, input().split()))
       s = list(map(int, input().split()))
       if p[-1] != s[0] or p[0] != 1 or s[-1] != n:
           print(0)
       else:
           ...
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m1`, and `m2`.
   - It reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the suffix maximums `s`.
   - It checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, the first prefix maximum is 1, and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the program prints 0, which is correct because the permutation cannot satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   ```python
   ans = 1
   kol = n
   for x in s:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[n - x] * facts[kol - 1 + x - n])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = n - x
   kol = s[0] - 1
   p2 = []
   for i in range(m1 - 2, -1, -1):
       p2.append(p[i])
   for x in p2:
       cnk = func_2(facts[kol - 1], facts[x - 1] * facts[kol - x])
       ans *= cnk
       ans %= 1000000007
       kol = x - 1
   for i in range(m1 - 1):
       ans *= facts[p[i + 1] - p[i] - 1]
       ans %= 1000000007
   for i in range(m2 - 1):
       ans *= facts[s[i + 1] - s[i] - 1]
       ans %= 1000000007
   print(ans)
   ```
   - The program initializes `ans` to 1 and `kol` to `n`.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums `s` and calculates the number of ways to arrange the elements between the current suffix maximum and the next one using the function `func_2`.
   - It then reverses the prefix maximums (excluding the last one) and iterates over them, again using `func_2` to calculate the number of ways to arrange the elements.
   - Finally, it multiplies the results by the factorials of the gaps between consecutive prefix and suffix maximums.

### Function Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(a, b):
       if b == 0:
           return (1, 0)
       if a < b:
           (c, d) = func_1(b, a)
           return (d, c)
       if a % b == 0:
           return (1, -(a // b - 1))
       (c, d) = func_1(b, a % b)
       return (d, c - a // b * d)
   ```
   - This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients `c` and `d` such that \(a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b)\).
   - It is used to find the modular inverse of a number, which is essential for the combinatorial calculations.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   ```python
   def func_2(a, b):
       c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
       return c * a % 1000000007
   ```
   - This function calculates the modular inverse of `b` modulo \(10^9 + 7\) using `func_1`.
   - It then returns the result of \(a \cdot \text{modular\_inverse}(b) \mod 1000000007\), which is used to compute binomial coefficients modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Correctness of the Program
- The program correctly checks the initial conditions for the prefix and suffix maximums.
- It uses combinatorial mathematics to count the number of valid permutations.
- The use of modular arithmetic and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm ensures that the calculations are performed correctly under the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly solves the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are essential for the combinatorial calculations and modular arithmetic required to count the permutations.

Final: **True**
