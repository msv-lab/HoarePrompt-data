The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by two lists of integers `a` (of length `n`) and `b` (of length `m`). It then counts how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also in `b`. The function prints the count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function resets the count array `cnt_b` to zero for all elements in the set `b_values`. The function does not return any value.
