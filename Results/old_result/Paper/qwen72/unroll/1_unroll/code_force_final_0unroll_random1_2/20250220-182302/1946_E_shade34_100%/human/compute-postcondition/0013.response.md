Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. It returns a tuple `(x, y)` based on the following conditions:
1. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0)`.
2. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is not 0, the function returns the values of `d` and `c` as they were returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`, swapping their positions.
3. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`, the function returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
4. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`, the function returns `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `d` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`. **
