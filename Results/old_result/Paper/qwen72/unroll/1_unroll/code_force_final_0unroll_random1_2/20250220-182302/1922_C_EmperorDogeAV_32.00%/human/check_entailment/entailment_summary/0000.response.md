Reasoning:  
The program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost to travel between two cities, given the cities are located on a number line and the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin, while the cost of traveling to any other city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the list of city coordinates `cities`, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then reads each query and processes it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is intended to determine the cost of traveling to the closest city for each city in the list.
   - The function initializes `prog_cities` with `n-1` elements, each set to 0.
   - It iterates through the cities and calculates the distance to the previous and next city.
   - If the distance to the next city is less than the distance to the previous city, it sets the cost to 1 (since the next city is the closest).
   - Otherwise, it sets the cost to the distance to the next city.

3. **Prefix Sum Arrays:**
   - The program creates two prefix sum arrays, `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`, to store the cumulative cost of traveling to the closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - These arrays are used to quickly compute the minimum cost for each query.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the starting city `a` is less than the destination city `b`.
   - If `a < b`, it uses the forward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.
   - If `a > b`, it uses the backward prefix sum array to calculate the cost.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Distance Calculation in `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the distance to the next city. It should be `abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])` instead of `abs(forward - cities[i])`.
  - Similarly, the distance to the previous city should be `abs(cities[i] - cities[i - 1])` instead of `abs(cities[i] - back)`.
  - The function should also handle the case where `i` is the last city (i.e., `i == n-1`), where the forward distance is not defined.

- **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation:**
  - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are not correctly calculated. The function `func_1` should return the correct distances to the closest city, and the prefix sum should be based on these distances.

### Corrected Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if i == 0:
            back = -99999999
        else:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        if i == n - 1:
            forward = 99999999
        else:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(cities[i + 1] - cities[i])
    return prog_cities
```

### Correctness:
Given the issues identified in the function `func_1` and the prefix sum calculation, the program is **incorrect** as it does not correctly compute the minimum cost for traveling between cities.

Correctness: **False**
