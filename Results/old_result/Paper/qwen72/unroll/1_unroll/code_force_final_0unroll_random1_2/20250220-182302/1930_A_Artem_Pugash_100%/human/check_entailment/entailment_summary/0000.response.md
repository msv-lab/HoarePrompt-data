Reasoning:  
The problem requires us to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two integers from the list and adding the minimum of the two to the score. The key insight is that to maximize the score, we should always pair the smallest available integer with the next smallest available integer. This ensures that the minimum value added to the score is as large as possible in each step.

The provided program sorts the list of integers and then iterates over the sorted list, adding every second element (starting from the first) to the score. This approach works because, in a sorted list, the smallest elements are always paired with the next smallest elements. For example, if the sorted list is `[a1, a2, a3, a4, ..., a(2n-1), a(2n)]`, the pairs will be `(a1, a2)`, `(a3, a4)`, ..., `(a(2n-1), a(2n)`, and the score will be `a1 + a3 + a5 + ... + a(2n-1)`.

This approach ensures that we are always adding the smaller of the two paired elements to the score, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly processes the input, sorts the list, and calculates the score as described. The output for the example test cases matches the expected results, further confirming the correctness of the program.
