You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to take two positive integers `n` and `m` as inputs, where 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function should handle multiple test cases, each with a different pair of `n` and `m`, and the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: The loop has executed `t` iterations, where `t` is the number of test cases. For each test case, the loop reads a pair of integers `n` and `m`, and calculates the value of `ans` based on the provided logic. After all iterations, the final values of `t`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, but the variable `ans` will have been printed for each test case, and the variable `count` will have been incremented to `m + 1` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a pair of positive integers `n` and `m` and calculates a value `ans` based on a specific algorithm. The function then prints the value of `ans` for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the final state includes the printed results for each test case, with the variables `t`, `n`, and `m` remaining unchanged.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program does not correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the logic used to count the valid pairs (a, b) is flawed. The program initializes `ans` to `n` and then iterates over `count` from 2 to `m`, which is not the correct approach to count the valid pairs.

The problem description requires that for each pair (a, b), the sum `a + b` must be a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The program does not correctly implement this condition. For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `m = 5`. The valid pairs should be (1,1), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), but the program will not correctly count these pairs.

The program's logic for updating `ans` and the conditions within the loop are not aligned with the problem's requirements, leading to incorrect results for many test cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
