Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 2·10^4), `func` is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5) representing the number of houses, and a string `a` of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident's preference to live on the left side and '1' indicates a preference to live on the right side. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.**
