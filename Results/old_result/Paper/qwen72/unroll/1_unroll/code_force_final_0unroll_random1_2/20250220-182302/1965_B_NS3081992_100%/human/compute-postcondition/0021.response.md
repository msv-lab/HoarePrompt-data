Postcondition: **`n` and `k` remain unchanged, `b` is the binary representation of `n` as a string without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of the string `b`. If `k == 1`, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2 to 512 (up to 2^9). Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^(lk-2) followed by the value `k - 1 - sum(ans)`, and then `k + 1`, `2 * k + 1`, and the powers of 2 from 2^lk to 2^(l-1), where `bk` is the binary representation of `k` as a string without the '0b' prefix and `lk` is the length of the string `bk`.**
