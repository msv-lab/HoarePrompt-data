The function reads an integer `t` from the input, indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `a` from the input. It then counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0' (stored in `cut1`) and from '0' to '1' (stored in `cut0`) in the string `a`. If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it prints `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`. The function does not return any value, and it does not modify the initial binary string `s` or the integer `t`.
