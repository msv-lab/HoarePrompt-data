You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, p_i is a list of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: The value of `t` is unchanged, and for each test case, the output is the sum of the number of odd values among the first three elements of `p` (which can be 0 or 3) and the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list `p` of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) from user input. The function then calculates and prints the sum of the number of odd values among the first three elements of `p` (which can be 0 or 3) and the integer division of the sum of all elements in `p` by 2. The value of `t` remains unchanged after the function execution.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
   - The sequence consists of integers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 3s, and the total number of 2s and 4s are all even.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers to make the XOR zero as often as possible.
   - Removing a number changes the parity (odd/even) of the count of that number.
   - If the counts of 1s, 3s, and the total of 2s and 4s are all even, the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.
   - If any of these counts is odd, the XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then processes these counts to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

5. **Key Steps in the Program:**
   - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This step converts each count to the largest even number less than or equal to it. This is because removing an even number of any type of number does not change the parity of the total count.
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`: This checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, Bob wins once before any removals.
   - `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)`: This prints the number of times Bob can win. The `sum(p) // 2` part calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even, which is the number of times Bob can win.

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the initial condition where Bob wins if all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even, which is the number of times Bob can win.
   - The logic of converting each count to the largest even number and then summing the pairs is correct for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description and constraints.
