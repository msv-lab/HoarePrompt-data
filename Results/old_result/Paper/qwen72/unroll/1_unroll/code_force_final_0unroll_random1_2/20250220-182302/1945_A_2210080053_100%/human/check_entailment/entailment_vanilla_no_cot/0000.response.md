Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly handle the constraints and logic required to solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The line `b += c` adds all universals to the number of extroverts. This is incorrect because universals can be used to fill in for introverts or extroverts, but they should not be directly added to the extroverts without considering their flexibility.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Tents:**
   - The line `print((a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3])` is attempting to calculate the number of tents, but it is not correctly handling the logic for ensuring that all extroverts can be accommodated in groups of three.
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` is not a valid way to calculate the number of tents. The `--` operator is redundant and does not make sense in this context.
   - The condition `c < b % 3` is checking if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots for extroverts, but it is not correctly implemented.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve this problem, you need to:

1. **Accommodate Introverts:**
   - Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of tents needed for introverts is `a`.

2. **Accommodate Extroverts:**
   - Each extrovert needs to be in a tent with exactly two others. If there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots, it is impossible to accommodate all extroverts, and you should output `-1`.

3. **Accommodate Universals:**
   - Universals can be used to fill in for introverts or extroverts. After accommodating introverts and extroverts, the remaining universals can be placed in any tent configuration.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        a = int(data[index])
        b = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        # Introverts need their own tents
        tents = a
        
        # Each extrovert needs a tent with exactly 2 others
        if b * 3 > c + a:
            results.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Use universals to fill the tents for extroverts
        c -= min(c, b * 2)
        tents += b
        
        # Remaining universals can be placed in any tent configuration
        tents += (c + 2) // 3
        
        results.append(tents)
    
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

# Example usage
# func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of integers.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of tents needed for introverts (`a`).
   - It checks if there are enough universals and introverts to accommodate all extroverts. If not, it outputs `-1`.
   - It uses universals to fill the tents for extroverts, reducing the number of available universals.
   - It calculates the number of tents needed for the remaining universals.

3. **Output:**
   - The program collects the results for all test cases and prints them at the end.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and produce the expected output.
