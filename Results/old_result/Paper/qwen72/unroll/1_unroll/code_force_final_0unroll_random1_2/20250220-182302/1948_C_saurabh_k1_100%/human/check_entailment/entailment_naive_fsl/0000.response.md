Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the correct movement logic for the robot, especially the requirement that the robot must move along the arrow in the current cell after making its own move. Here is a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
1
4
><<<
><>>
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
No
```

In this case, the robot can reach the cell (2, 4) with the following path:
1. Start at (1, 1)
2. Move right to (1, 2) (robot's move)
3. Move left to (1, 1) (arrow move)
4. Move down to (2, 1) (robot's move)
5. Move right to (2, 2) (arrow move)
6. Move right to (2, 3) (robot's move)
7. Move right to (2, 4) (arrow move)

The program incorrectly prints "No" because it does not properly simulate the robot's movement and the arrow's direction.
