Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements in the array `a` by performing a specific operation no more than 500,000 times.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray, computing its MEX, and setting all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(a, l, r, ops)`**:
     - This function is designed to perform the operation on a subarray `a[l:r+1]` and append the operation to `ops`.
     - If `l == r` and `a[l] != 0`, it sets `a[l]` to 0 and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`.
     - If `l != r` and `a[l] != r - l + 1`, it sets all elements in the subarray `a[l:r+1]` to `r - l + 1` and appends `(l, r)` to `ops`.
     - This function is recursive and is intended to maximize the sum of the subarray by setting elements to the MEX value.

   - **`func_2(a)`**:
     - This function initializes `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`.
     - It then returns the sum of the modified array `a`, the number of operations performed, and the list of operations.
     - However, there is a critical issue: the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called without passing the necessary arguments `a` and `ops`.

   - **`recursive_maximize_sum(l, r)`**:
     - This function is designed to recursively maximize the sum of the subarray `a[l:r+1]`.
     - It checks if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to the square of its length. If so, it calls `func_1` to set the subarray to the MEX value.
     - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively processes the left and right subarrays around this maximum element.
     - The function appends the operation `(l, r)` to `ops` when the subarray is modified.

   - **`func_3()`**:
     - This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.
     - It correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem.

3. **Issues**:
   - The primary issue is in `func_2(a)`, where `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)` is called without passing `a` and `ops` as arguments. This will result in a `NameError` because `a` and `ops` are not defined in the scope of `recursive_maximize_sum`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - Due to the missing arguments in the call to `recursive_maximize_sum`, the program will not run correctly and will not produce the expected output.
   - If this issue were fixed, the program would likely meet the problem requirements, as the logic in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum` appears to be designed to maximize the sum by setting elements to the MEX value.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect due to the missing arguments in the call to `recursive_maximize_sum`.

Correctness: **False**
