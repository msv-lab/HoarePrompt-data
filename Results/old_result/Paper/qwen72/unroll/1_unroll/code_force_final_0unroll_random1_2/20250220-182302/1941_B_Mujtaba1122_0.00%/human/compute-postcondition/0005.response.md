The code snippet provided is a simple `print` statement that outputs the string `'NO'`. The precondition describes the state of a list and the return value of a function `func_1(list, n)`, but these details do not affect the output of the `print` statement, as the statement itself does not reference any variables or objects from the precondition.

Output: **NO**
