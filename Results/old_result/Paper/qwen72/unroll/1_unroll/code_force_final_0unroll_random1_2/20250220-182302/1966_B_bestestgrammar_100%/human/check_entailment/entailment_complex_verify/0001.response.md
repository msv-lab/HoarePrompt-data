### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads the grid itself, storing each row as a string in the list `gr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program starts by assuming that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color, setting `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Edge Case Check:**
   - The program checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) of the grid are different colors.
   - If they are different, it proceeds to check if there are any adjacent squares in the top row or bottom row, or in the leftmost column or rightmost column, that are different colors.
   - If all adjacent squares in the top row and bottom row are the same, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - Similarly, if all adjacent squares in the leftmost column and rightmost column are the same, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.

4. **Logic Analysis:**
   - The key insight is that if the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, the only way to make the entire grid the same color is if there is at least one row or column that has a mix of colors.
   - The program's logic is based on the idea that if the top and bottom rows or the left and right columns are uniform (all the same color), it is impossible to change the color of the entire grid to a single color using the given operations.
   - However, the program does not consider the possibility that the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and performing the operation, which is a more general case.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program fails to handle the general case where the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and performing the operation.
   - For example, consider a 3x3 grid:
     ```
     W B W
     B W B
     W B W
     ```
     This grid can be made uniform by selecting the top-left and bottom-right corners (both 'W') and performing the operation, but the program would incorrectly output 'NO' because the top and bottom rows, and the left and right columns, are uniform.

6. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the first test case (2x1 grid with 'W' and 'B'), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.
   - For the second test case (6x6 grid), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform as shown in the problem description.
   - For the third and fourth test cases (1x1 and 2x2 uniform grids), the program correctly outputs 'YES'.
   - For the fifth test case (3x4 grid with a checkerboard pattern), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform.
   - For the sixth test case (4x2 grid with two uniform rows), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.
   - For the seventh test case (4x4 grid), the program correctly outputs 'YES' because the grid can be made uniform.
   - For the eighth test case (1x5 grid with 'WBBWB'), the program correctly outputs 'NO' because the grid cannot be made uniform.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program is not fully correct because it only checks specific edge cases and does not handle the general case where the grid can be made uniform by selecting any two squares of the same color and performing the operation. Therefore, the program may fail for some valid inputs where the grid can be made uniform but does not meet the specific edge case conditions.

Final: **False**
