### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array `a` equal to zero by performing a specific operation multiple times.
   - The operation involves selecting an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n - 1`) and decrementing `a[i-1]` by 1, `a[i]` by 2, and `a[i+1]` by 1.
   - The goal is to check if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - `func_1(list, n)` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - This function is correct for its intended purpose.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - `func_2(list, n)` attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to `n-2` (i.e., `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it performs the operation while `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - The operation is performed by decrementing `list[i-1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`, `list[i]` by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i+1]` by `1 * list[i-1]`.

4. **Issues in Function 2**:
   - The operation logic is incorrect. The decrement values should be fixed to 1, 2, and 1, respectively, not scaled by `list[i-1]`.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1` should be `list[i] > 0` to ensure the operation can be applied even when `list[i]` is 1.
   - The function does not handle cases where the array cannot be reduced to all zeros correctly. It should check if the array can be reduced to all zeros without leaving any negative values.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code states that after the while loop, `list[0] to list[n-3]` are all 0, and `list[n-2] to the end of the list remain unchanged. This is incorrect because the while loop does not guarantee that the entire array will be reduced to zero.
   - The while loop condition `list[i] > 1` and the decrement logic `1 * list[i-1]` are both flawed, leading to incorrect behavior.

6. **Correct Implementation**:
   - The correct implementation should check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4 (since each operation reduces the sum by 4).
   - Additionally, the function should ensure that the array can be reduced to all zeros without any element becoming negative during the process.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the issues identified in `func_2`, the program is **incorrect**. The original assessment is accurate in identifying the flaws in the logic and the incorrect implementation of the operation.

Final: **False** (The given program is incorrect and needs to be fixed as shown in the corrected program above.)
