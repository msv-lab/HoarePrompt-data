Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly compute the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement. The program sorts the array and then prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the correct approach. The correct approach should involve summing the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array to maximize the beauty. The example provided in the original assessment clearly demonstrates that the program's output is incorrect for the given input. The corrected version of the program, which sums the differences between consecutive elements, is the correct way to solve the problem.

Final: **False**
