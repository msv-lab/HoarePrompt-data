Functionality: ** The function reads a series of test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position for Kirill (`m`), and two lists of integers (`a` and `b`) representing the costs to bribe people. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` and stores these costs in a list `custos`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each cost in `custos` exactly once, in the order they were calculated. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
