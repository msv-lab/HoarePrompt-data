### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` which represent the final destination, the number of known points, and the number of queries, respectively.
   - It then reads the lists `a` and `b` which contain the positions and times of the known points, respectively.
   - The lists `ad` and `bd` are initialized to store the differences in positions and times between consecutive known points. This is necessary to calculate the speed between these points.

2. **Speed Calculation:**
   - The list `v` is initialized to store the speed between consecutive known points. The speed is calculated as the difference in positions divided by the difference in times (`ad[i] / bd[i]`).

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program reads the distance `ql` and uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the index `s` of the first known point that is greater than or equal to `ql`.
   - If the query distance `ql` exactly matches a known point `a[s]`, the program directly prints the corresponding time `b[s]`.
   - If `ql` does not match a known point, the program calculates the time to reach `ql` by:
     - Subtracting the position of the previous known point `a[s-1]` from `ql` to get the remaining distance.
     - Adding the time taken to reach the previous known point `b[s-1]` to the time taken to travel the remaining distance at the speed between the previous and current known points (`bd[s] * ql / ad[s]`).
   - The result is then printed, rounded down to the nearest integer.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `ql` is exactly at a known point.
   - It also handles the case where `ql` is between two known points by correctly calculating the time based on the speed between those points.

5. **Efficiency:**
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) ensures that the program efficiently finds the correct segment for each query, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.

### Correctness:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the calculations for the time taken to reach each query point are accurate. The use of binary search ensures that the solution is efficient even for large inputs.

Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
