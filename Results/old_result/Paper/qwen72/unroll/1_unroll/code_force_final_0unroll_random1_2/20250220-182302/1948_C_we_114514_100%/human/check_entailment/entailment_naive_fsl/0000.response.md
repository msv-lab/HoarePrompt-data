Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the robot can move up or down in the grid. The function `func_1` only checks the horizontal movements and does not consider the possibility of the robot moving vertically between the two rows. For example, if the input is:

```
4
4
><><
><><
```

The robot can move from (1,1) to (2,1) to (2,2) to (1,2) to (1,3) to (2,3) to (2,4). However, the current implementation of `func_1` would return 'No' for this case because it only checks the conditions for moving right and does not account for moving down and then right again. This makes the program incorrect for the given problem description.
