### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves placing rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The computer mirrors your moves, placing a black rook at the transposed position of your white rook, unless the move is on the diagonal (where \( r = c \)).
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board such that no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: There is only one way to place a single rook on a \( 1 \times 1 \) board.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: There are three ways to place rooks on a \( 2 \times 2 \) board (one white and one black rook, or two white rooks, or two black rooks).
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`: This relation accounts for the number of ways to place rooks on an \( i \times i \) board by considering the placement of rooks on the previous rows and columns.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the board `n` and the number of initial moves `k`.
   - It then reads the initial moves and adds the positions to a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The program computes the number of valid positions left on the board by subtracting the size of `invalid` from `n`.
   - Finally, it prints the result `dp[n - len(invalid)]` for each test case.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` precomputes the `dp` array up to `n` using the recurrence relation.
   - The precomputation is done once at the beginning, and the results are stored in the `dp` array for quick access during the test cases.

5. **Edge Cases and Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where `n - len(invalid)` might be 0 or 1.
   - The use of `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` ensures that if there are no valid positions left, the result is 1 (since there is exactly one configuration: no rooks).

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The modulo operation is correctly applied in the recurrence relation to ensure that the results do not overflow and are within the required range.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It precomputes the number of valid configurations for different board sizes and uses this precomputed data to efficiently solve each test case. The logic for handling invalid positions and the modulo operation is also correct.
