Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided has a logical error in the `func_2` function. Specifically, the while loop condition and the operations inside the loop are incorrect. The program attempts to modify the elements of the array by subtracting multiples of `list[i-1]` from the elements at indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1`. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the operation described in the problem, which should subtract 1 from `a_{i-1}`, 2 from `a_i`, and 1 from `a_{i+1}`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Input:
```
3
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

Expected Output:
```
YES
```

Actual Output:
```
NO
```

The program incorrectly modifies the array elements and does not achieve the desired result. For example, the first iteration of the loop might set `list[i-1]` to a negative value, which is not allowed according to the problem constraints. Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the array can be reduced to all zeros using the specified operations.
