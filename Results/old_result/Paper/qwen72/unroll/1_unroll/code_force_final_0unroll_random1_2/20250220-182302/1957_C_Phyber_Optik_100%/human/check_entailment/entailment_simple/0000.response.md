Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied by rooks.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**:
   - The program initializes a DP array `dp` with a size of 300007, filled with -1.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the argument 300000 to precompute the DP values up to 300000.
   - The DP array is used to store the number of possible configurations for a given number of free rows/columns.

3. **DP Computation**:
   - The function `func_1` sets the base cases: `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - For each `i` from 3 to `n`, it computes `dp[i]` using the formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`.
   - This formula is derived from the problem of placing rooks on a chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The term `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for the new configurations that can be formed by placing a rook in a new row and column, while `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where no new rook is placed.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the number of free rows/columns by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
   - It then prints the value `dp[n - len(invalid)]` modulo 1000000007.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n - len(invalid)` is 0 by printing `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`, ensuring that at least one configuration (an empty board) is counted.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The DP array is precomputed up to 300000, which is efficient given the constraints.
   - The use of a set `invalid` ensures that the operations to add and check elements are efficient (O(1) on average).

7. **Correctness of the DP Formula**:
   - The formula used in the DP computation is correct for the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on a chessboard. It correctly accounts for the different ways to place rooks in new rows and columns.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
