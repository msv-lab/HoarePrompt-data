Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The logic in the given program is flawed. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **First Condition (`if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0`)**:
   - This condition checks if both dimensions are even. If both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle. This part is correct.

2. **Second Condition (`elif (a - b == -a, a) or (b - a == -b, b)`)**:
   - This condition is incorrect. The expressions `(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)` are tuples, and the `or` operator will evaluate them as truthy or falsy based on the tuple itself, not the individual conditions. This condition will never be true and is logically incorrect.

3. **Third Condition (`elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`)**:
   - This condition is also incorrect. The expression `(a - b) % 2` will always be either 0 or 1 (or -1 if `a - b` is negative). The condition `(a - b) % 2 > 0` is equivalent to checking if `a - b` is odd, and `(a - b) % 2 < 0` is never true because the result of a modulo operation is non-negative. This condition will always be true if `a - b` is odd, which is not the correct logic.

4. **Fourth Condition (`else`)**:
   - This condition will only be reached if the previous conditions are false. However, the previous conditions are not correctly formulated, leading to incorrect results.

The correct logic should be:
- If either `a` or `b` is even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and form a new rectangle.
- If both `a` and `b` are odd, Bob cannot form a new rectangle because cutting an odd-length side will always result in two smaller rectangles that cannot form a new rectangle different from the original.

Here is the corrected program:

```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This program correctly checks if either dimension is even and prints "yes" if so, and "no" otherwise.
