The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer. The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 for each iteration of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4.
- `i` is not explicitly initialized before the loop, but it will be initialized to 0 by the `range(t)` function.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `t` is at least 1 and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `i` is 0**
