### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - The computer mirrors your moves, placing a black rook at the mirrored position of your white rook.
   - The goal is to count the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` precomputes the number of valid configurations for a given number of rows (or columns) that are not yet occupied by rooks.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for an \( i \times i \) board where no two rooks attack each other.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one configuration (one rook).
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations (one rook in each cell of a 2x2 board, or two rooks in non-attacking positions).
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`:
       - `dp[i - 1]`: Placing one rook in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.
       - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]`: Placing two rooks in non-attacking positions in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, we read the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - We then read the \( k \) moves and add the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied.
   - The number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) rows (or columns) is given by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 0, there are no valid moves left, and the number of configurations is 1 (the current state).
   - If \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 1, there is only one valid configuration (one rook).

5. **Precomputation**:
   - The `func_1` function precomputes the DP values up to 300,000, which is sufficient given the constraints.
   - This ensures that the DP values are available for any test case within the given limits.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, which is a common practice in competitive programming.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Code:

- **State of the program right before the function call**:
  - `n` is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5 \).
  - The function `func_1` is called with `n = 300000` to precompute the DP values up to this limit.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly initializes `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` with the base cases.
  - The loop from 3 to `n` correctly computes the DP values using the recurrence relation.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the values do not overflow.

- **Main Loop**:
  - For each test case, the program reads `n` and `k`.
  - It initializes an empty set `invalid` to keep track of occupied rows and columns.
  - For each of the \( k \) moves, it adds the row and column indices to `invalid`.
  - The program then prints the number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) rows (or columns) using `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Recurrence Relation**:
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is correct. It accounts for the configurations where:
    - One rook is placed in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.
    - Two rooks are placed in non-attacking positions in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.

- **Handling of Invalid Moves**:
  - The program correctly identifies and tracks invalid positions using a set `invalid`.
  - It correctly computes the number of remaining valid positions as \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program handles the edge cases where \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 0 or 1 by using `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`.

### Final Evaluation:

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for precomputing the DP values and calculating the final configurations is sound.

Final: **True**
