Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", and ")", with a maximum length of 500,000. It returns a string that is a rearranged version of `s` based on the balance of parentheses at each position. The returned string maintains the same characters as `s` but may have a different order, ensuring that the balance of parentheses is preserved. **
