The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, both of which are positive integers with the constraint 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6. The function also handles multiple test cases, where the number of test cases `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. The sum of all `n` values and the sum of all `m` values across all test cases do not exceed 2 * 10^6.

The function returns a result based on the input values `n` and `m` for each test case. However, the specific output for each case is not provided in the constraints. Assuming the function returns a result for each test case, the overall functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` for each of up to 10^4 test cases, with the constraints 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6 and the sum of all `n` and `m` values across all test cases not exceeding 2 * 10^6. It returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `m`.**
