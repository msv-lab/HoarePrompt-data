You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func_1` is expected to handle multiple test cases. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5, and `a` is a list of integers of length `n` where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5, and there is at least one valid permutation `p` for each test case.

    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    mex = []
    minn = 0
    used = {}

        if arr[i] > 0:
            mex.append(minn)
            used[minn] = True

            used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
        
    #State: Output State: `mex` is a list of integers where each element is either the current `minn` value (if `arr[i]` is positive) or the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `minn` (if `arr[i]` is non-positive). `minn` is the smallest non-negative integer that has not been added to the `used` dictionary. `used` is a dictionary containing all the integers that have been added to `mex` as keys, with their values set to `True`.
    for itm in mex:
        print(itm, end=' ')
        
    #State: The elements of `mex` are printed in the order they appear in the list, separated by spaces. The values of `minn` and `used` remain unchanged.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a[i]` is defined as `MEX(p[1], p[2], ..., p[i]) - p[i]`.
   - The goal is to reconstruct a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to `n-1` that satisfies the given `a`.

2. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `a`.

3. **Reconstruction of Permutation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `mex` to store the reconstructed permutation.
   - It also initializes a variable `minn` to 0, which will keep track of the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `used` is used to keep track of the elements that have already been used in the permutation.

4. **Processing Each Element of `a`:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`:
     - If `arr[i]` is greater than 0, it means the MEX value is greater than `p[i]`. The program appends `minn` to `mex` and marks `minn` as used. It then increments `minn` until it finds the next unused value.
     - If `arr[i]` is less than or equal to 0, it means the MEX value is less than or equal to `p[i]`. The program calculates `p[i]` as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to `mex`. It then marks this value as used.

5. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements of `a`, the program prints the reconstructed permutation `mex`.

6. **Verification:**
   - The logic for reconstructing the permutation seems to follow the problem's constraints and definitions correctly.
   - The program correctly handles the MEX calculation and the used elements.
   - The program ensures that the permutation is valid by using a dictionary to keep track of used elements and incrementing `minn` appropriately.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program should handle the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly, as it will simply output the only possible permutation `[0]`.
   - The program should also handle larger values of `n` and multiple test cases correctly.

8. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program appears to follow the correct logic and should produce a valid permutation for the given `a` array.

Correctness: **True**
