Reasoning:

The program provided is incorrect because it does not perform the decoding as described in the problem statement. The problem requires us to decode a string `b` back to the original string `s` by reversing the encoding process, which involves replacing each character in `b` with its symmetric character from the auxiliary string `r`. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement this decoding process.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Use of `unique_chars` List**:
   - The function `func_1` creates a sorted list of unique characters from the input string `s` (which is actually the encoded string `b`).
   - It then attempts to replace each character in `s` with the last character in `unique_chars`, decrementing `j` each time. This does not correctly implement the symmetric replacement required for decoding.

2. **Incorrect Insertions**:
   - The function also inserts characters into `unique_chars` if they are not already present, which is not part of the decoding process described in the problem. This step is unnecessary and incorrect.

3. **Final Return Value**:
   - The function returns the concatenation of `unique_chars`, which is not the original string `s` but rather a sorted list of unique characters from `s` (or `b`).

To correctly decode the string, the function should:
- Construct the auxiliary string `r` from the unique characters in `b` sorted in alphabetical order.
- Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric character.
- Use this mapping to replace each character in `b` with its corresponding character in `r`.

Given these issues, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
