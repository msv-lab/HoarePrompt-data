Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a grid represented as a list of strings. Each string in the grid represents a row and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and, for each test case, reads the grid dimensions `n` and `m`, and the grid itself. It then checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners of the grid are the same character. If they are different, it further checks if any row or column has all the same characters. If any row or column has all the same characters, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, the function ends, and the variable `t` remains unchanged, while the variables `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` reflect the state of the last test case processed. **
