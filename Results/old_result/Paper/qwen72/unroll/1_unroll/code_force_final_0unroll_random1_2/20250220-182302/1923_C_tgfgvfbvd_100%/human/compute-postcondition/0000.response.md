The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range of the number of test cases. For the loop to execute, the range must be greater than 0, which means there must be at least one test case. The state of the function `func` and the constraints on `c`, `n`, `q`, and the queries are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted directly for the loop to execute.

State: **`_` iterates over a range that must be greater than 0 (i.e., there must be at least one test case)**
