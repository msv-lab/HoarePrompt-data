The function `func` is expected to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`, and a list of `n-1` integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array `x`. The number of test cases `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.
