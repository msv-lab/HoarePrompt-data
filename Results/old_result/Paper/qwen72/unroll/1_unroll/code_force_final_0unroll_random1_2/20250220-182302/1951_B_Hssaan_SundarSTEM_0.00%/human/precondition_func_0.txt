The function `func` is incomplete and does not match the problem description. The correct function definition should be `def max_wins(n, k, ratings):` where `n` is the number of cows, `k` is the index of your cow, and `ratings` is a list of integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows. `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `ratings` is a list of `n` distinct integers where 1 ≤ ratings[i] ≤ 10^9.
