### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires coloring the minimum number of cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals (both main and anti-diagonals) contain at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Analyzing the Solution:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It then determines the minimum number of cells to color based on the value of \( k \).

3. **Breaking Down the Conditions:**
   - **Condition 1: \( k \leq 4n - 4 \)**
     - If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 4n - 4 \), the program prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \).
     - This condition is based on the observation that each colored cell can cover at most 2 diagonals (one main and one anti-diagonal).
     - Therefore, to cover \( k \) diagonals, we need at least \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \) cells.
     - **Example:**
       - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 4 \), \( \lceil 4 / 2 \rceil = 2 \). This is correct because 2 cells can cover 4 diagonals.
       - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \), \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \). This is correct because 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.
       - For \( n = 4 \) and \( k = 7 \), \( \lceil 7 / 2 \rceil = 4 \). This is correct because 4 cells can cover 7 diagonals.
       - For \( n = 7 \) and \( k = 11 \), \( \lceil 11 / 2 \rceil = 6 \). This is correct because 6 cells can cover 11 diagonals.
       - For \( n = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \), \( \lceil 3 / 2 \rceil = 2 \). This is correct because 2 cells can cover 3 diagonals.

   - **Condition 2: \( k = 4n - 3 \)**
     - If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 3 \), the program prints \( 2n - 1 \).
     - This condition is based on the fact that to cover \( 4n - 3 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells in one row and one column, which results in \( 2n - 1 \) cells being colored.
     - **Example:**
       - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 9 \), \( 2n - 1 = 5 \). This is correct because 5 cells are needed to cover 9 diagonals.

   - **Condition 3: \( k = 4n - 2 \)**
     - If \( k \) is exactly \( 4n - 2 \), the program prints \( 2n \).
     - This condition is based on the fact that to cover all \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, we need to color all cells in one row and one column, plus one additional cell to ensure all diagonals are covered, which results in \( 2n \) cells being colored.
     - **Example:**
       - For \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), \( 2n = 6 \). This is correct because 6 cells are needed to cover all 10 diagonals.

4. **Verification:**
   - The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color is sound.
   - The conditions and the calculations are logically consistent and match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all the given test cases and the logic for determining the minimum number of cells to color is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
