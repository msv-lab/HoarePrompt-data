### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding the year in which the n-th sign will occur, given the periodicities of the signs.
   - Each sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the signs must occur sequentially.
   - The year for the i-th sign is the smallest year greater than the previous sign's year that is a multiple of `a_i`.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with a number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a`.
   - The output should be the year in which the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`.
   - Finally, it prints the year for each test case.

4. **Formula Analysis**:
   - The formula `year += year % ai or ai` is intended to find the next multiple of `ai` after the current year `year`.
   - However, this formula is incorrect:
     - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is already a multiple of `ai`, and adding `ai` would skip to the next multiple, which is not what we want.
     - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and adding the remainder `year % ai` would not necessarily give the next multiple of `ai`.

5. **Correct Formula**:
   - The correct formula to find the next multiple of `ai` after the current year `year` is:
     - `next_year = year + (ai - (year % ai)) if year % ai != 0 else year + ai`
   - This formula ensures that we add the smallest number to `year` to make it a multiple of `ai`.

6. **Verification with Examples**:
   - For the input `3 2 4 5 9 18`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - First sign: `year = 0 + 3 = 3`.
     - Second sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 2 = 1`).
     - Third sign: `year = 4 + 4 = 8` (since `4 % 4 = 0`).
     - Fourth sign: `year = 8 + 2 = 10` (since `8 % 5 = 3`).
     - Fifth sign: `year = 10 + 8 = 18` (since `10 % 9 = 1`).
     - Sixth sign: `year = 18 + 18 = 36` (since `18 % 18 = 0`).
   - For the input `1 2 3 4 5`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - First sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`.
     - Second sign: `year = 1 + 1 = 2` (since `1 % 2 = 1`).
     - Third sign: `year = 2 + 1 = 3` (since `2 % 3 = 2`).
     - Fourth sign: `year = 3 + 1 = 4` (since `3 % 4 = 3`).
     - Fifth sign: `year = 4 + 1 = 5` (since `4 % 5 = 4`).
   - For the input `1 1 1 1 1`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - Each sign: `year = 0 + 1 = 1`, `year = 1 + 1 = 2`, `year = 2 + 1 = 3`, `year = 3 + 1 = 4`, `year = 4 + 1 = 5`.
   - For the input `50 30 711 200 503 1006`:
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - First sign: `year = 0 + 50 = 50`.
     - Second sign: `year = 50 + 10 = 60` (since `50 % 30 = 20`).
     - Third sign: `year = 60 + 651 = 711` (since `60 % 711 = 60`).
     - Fourth sign: `year = 711 + 129 = 840` (since `711 % 200 = 111`).
     - Fifth sign: `year = 840 + 163 = 1003` (since `840 % 503 = 337`).
     - Sixth sign: `year = 1003 + 1009 = 2012` (since `1003 % 1006 = 1`).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is incorrect because the formula `year += year % ai or ai` does not correctly find the next multiple of `ai` after the current year `year`.
   - The correct formula should be `year += (ai - (year % ai)) if year % ai != 0 else ai`.
