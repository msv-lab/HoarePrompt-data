The function `func` does not explicitly list its parameters in the provided function signature. However, based on the parameter constraints and relationships, it is clear that the function is intended to accept a parameter `t` which is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and for each test case, a list `p_i` of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence. The function should return a result based on these inputs, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints.

Given the context, we can infer that the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each defined by a list `p_i` of four integers, and return a result for each test case. However, without further details on the output, we can only describe the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, a list `p_i` of four integers (0 <= p_i <= 200) representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours in a sequence.**
