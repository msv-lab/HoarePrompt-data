The only object in the loop head is the variable `_`, which is used to iterate over the range. The loop will execute based on the value provided by `int(input())`, which is the number of test cases `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

State: **`t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), `_` is 0**
