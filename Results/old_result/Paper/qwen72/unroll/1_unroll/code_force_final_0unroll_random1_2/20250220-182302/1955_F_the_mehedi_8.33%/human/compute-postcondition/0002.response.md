The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might internally use or process a sequence of four integers `p_i` and an integer `t`. The integer `t` is such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, and each of the four integers `p_i` in the sequence is such that 0 <= p_i <= 200. The function returns a value based on these internal parameters, but the specific return value or condition is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function processes a sequence of four integers `p_i` (where 0 <= p_i <= 200) and an integer `t` (where 1 <= t <= 10^4) internally and returns a value based on these parameters.**
