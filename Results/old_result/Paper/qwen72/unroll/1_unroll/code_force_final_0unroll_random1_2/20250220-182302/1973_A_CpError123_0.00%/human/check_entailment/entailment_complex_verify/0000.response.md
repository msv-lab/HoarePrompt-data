### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and the original assessment step by step to determine if the program is correct or not.

1. **Input and Initial State:**
   - The program takes `t` (number of test cases) and `cas_de_test` (a list of tuples containing the scores of the three players).
   - The initial state is correctly described: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) such that \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function processes each tuple `(p1, p2, p3)` in `cas_de_test` to determine the number of draws.
   - **Step 1: Calculate Total Points**
     - `total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`
     - This is correct as it sums the scores of the three players.
   - **Step 2: Check if Total Points is Even**
     - `if total_points % 2 != 0:`
     - This condition is correct because the total points must be even for the scores to be consistent with the rules of the game (each game results in either 2 points or 1 point per player in a draw).
   - **Step 3: Calculate Total Matches**
     - `total_matchs = total_points // 2`
     - This is correct as it calculates the total number of matches played based on the total points.
   - **Step 4: Check Validity of Total Matches and Maximum Score**
     - `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:`
     - This condition is indeed incorrect. The total number of matches can be greater than 3, and the maximum score `p3` can be greater than the total number of matches. For example, in the case `(0, 0, 6)`, the total points are 6, which is even, and the total number of matches is 3. However, the program incorrectly returns -1 because `p3 > total_matchs` is `True` (6 > 3). This should be a valid case where the maximum number of draws is 3 (since all games could have ended in a draw).

3. **Step 5: Calculate Number of Draws**
   - `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`
   - This formula is derived from the idea that the total points are the sum of points from wins and draws. The points from wins are `2 * (p3 - p2) + 2 * (p3 - p1)`, and the remaining points are from draws.
   - `if egalites < 0:`
   - This condition checks if the calculated number of draws is negative, which would indicate an invalid set of scores.
   - `resultats.append(egalites // 2)`
   - This correctly calculates the number of draws and appends it to the results list.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct in identifying the issue with the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:`. This condition is too restrictive and incorrectly filters out valid cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
