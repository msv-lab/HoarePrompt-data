### Reasoning:

Let's break down the function `func` and evaluate its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Card Laying Process:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `L` to keep track of the number of cards laid down in each step.
   - It uses a while loop to process the cards. In each iteration:
     - `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards or cards that are multiples of odd numbers in the current step.
     - `n` is decremented by `m` to account for the cards that have been laid down.
     - `m` is appended to the list `L`.

3. **Finding the k-th Card:**
   - The function initializes `tot` to 0 and `pow` to 1.
   - It iterates through the list `L` to find the step where the \( k \)-th card is laid down.
   - If `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`, it prints the \( k \)-th card as `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
   - `tot` is incremented by `a` to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - `pow` is multiplied by 2 to move to the next step (i.e., cards that are multiples of the next power of 2).

### Analysis:

- **Step-by-Step Calculation:**
  - The function correctly calculates the number of cards to be laid down in each step using `(n + 1) // 2`.
  - It correctly appends the number of cards to the list `L` and updates `n` accordingly.

- **Finding the k-th Card:**
  - The function correctly tracks the cumulative count of cards laid down using `tot`.
  - It correctly identifies the step where the \( k \)-th card is laid down by checking if `tot < k` and `k <= tot + a`.
  - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` is used to calculate the \( k \)-th card. This formula is derived from the fact that in each step, the cards are laid down in the order of odd multiples of the current power of 2.
