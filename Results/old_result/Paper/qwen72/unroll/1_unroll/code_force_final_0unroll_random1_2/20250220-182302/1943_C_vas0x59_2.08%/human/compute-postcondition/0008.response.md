Output State: **`n` remains the same integer value input by the user, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of the connected nodes. Each pair of integers `(u, v)` input during the loop execution has been used to append `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`, with `u` and `v` being 0-indexed. The length of each list in `u2vs` will be the number of connections (edges) that the corresponding node has. `d` is now the dictionary returned by the `bfs` function, containing the shortest path distances from node 0 to all other nodes. `previous` is a new variable that holds the second value returned by the `bfs` function, which is likely a dictionary of the parent nodes in the BFS tree. `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`. `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.**
