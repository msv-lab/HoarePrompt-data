To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the variables and objects in the loop head, which in this case are `i` and the result of `int(input())`.

1. The variable `i` is initialized by the `range` function, starting from 0.
2. The loop will execute if the result of `int(input())` is greater than 0. This is because `range(n)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0, the sequence will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer, and `i` is initialized to 0.

State: **`i` is 0, `int(input())` must be greater than 0**
