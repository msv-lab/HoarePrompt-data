The function `func_2` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is implied that the function might use or require external variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9. The output of the function is not specified, but it is expected to return some value or result based on these constraints.

Since the exact output is not provided, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints:

Functionality: **The function operates with external integer variables `t`, `a`, and `b`, where `t` is between 1 and 1000, and `a` and `b` are between 1 and 10^9. The function returns a result based on these variables, but the specific output is not defined.**
