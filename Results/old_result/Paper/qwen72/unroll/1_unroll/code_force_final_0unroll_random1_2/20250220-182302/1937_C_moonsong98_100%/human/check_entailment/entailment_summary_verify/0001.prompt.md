You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters and always returns `None`. It reads an integer `n` from the user input, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. If `n` is 2, it calls `func_2(0, 1)` and returns. Otherwise, it determines the index of the maximum element (`max_index`) and the index of the minimum element (`min_index`) in a sequence of `n` elements, which are compared using `func_1`. The function then calls `func_2(max_index, min_index)`. The final state of the program is that `max_index` is the index of the maximum element, and `min_index` is the index of the minimum element among the elements that are equal to or less than the element at `max_index`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find two indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - We can ask up to \( 3n \) queries to compare bitwise OR results of pairs of indices.
   - The permutation \( p \) is a sequence of unique integers from \( 0 \) to \( n-1 \).

2. **Initial Check for \( n = 2 \)**:
   - If \( n = 2 \), the only possible pair is \( (0, 1) \), and \( p_0 \oplus p_1 \) will always be \( 1 \), which is the maximum possible value.
   - The program correctly handles this case by directly outputting \( ! 0 1 \).

3. **Finding the Maximum Index**:
   - The program initializes `max_index` to 0.
   - It iterates through all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( p_0 \mid p_{\text{max_index}} \) with \( p_0 \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_0 \mid p_i \) is greater, it updates `max_index` to \( i \).
   - This step ensures that `max_index` is the index with the maximum value of \( p_0 \mid p_i \).

4. **Finding the Minimum Indices**:
   - The program initializes `min_indices` with the current `max_index`.
   - It iterates through all indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n-1 \) and compares \( p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_indices[0]}} \) with \( p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i \) is less, it updates `min_indices` to contain only \( i \).
   - If \( p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i \) is equal, it appends \( i \) to `min_indices`.
   - This step ensures that `min_indices` contains all indices \( i \) such that \( p_{\text{max_index}} \mid p_i \) is minimized.

5. **Selecting the Minimum Index**:
   - The program initializes `min_index` to the first element in `min_indices`.
   - It iterates through `min_indices` and compares \( p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_{\text{min_index}} \) with \( p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_i \).
   - If \( p_{\text{min_index}} \mid p_i \) is equal, it updates `min_index` to \( i \).
   - This step ensures that `min_index` is the index with the minimum value of \( p_i \) among the indices in `min_indices`.

6. **Outputting the Result**:
   - The program outputs the indices \( \text{max_index} \) and \( \text{min_index} \) as the answer.
   - The pair \( (p_{\text{max_index}}, p_{\text{min_index}}) \) should maximize the XOR value \( p_i \oplus p_j \).

7. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes \( n \) queries to find the maximum index.
   - It makes \( n \) queries to find the minimum indices.
   - It makes \( \text{len(min_indices)} \) queries to select the minimum index.
   - The total number of queries is \( n + n + \text{len(min_indices)} \), which is at most \( 3n \) since \( \text{len(min_indices)} \le n \).

### Correctness:
The program follows the correct logic to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. It handles the special case for \( n = 2 \) correctly and ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \( 3n \). Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
