Output State: **The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. Each list contains numbers from the original `numbers` list, distributed such that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`, while also ensuring that the lengths of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively.**
