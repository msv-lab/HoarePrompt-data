You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function should take three parameters: n, k, and s. n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 26, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 26, and s is a string of length m (1 <= m <= 1000) comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.

    n, k, m = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    us = set(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    win = set()
    ans = []
    ps = 0
    for i in s:
        if i in us:
            win.add(i)
            if len(win) == k:
                ans.append(i)
                ps += 1
                win.clear()
        
    #State: Output State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains the characters that were the `k`-th unique characters from `us` found in `s` in the order they appeared, `ps` is the number of times a `k`-th unique character from `us` was found in `s`.
    if (ps >= n) :
        return print('YES')
        #The program prints 'YES' and returns None.
    #State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains the characters that were the `k`-th unique characters from `us` found in `s` in the order they appeared, `ps` is the number of times a `k`-th unique character from `us` was found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`.
    print('NO')
    #This is printed: NO
    for i in us:
        if i not in win:
            return print(''.join(ans) + i + 'a' * (n - len(ans) - 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `m` remains unchanged, `s` remains unchanged, `us` remains unchanged, `win` is an empty set, `ans` contains the characters that were the `k`-th unique characters from `us` found in `s` in the order they appeared, `ps` is the number of times a `k`-th unique character from `us` was found in `s`, and `ps` is less than `n`. The loop will print a string that consists of the characters in `ans` concatenated with the first unique character from `us` that is not in `win` and then padded with `a` characters to reach a total length of `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads `n`, `k`, and `s` from user input. It processes the string `s` to find the `k`-th unique characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the function finds at least `n` such `k`-th unique characters, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If fewer than `n` such characters are found, it prints 'NO' followed by a string that consists of the characters found in `ans`, the first unique character from `us` that is not in `win`, and then padded with `a` characters to reach a total length of `n`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `k`, `m`, or `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it checks for the presence of all possible subsequences of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. Specifically, the program only checks if a window of characters in the string `s` contains all `k` unique characters and then appends the current character to the `ans` list. This approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked.

### Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
```
1
2 2 4
abab
```
**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```
**Actual Output:**
```
NO
ba
```

**Explanation:**
- The program should check if all possible strings of length 2 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets (i.e., "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences of "abab".
- The program only checks if a window of characters contains all unique characters and then appends the current character to the `ans` list. This means it only checks for the presence of "ab" and "ba" but not "aa" or "bb".
- Since "aa" and "bb" are not checked, the program incorrectly prints "NO" and a string that does not occur as a subsequence.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
