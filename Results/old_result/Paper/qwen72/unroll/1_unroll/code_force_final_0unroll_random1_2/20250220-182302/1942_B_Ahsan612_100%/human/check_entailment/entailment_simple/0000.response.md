Reasoning:

The program aims to reconstruct a permutation `p` from the array `a` based on the MEX (Minimum EXcluded value) operation. The key to solving this problem is to understand how the MEX value and the elements of `p` relate to the elements of `a`.

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Reconstruction of `p`**:
   - The program initializes an array `res` of length `n` with `None` values.
   - It also initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible value for the MEX at the start (since the MEX of an empty array is 0, and the MEX of a full array of length `n` containing all integers from 0 to `n-1` is `n`).

3. **Backward Construction**:
   - The program iterates over the array `a` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is less than the current `mex`.

4. **Output**:
   - After constructing the permutation `res`, it prints the elements of `res` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Program:

- **Correctness of the MEX Calculation**:
  - The MEX of a prefix of `p` (i.e., `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i`) is the smallest non-negative integer that is not in the prefix.
  - The program uses the relationship `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i` to reconstruct `p`.
  - By iterating in reverse, the program ensures that the MEX value is correctly updated as it processes each element of `a`.

- **Handling of `mex`**:
  - The variable `mex` is initialized to `n` and is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is smaller.
  - This ensures that `mex` always represents the correct MEX value for the current prefix of `p`.

- **Output Validation**:
  - The program prints the reconstructed permutation `res` for each test case.
  - The final state of `t` is 0 after all test cases have been processed, and the variables `n` and `ar` are reset for each test case.

### Potential Issues:
- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program should handle edge cases where `n` is 1 or 2.
  - For `n = 1`, the program should output the only possible permutation `[0]`.
  - For `n = 2`, the program should correctly handle the MEX calculation and permutation reconstruction.

- **MEX Update**:
  - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is always true because `mex - ar[i]` is always less than or equal to `mex` (since `ar[i]` is non-negative).
  - This means the `mex` update is always performed, which is correct for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and the MEX operation. It handles the input and output as specified in the problem description and ensures that the MEX value is updated correctly.

Correctness: **True**
