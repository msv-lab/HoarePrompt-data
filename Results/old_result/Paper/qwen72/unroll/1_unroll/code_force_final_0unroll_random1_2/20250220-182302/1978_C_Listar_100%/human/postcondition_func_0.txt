The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, and `k` is a non-negative integer up to 1,000,000,000,000. It returns a list `l` which is initially a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`. The function modifies `l` and `k` through a series of operations, and the final state of `l` depends on the value of `k` and the number of iterations. If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, the function returns the current state of `l`. If `k` is less than `i - 1` at any point, the function calls `func_2` and returns its result. Otherwise, it continues to modify `l` using `func_3` and decrements `k` until the loop completes. The final value of `c` is `(n // 2) + 1` if `n` is odd, or `n // 2` if `n` is even, and `k` is the remaining value after all updates.
