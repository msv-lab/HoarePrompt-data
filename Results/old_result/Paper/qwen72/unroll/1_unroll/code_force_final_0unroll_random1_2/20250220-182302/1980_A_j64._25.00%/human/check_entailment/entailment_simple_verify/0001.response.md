Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by defining `t` and `test_cases` and then calling `func_1` with these parameters. It prints the results, which is consistent with the problem description.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases`. It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case. This is correct.

3. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The function iterates over each test case using a for loop. For each test case, it unpacks the tuple `(n, m, a)` into the variables `n`, `m`, and `a`. This is correct and follows the problem description.

4. **Frequency Calculation**: The program initializes a list `freq` of length 7 to represent the frequencies of problems from 'A' to 'G'. It then iterates over the string `a` and increments the corresponding index in `freq` based on the difficulty level of each problem using `ord(prob) - ord('A')`. This mapping is correct and ensures that 'A' maps to index 0, 'B' to index 1, and so on.

5. **Calculate Missing Problems**: The program calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level by using the expression `max(0, m - f)` for each frequency `f` in `freq`. This expression correctly ensures that if there are enough problems of a certain difficulty, the result is 0; otherwise, it calculates the difference between the required number of problems `m` and the available number of problems `f`.

6. **Sum of Missing Problems**: The program sums up the missing problems for all difficulty levels and appends the result to the `results` list. This is correct and follows the problem description.

7. **Return Results**: The function returns the `results` list, which contains the number of missing problems for each test case. This is correct.

8. **Output**: The program prints the results for each test case, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given the problem description and the steps taken in the program, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems needed for each test case. The logic and implementation are sound.

Final: **True**
