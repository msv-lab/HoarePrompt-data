Functionality: ** The function `func` processes multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`. For each test case, the function prints a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z, derived from the trace provided in `a`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, and the state of the program is reset for the next function call. **
