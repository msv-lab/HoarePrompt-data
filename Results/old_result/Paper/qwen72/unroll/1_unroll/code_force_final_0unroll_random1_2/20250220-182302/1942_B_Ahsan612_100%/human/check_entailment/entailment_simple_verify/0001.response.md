### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires reconstructing a permutation `p` from an array `a` where `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The formula `p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i` is correct.
   - The MEX value for the permutation `p` must be maintained as we construct it.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible MEX value for the permutation.
   - It iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - The update condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is intended to ensure that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix of `p` up to `i`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly calculates `p_i` using the formula `p_i = mex - ar[i]`.
   - However, the update condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` is problematic. This condition is always true because `mex - ar[i]` is always less than or equal to `mex` (since `ar[i]` is an integer and `mex` is a non-negative integer).
   - Therefore, `mex` is always updated to `mex - ar[i]` in each iteration, which can lead to incorrect MEX values and, consequently, incorrect permutation elements.

5. **Correct Update Condition:**
   - The correct update condition should be `if mex > p_i` to ensure that `mex` is updated only if the new value `p_i` is less than the current `mex`.
   - This ensures that `mex` remains the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix of `p`.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - However, the incorrect update condition can cause issues with larger values of `n` and various `a_i` values, especially when `a_i` is negative.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case, but the permutation may be incorrect due to the flawed update condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the update condition for `mex` is flawed. The program does not correctly maintain the MEX value, leading to potential incorrect permutations. The correct update condition should be `if mex > p_i`.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
