### Reasoning:

1. **Input Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the input by iterating over each test case in `cas_de_test`.
   - The conditions for the total points and the number of matches are checked to ensure the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

2. **Total Points Check**:
   - The program checks if the total points (`total_points`) are even. This is correct because each game results in either 2 points (for a win/loss) or 2 points (for a draw), so the total points must be even.

3. **Total Matches Check**:
   - The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match contributes 2 points to the total.
   - It then checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` is greater than `total_matchs`. This is incorrect. The maximum number of matches is not necessarily limited to 3, and `p3` can be greater than `total_matchs` if there are draws. The correct condition should be that `p3` should not be greater than `total_matchs` because the highest scorer cannot have more points than the total number of matches.

4. **Draw Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of draws (`egalites`) as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This is incorrect. The correct formula should be `total_matchs - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)`, which simplifies to `total_points // 2 - (p3 - p2) - (p3 - p1)`.
   - The program then checks if `egalites` is negative. If it is, it appends -1 to `resultats`. This is correct because a negative number of draws is not possible.
   - Finally, it appends `egalites // 2` to `resultats`. This is incorrect because `egalites` should already represent the number of draws, and dividing by 2 is unnecessary.

### Correctness: **False**

The program has logical errors in the conditions for checking the total number of matches and in the calculation of the number of draws. Specifically, the condition `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is too restrictive and the draw calculation formula is incorrect. These issues can lead to incorrect results for some test cases.
