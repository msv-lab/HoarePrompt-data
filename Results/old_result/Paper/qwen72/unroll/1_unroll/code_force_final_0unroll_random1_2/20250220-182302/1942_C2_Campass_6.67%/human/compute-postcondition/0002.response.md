The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is truthy (i.e., not 0, not `False`, not `None`, not an empty collection, etc.), the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is assigned the first integer from the input. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be a non-zero integer.

State: **The function `func` is not properly defined to solve the problem as described. The correct function definition should be: `def func(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):`. `R` is a lambda function that maps the input split by spaces to integers. `t` is assigned the first integer from the input and `t` must be a non-zero integer.**
