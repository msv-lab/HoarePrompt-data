### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` (number of people in the queue) and `m` (the maximum allowable final position of Kirill). It then reads the lists `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`, which represent the costs for Kirill to bribe the i-th person and the costs for Kirill to pay the k-th person, respectively.

2. **Adjusting Indices**: The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from each. This is necessary because the problem description uses 1-based indexing, but Python lists use 0-based indexing. This adjustment ensures that the indices are correctly aligned.

3. **Initialization**: The program initializes `total` to 0, which will keep track of the total cost Kirill incurs, and `best` to a very large number (`10 ** 12`), which will store the minimum cost to reach a position within the first `m` people.

4. **Looping Through the Queue**: The program iterates through the queue from the end to the beginning (from `na_frente` to 0). This is a good approach because Kirill starts at the end of the queue and can only move forward by bribing people.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If the current position `v` is within the first `m` positions (`v <= pos_final`), the program checks if the current total cost plus the cost to bribe the person at position `v` (`custo_pra_trocar_a[v]`) is less than the current best cost. If it is, the program updates `best`.
   - The program then adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`. This ensures that Kirill spends the least amount of coins to move to the next position.
   - If the current position `v` is not within the first `m` positions, the program simply adds the minimum of `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]` to `total`.

6. **Output**: After processing all positions, the program prints the value of `best`, which is the minimum cost for Kirill to be among the first `m` people in the queue.

### Analysis:
- The program correctly handles the input and output formats.
- The logic for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people is sound.
- The program ensures that Kirill spends the least amount of coins by always choosing the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It follows the logic and constraints provided in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

### Correctness:
**True**
