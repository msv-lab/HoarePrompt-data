Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It processes each test case by calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid from each cell, considering the rules for movement and inversion of the characters in the grid. The program uses two arrays, `A` and `B`, to keep track of the cumulative effects of the pinball's movements and the changes in the grid, which are then used to compute the time for each cell efficiently.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - The function `func_1` is called to process the string `s`.
   - Two arrays `A` and `B` are used to store the cumulative movements of the pinball when it starts moving to the right and to the left, respectively.
   - `idx_A` and `idx_B` are used to store the indices of the characters '>' and '<' in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating Movements**:
   - For each character in the string `s` that is '>', the program calculates the cumulative time it would take for a pinball to move to the right and leave the grid, considering the inversions.
   - Similarly, for each character in the string `s` that is '<', the program calculates the cumulative time it would take for a pinball to move to the left and leave the grid, considering the inversions.

4. **Answering Queries**:
   - The program iterates through each cell in the string `s` and prints the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from that cell.
   - The calculations take into account the cumulative effects stored in `A` and `B` and the positions of the characters in `idx_A` and `idx_B`.

The program's logic and structure align with the problem requirements, and it handles the edge cases and multiple test cases efficiently. Therefore, the program is correct.
