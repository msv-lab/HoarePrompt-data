You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are designing a new video game. It has n scenarios, which the player may
play in any order, but each scenario must be played exactly once. When a
player switches from a scenario to another scenario, the game shows a
specially crafted transition video to make it all feel part of one big story.
This video is specific to a pair of scenarios, but not to their order, in
other words, the video playing when switching from scenario a to scenario b is
the same as the video playing when switching from scenario b to scenario a .
Therefore, you need to create \frac{n(n-1)}{2} different transition videos,
one for each possible pair of different scenarios.

Each transition video can be either funny or scary. It is boring to see too
many funny videos or too many scary videos in a row. Therefore, your goal is
to create the videos in such a way that no matter in which order does the
player approach the scenarios, they will never see more than \lceil
\frac{3n}{4} \rceil transition videos of the same type in a row.

You have already come up with ideas for at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor of
the transition videos, and therefore already know if those will be funny or
scary. Now you need to choose funny or scary for all other transition videos
in such a way that the above requirement is satisfied.

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 24 ) — the number of
scenarios in the game.

The next n lines describe the partial transition video plan. Each of those
lines contains n characters. The j -th character of the i -th line corresponds
to the transition video between the i -th and the j -th scenarios. It will be
F if the corresponding transition video will be funny, S if the corresponding
transition video will be scary, ? if the corresponding transition video is
still undecided, or . if i=j .

It is guaranteed that the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th
character of the i -th line will be the same for all i and j . It is
guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor (n divided by 2, rounded
down) transition videos will already be decided, in other words, that at most
2\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input will be F or S.

Output

Print n lines describing the full transition video plan in the same format as
the input. Each of those lines must contain n characters. The j -th character
of the i -th line must be F if the corresponding transition video is funny, S
if the corresponding transition video is scary, or . if i=j .

Each ? character from the input must be replaced with either F or S, and all
other characters from the input must remain unchanged. It must still hold that
the i -th character of the j -th line and the j -th character of the i -th
line are the same for all i and j .

For each permutation of the n scenarios, it must hold that the transition
videos corresponding to playing the scenarios in this order do not have more
than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil (3n divided by 4, rounded up) videos of the
same type consecutively.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them. It can be proven that for
all inputs satisfying the constraints of this problem a solution always
exists.

Note

In the first sample: We are allowed \lceil \frac{3\cdot 5}{4} \rceil=4
transition videos of the same type in a row, but for any permutation of the 5
scenarios the player will see only 4 transition videos in total, therefore we
can choose funny or scary freely. We must still respect the already chosen
types.

In the second sample: One of the 479001600 possible permutations of scenarios
is 1, 7, 4, 12, 9, 8, 2, 6, 10, 3, 11, 5. The player will get the following
sequence of transition videos for this permutation: SSSSSSSSSFS. Even though
this sequence has 10 scary transition videos in total, it has only 9 scary
transition videos in a row, which is the maximum allowed amount (\lceil
\frac{3\cdot 12}{4} \rceil=9 ).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 24) and a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing a symmetric transition video plan matrix. Each character in the matrix can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (diagonal, no transition). The function processes this matrix to identify rows and columns with specific characteristics and then modifies the '?' characters in the matrix. Specifically, it counts the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and column, and based on these counts, it creates two lists: `sa` for rows with at least one 'F' and no 'S' in the corresponding column, and `sb` for columns with at least one 'S' and no 'F' in the corresponding row. If the length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb`, the function replaces '?' characters in the first quarter of `sa` with 'F' and the rest with 'S'. If the length of `sa` is less than the length of `sb`, the function replaces '?' characters in the first quarter of `sb` with 'S' and the rest with 'F'. The function then prints the modified matrix. The original matrix `xx` remains unchanged, and the lists `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` retain their final states.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program reads the integer `n` and initializes two lists `a` and `b` of size `n + 1` to keep track of the number of funny and scary transitions for each scenario.
   - It also initializes a list `xx` to store the input lines, with an empty string at the beginning to make the indices 1-based.

2. **Counting Known Transitions**:
   - For each scenario `i`, the program reads a line of input and iterates through it.
   - If the character at position `j` is 'F', it increments the count of funny transitions for both `i` and `j` in the list `a`.
   - If the character at position `j` is 'S', it increments the count of scary transitions for both `i` and `j` in the list `b`.
   - The input line is appended to the list `xx`.

3. **Identifying Scenarios with Known Transitions**:
   - The program creates two lists `sa` and `sb` to store scenarios that have only funny or only scary transitions, respectively.
   - It iterates through the scenarios and appends the scenario index to `sa` if it has at least one funny transition and no scary transitions.
   - Similarly, it appends the scenario index to `sb` if it has at least one scary transition and no funny transitions.

4. **Assigning Unknown Transitions**:
   - The program checks if the number of scenarios in `sa` is greater than or equal to the number of scenarios in `sb`.
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it assigns the remaining scenarios to `sa` and then assigns transitions:
     - If a transition is already known (not '?'), it keeps the same value.
     - If a transition is unknown and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sa`, it assigns 'F'.
     - Otherwise, it assigns 'S'.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, it assigns the remaining scenarios to `sb` and then assigns transitions:
     - If a transition is already known (not '?'), it keeps the same value.
     - If a transition is unknown and either `i` or `j` is in the first `n // 4` elements of `sb`, it assigns 'S'.
     - Otherwise, it assigns 'F'.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the full transition plan, ensuring that the symmetry condition (i.e., the i-th character of the j-th line and the j-th character of the i-th line are the same) is maintained.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Symmetry Condition**: The program ensures that the transition matrix is symmetric by reading the input and using the same values for both `xx[i][j-1]` and `xx[j][i-1]`.
- **Known Transitions**: The program correctly counts and maintains the known transitions.
- **Unknown Transitions**: The program assigns unknown transitions in a way that tries to balance the number of funny and scary transitions. However, the logic for assigning transitions is not optimal and may not always ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transitions of the same type are consecutive for all permutations of scenarios.

### Potential Issues:
- **Balancing Transitions**: The program's approach to balancing transitions by assigning 'F' or 'S' based on the first `n // 4` elements of `sa` or `sb` may not always work. For example, if the known transitions are already close to the limit, the program might not be able to avoid exceeding the limit for some permutations.
- **Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle edge cases where the number of known transitions is very close to the limit, which could lead to violations of the constraint.

### Conclusion:
Given the constraints and the problem requirements, the program's approach to assigning unknown transitions is not guaranteed to always produce a valid solution. Therefore, the program is not correct in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
