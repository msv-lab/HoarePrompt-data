The function `func` is designed to process multiple test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) representing the number of elements in the array `a`, and a list of `n-1` integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500) representing the elements of the array `x`. The function accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

The function returns the result of processing each test case, which is not explicitly defined in the provided information. However, based on the parameters and constraints, we can infer that the function processes the array `x` in some way for each test case and returns a result for each case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list of `n-1` integers `x` (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500). The function processes each test case and returns a result for each case. The sum of values `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
