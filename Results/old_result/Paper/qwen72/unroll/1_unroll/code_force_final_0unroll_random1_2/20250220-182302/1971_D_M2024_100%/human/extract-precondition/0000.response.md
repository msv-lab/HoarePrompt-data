Precondition: **The function should take a single argument, a binary string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500), where |s| denotes the length of the string `s`. The string `s` consists only of characters '0' and '1'.**

However, since the function definition provided does not include any parameters, it seems there might be a mistake. The correct function definition should include the parameter `s`:

```python
def func(s):
```

With this correction, the precondition would be:

Precondition: **s is a binary string (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500) consisting of characters '0' and '1'.**
