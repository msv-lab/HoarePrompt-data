### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the next sign's year is not strictly after the previous sign's year. Let's analyze the provided function `func_1` to see if this is indeed the case.

The function `func_1` iterates through each test case and for each test case, it iterates through the list of signs `a`. The key part of the function is the calculation of the next year in which the sign occurs:

```python
if current_year % ai == 0:
    next_year = current_year + ai
else:
    next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
```

This logic can be broken down as follows:
- If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
- If `current_year` is not a multiple of `ai`, the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than `current_year`.

Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
1
3
2 3 6
```
- The first sign occurs in year 2.
- The second sign occurs in year 3 (strictly after year 2).
- The third sign occurs in year 6 (strictly after year 3).

Let's trace the function with this input:
1. `current_year = 0`
2. For the first sign (2):
   - `current_year % 2 == 0` is False.
   - `next_year = (0 // 2 + 1) * 2 = 2`.
   - `current_year = 2`.
3. For the second sign (3):
   - `current_year % 3 == 0` is False.
   - `next_year = (2 // 3 + 1) * 3 = 3`.
   - `current_year = 3`.
4. For the third sign (6):
   - `current_year % 6 == 0` is False.
   - `next_year = (3 // 6 + 1) * 6 = 6`.
   - `current_year = 6`.

The function correctly outputs 6 for this example, which matches the expected result.

### Verification of the Function Summary:
The function summary states that `func_1` returns the smallest positive integer that is the next year in which all signs in the list `a` will align. However, the function actually returns the year in which the n-th sign occurs, which is the year of the apocalypse. The function summary is slightly misleading, but the function itself is correct for the given problem description.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate. The function `func_1` correctly handles the case where the next sign's year is strictly after the previous sign's year. The provided logic ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is strictly greater than `current_year`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
