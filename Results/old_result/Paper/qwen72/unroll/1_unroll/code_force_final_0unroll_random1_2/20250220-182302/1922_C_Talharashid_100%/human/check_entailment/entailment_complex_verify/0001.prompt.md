You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the minimum travel costs for each city, and the results of the queries are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum travel cost between two specified cities. The function reads input from the user, including the number of test cases, the number of cities, the city coordinates, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It populates two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, with the minimum travel costs for each city, and uses these dictionaries to compute the travel costs for the queries. The function does not modify the input values but prints the results of the queries directly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` cities on a number line with coordinates in ascending order.
   - For each city, the closest city is unique.
   - We need to answer `m` queries, each asking for the minimum number of coins required to travel from city `x` to city `y`.

2. **Preprocessing:**
   - The program uses two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, to store the minimum number of coins required to travel from each city to the closest city in the forward and backward directions, respectively.
   - `d1` is used to store the minimum coins required to travel from city `i` to the closest city in the forward direction.
   - `d2` is used to store the minimum coins required to travel from city `i` to the closest city in the backward direction.

3. **Forward Direction Calculation (`d1`):**
   - The program initializes `d1[2]` to 1 because the closest city to the second city is the first city, and the cost is 1 coin.
   - For each city `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
     - If the distance to the next city `i+1` is less than the distance to the previous city `i-1`, then the closest city to `i+1` is `i`, and the cost is 1 coin plus the cost to reach `i`.
     - Otherwise, the closest city to `i+1` is `i+2`, and the cost is the distance between `i+1` and `i` plus the cost to reach `i`.

4. **Backward Direction Calculation (`d2`):**
   - The program initializes `d2[n-1]` to 1 because the closest city to the second-to-last city is the last city, and the cost is 1 coin.
   - For each city `i` from `n-2` to 1:
     - If the distance to the previous city `i-1` is less than the distance to the next city `i+1`, then the closest city to `i-1` is `i`, and the cost is 1 coin plus the cost to reach `i`.
     - Otherwise, the closest city to `i-1` is `i-2`, and the cost is the distance between `i` and `i-1` plus the cost to reach `i`.

5. **Query Handling:**
   - For each query, the program checks if `y` is greater than `x`.
   - If `y > x`, it prints the difference `d1[y] - d1[x]` to get the minimum coins required to travel from `x` to `y` in the forward direction.
   - If `y < x`, it prints the difference `d2[y] - d2[x]` to get the minimum coins required to travel from `x` to `y` in the backward direction.

6. **Issues and Corrections:**
   - The program has a logical error in the preprocessing steps. Specifically, the way `d1` and `d2` are calculated does not correctly handle the distances and costs.
   - The correct approach should be to calculate the minimum cost to travel to the closest city in both directions and then use these precomputed values to answer the queries efficiently.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Explanation:
The program's logic for calculating the minimum number of coins to travel to the closest city in both directions is flawed. The correct approach should involve calculating the minimum cost to travel to the closest city for each city and then using these precomputed values to answer the queries. The current implementation does not correctly handle the distances and costs, leading to incorrect results.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def min_coins_to_travel(a, n):
    # Precompute the closest city in both directions
    closest = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i == 1:
            closest[i] = 1
        else:
            if a[i] - a[i-1] < a[i-1] - a[i-2]:
                closest[i] = i - 1
            else:
                closest[i] = i + 1

    # Precompute the minimum coins to travel to the closest city in both directions
    forward = [0] * n
    backward = [0] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        if closest[i] == i - 1:
            forward[i] = 1 + forward[i - 1]
        else:
            forward[i] = a[i] - a[i - 1]
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if closest[i] == i + 1:
            backward[i] = 1 + backward[i + 1]
        else:
            backward[i] = a[i + 1] - a[i]

    return forward, backward

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        forward, backward = min_coins_to_travel(a, n)
        m = int(input())
        for _ in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            if x < y:
                print(min(forward[y-1] - forward[x-1], a[y-1] - a[x-1]))
            else:
                print(min(backward[x-1] - backward[y-1], a[x-1] - a[y-1]))

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **`min_coins_to_travel` function:**
  - This function precomputes the closest city for each city and the minimum coins required to travel to the closest city in both forward and backward directions.
  - `forward[i]` stores the minimum coins required to travel from city `i` to the closest city in the forward direction.
  - `backward[i]` stores the minimum coins required to travel from city `i` to the closest city in the backward direction.

- **Query Handling:**
  - For each query, the program calculates the minimum cost to travel from city `x` to city `y` by considering both the forward and backward precomputed values and the direct distance between the cities.
  - The result is the minimum of the two possible costs.

This corrected program should handle the problem correctly and efficiently.
