The function `func` is described with parameter constraints and relationships but lacks explicit parameters in the function definition. Based on the provided constraints, it can be inferred that the function likely accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, for each test case, and an additional parameter `t` that represents the number of test cases. The function is expected to return a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case, but the specific output is not detailed in the given information. However, given the constraints, the function's primary task is to process each test case and return a result that is consistent with the constraints provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case based on the values of `n` and `k`.**
