Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the frequencies of the two installations are the same (i.e., \(a = b\)). According to the problem description, if both installations have the same frequency and the visibility time \(m\) is large enough, the number of fireworks visible at the same time can be significantly higher. However, the program does not account for this scenario properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 10
```
The expected output is 12, because both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 11 minutes (from \(x\) to \(x + 10\)). Therefore, at any given minute, there will be 11 fireworks from the first installation and 11 fireworks from the second installation, making a total of 22 fireworks visible. However, the program outputs 21, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the calculation of `mn` and the subsequent logic, which does not correctly handle the overlap when \(a = b\). The program should account for the fact that when \(a = b\), the number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(2 \times (m + 1)\) minus the overlap (which is 1 in this case).
