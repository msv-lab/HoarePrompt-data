Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails when the number of yogurts `A` is 1. In this case, the program should simply return the price of one yogurt `B`, because the promotion price `C` is not applicable. However, the program does not handle this edge case and will incorrectly output the promotion price `C` if `A` is 1 and `C` is less than `B * 2`.

Example input where the program fails:
```
1
1 5 9
```

Expected output:
```
5
```

Actual output:
```
9
```
