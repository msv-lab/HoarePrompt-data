### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Loop Over Test Cases:**
   - The function `func` starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \) from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer \( n \) which represents the length of the permutation \( p \).

2. **Finding the First Index \( k \):**
   - The variable \( k \) is initialized to 1.
   - The function iterates over the range from 2 to \( n-1 \) (inclusive).
   - For each \( i \) in this range, it makes a query to compare \( p_0 \mid p_k \) with \( p_0 \mid p_i \).
   - If the result of the query is "<", it updates \( k \) to \( i \).
   - This loop ensures that \( k \) is the index such that \( p_0 \mid p_k \) is the maximum among all \( p_0 \mid p_i \) for \( i \) in the range [1, \( n-1 \)].

3. **Finding the Second Index \( best \):**
   - The variable \( best \) is initialized to 0.
   - The function iterates over the range from 1 to \( n-1 \) (inclusive).
   - For each \( i \) in this range, it makes a query to compare \( p_k \mid p_{best} \) with \( p_k \mid p_i \).
   - If the result of the query is "<", it updates \( best \) to \( i \).
   - This loop ensures that \( best \) is the index such that \( p_k \mid p_{best} \) is the maximum among all \( p_k \mid p_i \) for \( i \) in the range [0, \( n-1 \)].

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The function prints the indices \( k \) and \( best \) in the format "!".
   - This output is not considered a query and is used to provide the final answer for the test case.

5. **Query Count Analysis:**
   - The first loop makes \( n-2 \) queries.
   - The second loop makes \( n-1 \) queries.
   - The total number of queries for each test case is \( (n-2) + (n-1) = 2n - 3 \).
   - Since \( 2n - 3 \le 3n \) for \( n \ge 2 \), the function does not exceed the query limit.

6. **Correctness of the Solution:**
   - The function aims to find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized.
   - By finding \( k \) and \( best \) as described, the function ensures that \( p_k \) and \( p_{best} \) are the indices where the bitwise OR operation is maximized.
   - However, the bitwise OR operation being maximized does not necessarily mean that the bitwise XOR operation is maximized. The bitwise XOR operation is different and does not follow the same properties as the bitwise OR operation.

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly find the indices \( i \) and \( j \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized. It only ensures that the bitwise OR operation is maximized, which is not the same as maximizing the bitwise XOR operation.

**Correctness: False**
