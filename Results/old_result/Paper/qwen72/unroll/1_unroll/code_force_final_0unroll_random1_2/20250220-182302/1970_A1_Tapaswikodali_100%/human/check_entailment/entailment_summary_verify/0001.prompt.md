You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")", and prints a rearranged version of the string `s` where the parentheses are sorted based on their balance and position. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the sorted string is printed to the console.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to compute the "balanced shuffle" of a given balanced parentheses sequence.
   - The balanced shuffle involves:
     - Calculating the balance of each prefix.
     - Sorting the characters based on their prefix balance in increasing order.
     - For characters with the same prefix balance, sorting them in decreasing order of their positions.
   - The final sequence is formed by the characters in the sorted order.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Program**:
   - **Function 1** (`func_1`):
     - This function is not used in the provided program. It seems to be a comparison function, but it is not called anywhere.
   - **Function 2** (`func_2`):
     - **Step 1**: Initialize the length of the string `n` and an empty list `balance_info` to store the balance information.
     - **Step 2**: Compute the balance of each prefix and store the balance, position, and character in a `BalanceInfo` object.
     - **Step 3**: Sort the `balance_info` list using a lambda function that sorts by balance in increasing order and by position in decreasing order.
     - **Step 4**: Join the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list to form the result string and print it.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - **Balance Calculation**:
     - The balance is correctly updated as we iterate through the string. For each opening parenthesis '(', the balance is incremented, and for each closing parenthesis ')', the balance is decremented.
   - **Sorting**:
     - The sorting is done using a lambda function that first sorts by balance in increasing order and then by position in decreasing order. This matches the problem description.
   - **Result Construction**:
     - The result string is constructed by joining the characters from the sorted `balance_info` list, which is the correct approach.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the input constraints (non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with length not exceeding 500,000) correctly.
   - The program should work for any valid balanced parentheses sequence.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem.
   - There are no logical errors or issues with the provided code.
