Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and each integer a_i is unique and within the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; `x` is equal to `a[k]`.** 

`x` is now assigned the value of the element at index `k` in the list `a`. The list `a` remains unchanged, and the conditions on the list `a` (that it contains `n` unique integers within the specified range) still hold true.
