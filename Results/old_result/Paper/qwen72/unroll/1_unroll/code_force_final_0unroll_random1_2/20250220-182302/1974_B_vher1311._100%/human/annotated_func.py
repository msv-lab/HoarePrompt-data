#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    #The program returns a string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding value in `mapping`, which is the reverse order of the unique characters in `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding value in a mapping. This mapping is created by sorting the unique characters in `encoded` and then pairing each character with its reverse counterpart in the sorted list. The final state of the program is that the original string `encoded` is transformed into a new string based on this mapping.
