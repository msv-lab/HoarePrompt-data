The only objects in the loop head are variables `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. The loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and iterates down to `0` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least one element. Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `ans` is an empty list, `tem` is 1**
