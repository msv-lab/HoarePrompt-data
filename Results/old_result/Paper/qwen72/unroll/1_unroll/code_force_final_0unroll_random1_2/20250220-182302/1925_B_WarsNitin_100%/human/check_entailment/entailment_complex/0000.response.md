### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to find the maximum balance (GCD) of a set of `n` sub-problems whose total difficulty sums up to `x`.
   - The balance is defined as the GCD of the difficulties of all sub-problems.

2. **Algorithm Explanation:**
   - The function iterates over all possible divisors `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `i` can be the GCD of the sub-problems by ensuring that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
   - Similarly, it checks if `x // i` can be the GCD by ensuring that `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`.
   - The maximum value of `i` or `x // i` that satisfies these conditions is stored in `ans`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Divisors Check:** The function correctly checks all divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. This is efficient and ensures that all possible GCDs are considered.
   - **Conditions for GCD:** The conditions `(x - n * i) % i == 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` are used to ensure that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties is `x` and that all sub-problems have a difficulty that is a multiple of `i` or `x // i`.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - For `x = 5` and `n = 5`, the only way to split `x` into `n` sub-problems is to have each sub-problem with a difficulty of `1`, which is correctly handled by the function.
     - For `x = 10` and `n = 3`, the function correctly identifies that the maximum GCD is `2` (e.g., difficulties 4, 2, 4).

4. **Efficiency:**
   - The function iterates up to the square root of `x`, which is efficient given the constraints (`1 <= x <= 10^8`).

5. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum GCD for each test case, which is the required output.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.
