Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` to `func_7` are simply input handling functions and do not perform any of the required operations. Functions `func_8` and `func_9` are related to calculating the product of elements in an array, which is not relevant to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

A correct solution would involve:
1. Reading the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, reading the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Determining the maximum number of elements that can be made equal by adding a permutation to the array.

The provided code does not perform these steps, and thus, it is incorrect for the given problem description.
