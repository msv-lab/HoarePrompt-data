Output State: **The function should take two parameters: `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000), the number of test cases, and a list of lists, where each inner list contains `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100) integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^6), representing the periodicities of the signs for each test case. `t` is now an integer value provided by the user.**
