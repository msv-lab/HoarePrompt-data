### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Nikita can perform `n` moves, where each move is either adding or removing one cube.
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - If `n` equals `m`, it means Nikita can simply add `m` cubes in `m` moves, which is straightforward. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m` is greater than `n`, it is impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".
   - If `m` equals `n - 1`, it means Nikita can add `n - 1` cubes and then remove one cube, resulting in `m` cubes. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - If both `m` and `n` are even, it is possible to achieve `m` cubes by adding and removing cubes in such a way that the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes matches the parity of the number of moves. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - If both `m` and `n` are odd, the same logic applies as for the even case. Hence, the answer is "Yes".
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it means the parity of `m` and `n` does not match, making it impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Hence, the answer is "No".

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m` and checks the conditions mentioned above.
   - The conditions in the program correctly cover all the scenarios described in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `n` and `m` are both 1, or where `n` is 1 and `m` is greater than 1.
   - It also correctly handles cases where `n` and `m` are both even or both odd.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The program prints "Yes" or "No" based on the conditions, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, and it handles all the edge cases and conditions specified in the problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
