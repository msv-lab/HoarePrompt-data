The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0. The variable `i` will be initialized to 0 by the `range(n)` function at the start of the loop.

State: **`x` is a list of integers of length `n`, `y` is a list of integers of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of `False` of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `bipartite` is `True`, `ok` is `False`, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
