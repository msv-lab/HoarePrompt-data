Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program appears to correctly handle the problem description for every potential case. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why:

1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**:
   - The `dp` array is initialized to store the number of possible configurations for a given number of available rows/columns.
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly set, as there is only 1 way to place a rook in a 1x1 board and 3 ways to place rooks in a 2x2 board (one white rook, one black rook, or both).

2. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size `n` using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \cdot (i - 1) \cdot dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007
     \]
   - This recurrence relation is correct because:
     - `dp[i - 1]` accounts for the configurations where no rook is placed in the i-th row/column.
     - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` accounts for the configurations where a rook is placed in the i-th row and a rook is placed in the i-th column, but not both in the same position.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the board size `n` and the number of moves `k`.
   - It then reads the `k` moves and adds the rows and columns to the `invalid` set to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of available rows/columns by subtracting the size of the `invalid` set from `n`.
   - It then prints the result from the `dp` array for the number of available rows/columns, ensuring the result is at least 1 (since there is always at least one configuration).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `r = c` and the computer skips its turn.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the board size `n` is 1, as the `dp` array is initialized with `dp[1] = 1`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly and follows the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
