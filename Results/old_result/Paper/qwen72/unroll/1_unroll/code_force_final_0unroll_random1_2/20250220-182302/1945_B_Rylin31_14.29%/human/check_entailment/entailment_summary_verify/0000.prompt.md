You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
One of the days of the hike coincided with a holiday, so in the evening at the
camp, it was decided to arrange a festive fireworks display. For this purpose,
the organizers of the hike bought two installations for launching fireworks
and a huge number of shells for launching.

Both installations are turned on simultaneously. The first installation
launches fireworks every a minutes (i.e., after a, 2 \cdot a, 3 \cdot a, \dots
minutes after launch). The second installation launches fireworks every b
minutes (i.e., after b, 2 \cdot b, 3 \cdot b, \dots minutes after launch).

Each firework is visible in the sky for m + 1 minutes after launch, i.e., if a
firework was launched after x minutes after the installations were turned on,
it will be visible every minute from x to x + m , inclusive. If one firework
was launched m minutes after another, both fireworks will be visible for one
minute.

What is the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the
same time?

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow the
descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains integers a , b , m (1 \le
a, b, m \le 10^{18} ) — the frequency of launching for the first installation,
the second installation, and the time the firework is visible in the sky.

Output

For each set of input data, output a single number — the maximum number of
fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

    3 4 10
    
    7 8 56
    
    5 6 78123459896
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 1000000000000000000

Output

    2

    17
    28645268630

    2000000000000000002
    
Note

In the first set of input data, the fireworks are visible in the sky for 5
minutes. Since the first installation launches fireworks every 6 minutes, and
the second one every 7 minutes, two fireworks launched from the same
installation will not be visible in the sky at the same time. At the same
time, after 7 minutes from the start of the holiday, one firework from the
first and one from the second camp will be visible. Thus, it is possible to
see no more than 2 fireworks simultaneously.

In the third set of input data, 17 fireworks will be visible after 112
minutes:

  * 9 fireworks launched from the first installation at times [56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105, 112 ]; 
  * 8 fireworks launched from the second installation at times [56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112 ].

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = map(int, input().split())
        mn = min(a, b) + m
        if m % a == 0 and m % b == 0 and (a != 1) and (b != 1):
            print(mn // a + mn // b + 1)
        else:
            print(mn // a + mn // b)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` from the input. It then calculates a value `mn` as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. If `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and neither `a` nor `b` is 1, it prints the result of `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`. After processing all test cases, the function completes and no values are returned. The state of the program remains unchanged except for the output that has been printed for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the frequencies of the two installations are the same (i.e., \(a = b\)). According to the problem description, if both installations have the same frequency and the visibility time \(m\) is large enough, the number of fireworks visible at the same time can be significantly higher. However, the program does not account for this scenario properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1 10
```
The expected output is 12, because both installations launch fireworks every minute, and each firework is visible for 11 minutes (from \(x\) to \(x + 10\)). Therefore, at any given minute, there will be 11 fireworks from the first installation and 11 fireworks from the second installation, making a total of 22 fireworks visible. However, the program outputs 21, which is incorrect.

The issue lies in the calculation of `mn` and the subsequent logic, which does not correctly handle the overlap when \(a = b\). The program should account for the fact that when \(a = b\), the number of fireworks visible at the same time is \(2 \times (m + 1)\) minus the overlap (which is 1 in this case).
