Output State: **`t` is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `m` where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, representing the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively. `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe the i-th person to move to the front. `b` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9, representing the cost to bribe each person between positions j and i when Kirill moves from position i to j. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. `x` is an input integer. `custos` is an empty list.**
