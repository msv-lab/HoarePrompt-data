The function `func` is intended to process a series of test cases. It accepts an integer `t` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` where `3 ≤ n ≤ 78`, representing an encoded word. The function returns the decoded word for each test case.

However, the provided function signature does not include any parameters. Assuming the function is designed to handle these parameters, the correct function signature should be:
```
def func(t, n):
```

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 100) representing the number of test cases, and `n` (an integer between 3 and 78) representing an encoded word. For each test case, it returns the decoded word.**
