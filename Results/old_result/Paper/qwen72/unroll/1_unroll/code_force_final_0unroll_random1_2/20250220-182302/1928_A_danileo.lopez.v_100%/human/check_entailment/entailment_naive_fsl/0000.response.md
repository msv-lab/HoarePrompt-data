Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are even numbers correctly. Specifically, it fails when both `a` and `b` are even and the resulting rectangle is the same as the original after the cut. For example, consider the input `4 2`:

- The program will check if `a % 2 == 0` (which is true for `4`), and then it will check if `a1 != b` (where `a1 = 4 // 2 = 2`). Since `a1` is equal to `b`, it will not print "Yes" and will move to the next condition.
- The program will then check if `b % 2 == 0` (which is true for `2`), and it will check if `b1 != a` (where `b1 = 2 // 2 = 1`). Since `b1` is not equal to `a`, it will print "Yes".

However, the correct output for the input `4 2` should be "No" because cutting the `4 \times 2` rectangle into two `2 \times 2` rectangles and then forming a new rectangle from these two will result in the same `4 \times 2` rectangle, which is not a different rectangle.

Thus, the program is incorrect for this case.
