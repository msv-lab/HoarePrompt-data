Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed in several ways:

1. **Subsequence Check**: The program uses a bitmask to track the presence of characters in the string `s`, but this approach is not sufficient to check if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`. The bitmask `cur` is used to track the presence of characters in the current segment of the string, but it does not correctly handle the formation of subsequences of length `n`.

2. **Counting Subsequences**: The variable `cnt` is used to count the number of times a complete set of characters (from 'a' to the k-th character) is found in `s`. However, this does not correspond to the number of subsequences of length `n` that can be formed. The program increments `cnt` whenever all `k` characters are found in the current segment, which is not the correct way to count subsequences of length `n`.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: When the program determines that not all subsequences are present, it tries to generate a missing subsequence by appending characters to `ans`. However, the logic for generating this missing subsequence is incorrect. The program simply appends a character that is missing from the current bitmask and then appends 'a' characters, which does not guarantee that the generated string is a valid missing subsequence.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of them is a subsequence of `s`. If any of these strings are not found, you can print "NO" and the missing string. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        
        # Generate all possible strings of length n using the first k alphabets
        all_possible = [''.join(p) for p in product('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'[:k], repeat=n)]
        
        # Check if each possible string is a subsequence of s
        for possible in all_possible:
            if not is_subsequence(possible, s):
                print('NO')
                print(possible)
                break
        else:
            print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected program uses the `itertools.product` function to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s` using the `is_subsequence` function. If any string is not found, it prints "NO" and the missing string. If all strings are found, it prints "YES".
