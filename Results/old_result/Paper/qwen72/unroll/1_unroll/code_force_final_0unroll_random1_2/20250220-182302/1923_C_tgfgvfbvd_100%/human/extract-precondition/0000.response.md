Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes an array `c` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9), and a list of `q` queries, each query being a pair of integers `(l_i, r_i)` (1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n). The function should also handle the constraints that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5, and the sum of `q` over all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.**
