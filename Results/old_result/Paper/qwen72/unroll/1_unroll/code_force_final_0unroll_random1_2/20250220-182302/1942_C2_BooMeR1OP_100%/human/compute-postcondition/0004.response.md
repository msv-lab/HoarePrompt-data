Functionality: ** The function `func` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of vertices `n`, the number of chosen vertices `x`, and the number of additional vertices `y` from the input. It also reads a list of `x` integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie. The function calculates and prints a value `ans` which represents the number of valid moves Bessie can make, considering the gaps between the chosen vertices and the additional vertices `y`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the result for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not preserve the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of chosen vertices. **
