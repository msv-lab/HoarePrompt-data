### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - The computer mirrors your moves, except when the move is on the diagonal (i.e., \( r = c \)).
   - The goal is to determine the number of different final configurations possible after all valid moves are made, modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - The function `func_1` precomputes the number of valid configurations for an \( i \times i \) board where no two rooks attack each other.
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of valid configurations for an \( i \times i \) board.
   - The base cases are:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: Only one configuration (one rook).
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Three configurations (one rook in each cell of a 2x2 board, or two rooks in non-attacking positions).
   - The recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`:
       - `dp[i - 1]`: Placing one rook in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.
       - `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]`: Placing two rooks in non-attacking positions in the \( i \)-th row and \( i \)-th column.

3. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the board size \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then reads the \( k \) moves and adds the row and column indices to a set `invalid` to keep track of the positions that are already occupied.
   - The number of valid configurations for the remaining \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) rows (or columns) is given by `dp[n - len(invalid)]`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 0, there are no valid moves left, and the number of configurations is 1 (the current state).
   - If \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 1, there is only one valid configuration (one rook).

5. **Precomputation**:
   - The `func_1` function precomputes the DP values up to 300,000, which is sufficient given the constraints.
   - This ensures that the DP values are available for any test case within the given limits.

6. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, which is a common practice in competitive programming.

### Challenges to the Original Assessment:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` is correctly defined and precomputes the DP values as described.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is correct for the problem of placing non-attacking rooks on an \( i \times i \) board.

- **Handling Test Cases**:
  - The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
  - It correctly identifies the invalid positions by adding both the row and column indices of the moves to the `invalid` set.
  - The number of valid configurations is correctly computed using the precomputed DP values.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge case where \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \) is 0 or 1.
  - The use of `max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])` ensures that the program outputs 1 when there are no valid moves left, which is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for precomputing the DP values and calculating the final configurations is sound.

Final: **True**
