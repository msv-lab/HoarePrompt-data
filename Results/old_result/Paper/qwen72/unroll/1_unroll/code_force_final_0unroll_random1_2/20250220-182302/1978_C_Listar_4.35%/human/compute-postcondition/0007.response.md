Output State: **The program returns nothing.** The return statement is encountered without specifying any value, so the program execution ends without returning any specific value. However, before the return, `func_3` was executed with the argument `l`, where `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and `n` and `k` are the values returned by `func_2()`. The specific values of `n`, `k`, and `l` are not provided, but `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 200,000, `k` is a non-negative integer up to 1,000,000,000,000, and `l` is the output of `func_1(n, k)`.
