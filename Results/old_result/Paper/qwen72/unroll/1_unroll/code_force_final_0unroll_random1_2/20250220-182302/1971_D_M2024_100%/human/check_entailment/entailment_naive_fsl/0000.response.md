Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the binary string is already sorted and consists of only '0's or only '1's correctly. Specifically, the program will print `1` for any string that does not have a '0' followed by a '1', which is incorrect for strings that are already sorted and consist of only '0's or only '1's. For example, for the input `00000000`, the program will print `1`, which is correct, but for the input `11111111`, it will also print `1`, which is incorrect. The correct output for a string consisting of only '1's should be `1` because it is already sorted and no cuts are needed. The program should print `1` for any string that is already sorted, regardless of whether it contains '0's or '1's.
