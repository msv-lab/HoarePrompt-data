### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases using `func_10()`, which correctly reads an integer from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` using `func_7()`, which correctly reads and returns a list of integers from the input.

2. **Solution Logic**:
   - The function `func_14()` is responsible for generating the sequence `a` that meets the problem's requirements.
   - The function first converts `n` and `k` to their binary representations to understand the bit patterns.
   - If `k == 1`, it handles a special case where the sequence is constructed to avoid a subsequence sum of 1.
   - For the general case where `k != 1`, the function constructs a sequence that avoids a subsequence sum of `k` but ensures that all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible.

3. **Special Case Handling**:
   - When `k == 1`, the function checks if `n == 2`. If so, it returns the sequence `[2]`.
   - If `n > 2`, it starts with the sequence `[2, 3]` and appends powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - This special case handling is correct because for `k == 1`, the only way to ensure no subsequence sums to 1 is to use numbers greater than 1. The sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, ...]` ensures that all sums from 2 to `n` are possible, but 1 is not.

4. **General Case Handling**:
   - The function constructs a sequence by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
   - It then appends `k - 1 - sum(ans)` to ensure the sum of the sequence does not equal `k`.
   - It appends `k + 1` and `2 * k + 1` to the sequence to cover additional values.
   - Finally, it appends powers of 2 from the length of the binary representation of `k` to the length of the binary representation of `n`.
   - This approach ensures that the sequence avoids a subsequence sum of `k` while covering all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`).

5. **Output**:
   - The function `func_14()` returns the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The function `func_15()` writes the output for each test case to the standard output.
   - The output format is correct, with the length of the sequence on the first line and the sequence elements on the second line.

6. **Validation**:
   - The sequence generated by `func_14()` should meet the problem's requirements:
     - No subsequence should sum to `k`.
     - All other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) should be possible.
   - The sequence length is at most 25, which is within the problem's constraints.
   - The logic for constructing the sequence is sound and should ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly handle the input and generate a sequence that meets the problem's requirements. The logic for constructing the sequence is sound and should ensure that no subsequence sums to `k` while all other sums from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) are possible.
