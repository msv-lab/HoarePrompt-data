Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program provided does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program is flawed because it only counts transitions between '1' and '0' (stored in `cut1`) and between '0' and '1' (stored in `cut0`). However, the correct solution should count the number of '1's that appear before any '0' in the string, as each such '1' would need to be in a separate piece to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input()
        # Count the number of '1's that appear before the first '0'
        cuts = 1 if '0' in s else 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '1' and '0' in s[i:]:
                cuts += 1
        print(cuts)

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This version correctly counts the number of pieces needed by ensuring that each '1' that appears before a '0' is in a separate piece. The initial `cuts` is set to 1 if there is at least one '0' in the string, to account for the base case where the string is already sorted or contains no '0's. Then, for each '1' that appears before a '0', an additional cut is required. This ensures that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
