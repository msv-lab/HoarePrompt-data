Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1. **Function Call Before Definition**: The function `func_1()` is called before it is defined. This will result in a `NameError` in Python.

2. **Incorrect Subsequence Check**: The program attempts to check if all possible strings of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence in `s`. However, the logic implemented in `func_1()` is flawed. It only checks if a window of `k` unique characters appears in the string `s` and then appends the last character of the window to the answer. This does not correctly determine if all possible strings of length `n` are subsequences of `s`.

3. **Incorrect Output for NO Case**: When the program determines that the answer is `NO`, it prints a string that is not necessarily a valid string of length `n` formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The logic for generating this string is incorrect and may produce an invalid string.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if each of these strings is a subsequence of `s`. If any string is not a subsequence, print `NO` and the string. If all strings are subsequences, print `YES`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from itertools import product

def is_subsequence(x, y):
    it = iter(y)
    return all(c in it for c in x)

def func_1():
    (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    alphabets = ''.join(chr(i + 97) for i in range(k))
    all_possible_strings = [''.join(p) for p in product(alphabets, repeat=n)]
    
    for possible_string in all_possible_strings:
        if not is_subsequence(possible_string, s):
            print('NO')
            print(possible_string)
            return
    print('YES')

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Generate All Possible Strings**: Use `itertools.product` to generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
2. **Check Subsequence**: Use the `is_subsequence` function to check if each generated string is a subsequence of `s`.
3. **Print Result**: If any string is not a subsequence, print `NO` and the string. If all strings are subsequences, print `YES`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly checks all possible strings and prints the appropriate output.
