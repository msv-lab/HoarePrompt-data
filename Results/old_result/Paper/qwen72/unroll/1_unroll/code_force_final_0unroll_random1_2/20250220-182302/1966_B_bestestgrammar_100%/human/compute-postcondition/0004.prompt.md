You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function `func` is expected to handle multiple test cases. Each test case includes a grid represented as a list of strings, where each string is a row in the grid and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The grid dimensions n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for tc in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        gr = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            gr.append(input())
        
        ans = 'YES'
        
        if gr[0][0] != gr[n - 1][m - 1]:
            impossible = True
            for j in range(m - 1):
                if gr[0][j] != gr[0][j + 1] or gr[n - 1][j] != gr[n - 1][j + 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
            impossible = True
            for i in range(n - 1):
                if gr[i][0] != gr[i + 1][0] or gr[i][m - 1] != gr[i + 1][m - 1]:
                    impossible = False
            if impossible:
                ans = 'NO'
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: The loop iterates through each test case, reads the grid dimensions and the grid itself, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `tc`, `n`, `m`, `gr`, and `ans` are updated for each test case, but their final values after the loop will be the state corresponding to the last test case processed. The variable `t` remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func` accepts multiple test cases, each containing a grid represented as a list of strings. Each string in the grid represents a row and consists of characters 'W' and 'B'. The grid dimensions are given by integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The total number of test cases t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the sum of n * m over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The function returns a result for each test case based on the grid configuration.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
