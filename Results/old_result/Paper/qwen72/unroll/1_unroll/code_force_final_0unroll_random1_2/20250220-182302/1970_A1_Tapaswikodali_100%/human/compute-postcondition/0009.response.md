Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of balanced parentheses "(", ")", and prints a rearranged version of the string `s` where the parentheses are sorted based on their balance and position. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, the string `s` remains unchanged, and the sorted string is printed to the console. **
