Reasoning:  
The program is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to the specified algorithm. The algorithm involves creating a sorted set of unique characters from the encoded string and then mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart in this sorted set. The program then uses this mapping to decode the string.

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is a common approach for handling multiple test cases in competitive programming.
2. **Processing Test Cases**: For each test case, the program extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
3. **Decoding Function**: The function `func_1` performs the decoding:
   - It creates a sorted set of unique characters from the encoded string `b`.
   - It constructs a mapping where each character in the sorted set is paired with its symmetric counterpart.
   - It applies this mapping to each character in the encoded string to produce the decoded string.
4. **Output**: The program collects the results of decoding each test case and prints them.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm as described in the problem statement. It handles the input and output as specified, and the logic for creating the symmetric mapping and applying it to the encoded string is accurate.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
