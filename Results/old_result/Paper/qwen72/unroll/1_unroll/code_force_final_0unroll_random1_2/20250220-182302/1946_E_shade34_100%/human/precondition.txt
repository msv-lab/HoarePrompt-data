a and b are lists of integers where a represents the indices of prefix maximums and b represents the indices of suffix maximums, and both lists are sorted in increasing order. Additionally, the length of the permutation n, the number of prefix maximums m_1, and the number of suffix maximums m_2 are such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5.
