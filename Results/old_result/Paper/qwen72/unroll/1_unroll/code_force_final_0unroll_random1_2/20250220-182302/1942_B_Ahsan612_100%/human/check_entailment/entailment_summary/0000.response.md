### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The task is to reconstruct a permutation `p` of integers from 0 to `n-1` that satisfies the given array `a`.

2. **Understanding the Solution:**
   - The solution initializes a list `res` of length `n` with `None` values.
   - It starts with `mex` set to `n`, which is the maximum possible value for the MEX of the permutation.
   - The solution iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if the new value is less than the current `mex`.

3. **Verification of the Solution:**
   - The key insight is that the MEX of the prefix `p_1, p_2, ..., p_i` is always a non-negative integer that is not in the prefix.
   - By starting from the end of the array `ar` and working backwards, the solution ensures that the MEX is correctly updated and that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly.
   - The condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix, which is consistent with the definition of MEX.

4. **Example Verification:**
   - For the input `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`:
     - Starting with `mex = 5`:
       - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
       - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
       - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 0` (since `mex` is updated to `4` but `4` is already in `res`)
       - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 0 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
       - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
     - The resulting `res` is `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which is a valid permutation that satisfies the given `ar`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where `ar` is a constant array (e.g., `ar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`), which results in the permutation `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
   - The solution also handles the case where `ar` has negative values (e.g., `ar = [-2, 1, 2]`), which results in the permutation `[2, 0, 1]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly reconstructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given array `a` for each test case. The logic is sound and the examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled.

**Correctness: True**
