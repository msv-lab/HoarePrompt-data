Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to construct a permutation `p` of length `n` from the array `a` such that `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Algorithm Explanation**:
   - The function `func` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and the list `ar` of `n` integers.
   - It initializes a result list `res` with `None` values and sets `mex` to `n`.
   - It iterates over the list `ar` in reverse order.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - ar[i]` and updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.
   - Finally, it prints the resulting list `res`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible value for MEX at the start.
   - The loop iterates from the end of `ar` to the beginning, which is crucial because the MEX value is influenced by the elements that have already been placed in `res`.
   - The calculation `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` ensures that `p_i` is derived from the current MEX and the value of `ar[i]`.
   - The update `mex = mex - ar[i]` is necessary to maintain the correct MEX value for the next iteration.
   - The program ensures that the final `res` list is a valid permutation by correctly calculating and updating the MEX.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `ar` contains negative values, as seen in the example test cases.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case: `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
     - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
     - Result: `res = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`
   - This matches the expected output and the MEX calculations are correct.

6. **Final State**:
   - The final state of `t` is 0 after all test cases are processed.
   - The variables `n` and `ar` are reset for each test case, and their final state is undefined after the last test case, which is expected.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly solve the problem and handle the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
