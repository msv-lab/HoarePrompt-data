The function `func` reads an integer `t` from input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, where `n` is the size of a square grid and `k` is the minimum number of diagonals that should have at least one colored cell. It then prints the minimum number of cells that need to be colored to meet the requirement, which is `k // 2 + 1` if `4 * n - 2 == k`, or `ceil(k / 2)` otherwise. The function does not return any value. After the function concludes, `t` test cases have been processed, and the corresponding results have been printed. The values of `n` and `k` are updated for each test case, and `t` is decremented until it reaches 0.
