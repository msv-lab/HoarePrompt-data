Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, the tree is represented by a list of n-1 edges where each edge is a tuple (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the tree has exactly two leaves, the initial node for the game is an integer `u_1` such that 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ n, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists.**

The code initializes `lst` as a `defaultdict` of lists. This means that `lst` will automatically create a list for any new key that is accessed. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
