### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.
   - This part of the program is correct and follows the input format described in the problem.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` is called for each test case with the appropriate parameters.
   - Inside `func_1`, the program initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements of `a` in the order they are removed.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` and appends the appropriate element to `b` based on whether the command is 'L' or 'R', and then updates the pointers accordingly.
   - This part of the logic is correct and follows the problem description.

3. **Product Calculation:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements.
   - The program iterates through the list `b` in reverse order, updating `p` with the product of the current element and the previous value of `p`, modulo `m`.
   - This ensures that `p` always holds the product of all elements that have been removed up to the current command, modulo `m`.
   - The result `p` is then appended to `ans`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program returns the reversed list `ans`, which contains the remainders of the product of the array elements at each step, as required by the problem.
   - The reversed list is used to match the order of the commands in the string `s`.

### Correctness:
The program correctly processes the commands and outputs the remainders of the product of the array elements at each step. The logic and the order of operations are consistent with the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
