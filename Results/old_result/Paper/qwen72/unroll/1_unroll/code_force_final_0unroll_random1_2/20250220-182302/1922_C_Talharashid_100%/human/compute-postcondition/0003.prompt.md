You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; queries is a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the pairs of cities for which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        d1 = defaultdict(int)
        
        d2 = defaultdict(int)

            if l[i + 1] - l[i] < l[i] - l[i - 1]:
                d1[i + 2] = 1 + d1[i + 1]
            else:
                d1[i + 2] = l[i + 1] - l[i] + d1[i + 1]
        
        d2[n - 1] = 1
        
        for i in range(n - 2, 0, -1):
            if l[i] - l[i - 1] < l[i + 1] - l[i]:
                d2[i] = 1 + d2[i + 1]
            else:
                d2[i] = l[i] - l[i - 1] + d2[i + 1]
        
        m = int(input())
        
        for j in range(m):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            if y > x:
                print(d1[y] - d1[x])
            else:
                print(d2[y] - d2[x])
        
    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the minimum travel costs for each city, and the results of the queries are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts multiple test cases, each containing the number of cities, their coordinates, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. For each query, it returns the minimum travel cost between the two specified cities.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
