#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line from standard input (stdin), splits the line by whitespace, converts each split part into an integer, and returns an iterator that yields these integer values. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the iterator is available for use, containing the integer values from the input line.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` does not accept any parameters and returns the next line of input from stdin, excluding the trailing newline character. After the function concludes, the program state is such that the next line of input from stdin has been read and processed, and the function has returned this line as a bytes object, with any trailing newline character removed.

    #The program returns the value of `tmp + 1`, where `tmp` is the minimum value returned by `func_12` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. This value is also the value that `rank[da - 1]` is set to.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` accepts four parameters: `d` (a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers), `processing` (a list of integers initialized to 0), `da` (an integer key present in `d`), and `rank` (a list of integers initialized to 0). The function returns 1 if the list associated with the key `da` in `d` has exactly one element. Otherwise, it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` that has not been processed yet (i.e., `processing[di - 1]` is 0), and sets `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value returned by these recursive calls plus 1. The function ultimately returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`.

    #The program returns a tuple `(y, x - (a // b) * y, g)` where `x`, `y`, and `g` are the values returned by `func_13(b, a % b)`. Here, `y` is one of the values returned by `func_13`, `x - (a // b) * y` is calculated using the integer division of `a` by `b` and the value of `x` from `func_13`, and `g` is another value returned by `func_13`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two integers `a` and `b` (where `b` is not 0). It returns a tuple `(x, y, g)` where `x` and `y` are integers, and `g` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and uses the results to compute the final tuple. The final state of the program is that the function has returned a tuple containing the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `a*x + b*y = g`, and `g` is the GCD of `a` and `b`.
