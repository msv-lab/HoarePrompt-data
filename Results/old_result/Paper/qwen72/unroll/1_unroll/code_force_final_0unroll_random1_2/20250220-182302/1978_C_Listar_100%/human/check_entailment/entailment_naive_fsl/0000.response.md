Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is 0 correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is 0, the permutation should be the identity permutation (i.e., `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]`). However, the program does not return the identity permutation when `k` is 0. Instead, it attempts to perform swaps that are unnecessary and may not result in the correct permutation.

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `k = 0`. The expected output should be:
```
YES
1 2 3
```
However, the program will not return this output. It will attempt to perform swaps that are not required, potentially leading to an incorrect permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
