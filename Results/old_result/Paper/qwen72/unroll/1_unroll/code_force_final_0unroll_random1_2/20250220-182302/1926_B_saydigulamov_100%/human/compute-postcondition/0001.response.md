To ensure the loop executes, we need to focus on the variables present in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is greater than 0. The state of `i` is not relevant before the loop starts, as it will be initialized by the `range(a)` function. However, for the loop to execute at least once, `a` must be a positive integer.

Given the context of the input, `a` is an input integer, and the function `func` is expected to be called within a context that provides the input as described. The input context includes a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` test cases, each starting with an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10) representing the size of the grid, and then `n` lines of `n` characters each, where each character is either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's, and the shape size is greater than 1.

However, the specific value of `a` is not mentioned in the input context. To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state to ensure `a` is greater than 0.

State: **`a` must be greater than 0**
