### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers `a`.

2. **Sorting the List**: The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. This is a crucial step because, to maximize the score, we should always choose the smallest possible numbers in each move. By sorting the list, we ensure that the smallest numbers are at the beginning of the list.

3. **Calculating the Score**: The function initializes `score` to 0. It then iterates over the sorted list `l` in steps of 2, starting from the first element (index 0). In each iteration, it adds the element at the current index to the score. This is because, after sorting, the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are the smallest numbers in each pair of elements.

4. **Output**: After calculating the score, the function prints the score for the current test case.

5. **Optimality**: The approach of always choosing the smallest number in each pair is optimal because it ensures that the minimum value in each pair is as large as possible. This is because the smallest numbers are used first, and the remaining numbers are always the next smallest available, which maximizes the sum of the minimum values.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is 1, it will correctly add the smallest number to the score. If `n` is larger, it will correctly sum the smallest numbers in pairs.

### Correctness:
The program is correct because it follows the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by always choosing the smallest number in each pair of numbers. The sorting step ensures that the smallest numbers are considered first, and the loop correctly sums these values.

Correctness: **True**
