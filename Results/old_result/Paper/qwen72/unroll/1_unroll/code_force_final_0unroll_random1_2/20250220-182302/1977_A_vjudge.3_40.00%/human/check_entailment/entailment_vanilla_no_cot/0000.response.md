Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly solves the problem as described. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Conditions**:
   - If `n == m`, Nikita can simply put `m` cubes on the tower in `n` moves, so the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible to have more cubes than the number of moves, so the answer is "No".
   - If `m == n - 1`, Nikita can put `m` cubes on the tower and then remove one cube, so the answer is "Yes".
   - If `m % 2 == 0` and `n % 2 == 0`, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes because both `n` and `m` are even, and the difference between them can be managed by adding and removing cubes.
   - If `m % 2 != 0` and `n % 2 != 0`, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes because both `n` and `m` are odd, and the difference between them can be managed by adding and removing cubes.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, the answer is "No".

The logic covers all the necessary cases to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.
