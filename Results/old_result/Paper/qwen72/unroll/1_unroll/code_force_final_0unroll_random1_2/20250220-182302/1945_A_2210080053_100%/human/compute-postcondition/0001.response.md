Output State: **The function will print a series of outputs, each corresponding to a line of input from the file. For each line, it will print the value of `a - -b // 3` if `c` is not less than `b % 3`, otherwise it will print `-1`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will be updated for each line, but the final state of these variables after the loop will depend on the last line of input.**
