To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions and variables in the loop head. The loop head is:
```
for i in range(3, n + 1):
```
This loop will iterate over the range starting from 3 up to and including `n`. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 3. The variable `i` will start at 3.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will only execute if `n` is at least 3. The variable `i` will start at 3.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
