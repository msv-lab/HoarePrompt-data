To ensure the loop can execute, we need to focus on the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `ii` and `tt`. The loop will execute if `tt` is greater than 0. The variable `ii` will start at 0, as it is the initial value for the range function.

State: **`ii` is 0, `tt` must be greater than 0**
