The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns an iterator that converts each element from the input string, split by spaces, into a string. After the function concludes, the input string provided by the user is split into substrings based on spaces, and each substring is converted to a string. The final state of the program includes the returned iterator, which can be used to iterate over the converted substrings.
