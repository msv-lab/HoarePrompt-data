The function `func_14` accepts a list of integers `a`, a positive integer `n` representing the length of `a`, a positive integer `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and for each element that is less than `m`, it reduces `k` by the difference between `m` and that element. After the iteration, if `k` is greater than or equal to 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1. The final state of the program is that `k` is modified based on the elements of `a` that are less than `m`, and the function returns either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `k`.
