Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes no parameters and reads `n`, `k`, and `s` from user input. It processes the string `s` to find the `k`-th unique characters from the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. If the function finds at least `n` such `k`-th unique characters, it prints 'YES' and returns `None`. If fewer than `n` such characters are found, it prints 'NO' followed by a string that consists of the characters found in `ans`, the first unique character from `us` that is not in `win`, and then padded with `a` characters to reach a total length of `n`. The function does not modify the input variables `n`, `k`, `m`, or `s`. **
