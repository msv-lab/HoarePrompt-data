### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given an array `a` of length `n` where each element `a_i` is defined as `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`.
   - We need to reconstruct a permutation `p` of integers from `0` to `n-1` that satisfies this condition.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the array.
   - Given `a_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, we can rearrange this to find `p_i`:
     \[
     p_i = MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - a_i
     \]
   - We need to maintain the MEX of the prefix of `p` as we construct it.

3. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The program initializes `mex` to `n`, which is the highest possible MEX value for the permutation.
   - It iterates over the array `ar` in reverse order (from the last element to the first).
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `p_i` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - If `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`, it updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Correctness of the Algorithm:**
   - The program correctly calculates `p_i` using the formula `p_i = mex - ar[i]`.
   - The update condition `if mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that `mex` is always the smallest non-negative integer not in the prefix of `p` up to `i`.
   - By iterating in reverse, the program ensures that the MEX of the prefix is correctly maintained as it constructs the permutation.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `n = 1` correctly.
   - The program also handles the case where `a_i` values are negative or positive, as the MEX calculation and update are correctly managed.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the constructed permutation `p` for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly reconstructs a permutation `p` that satisfies the given condition for the array `a`. The logic and steps are sound and handle all edge cases as described in the problem.

### Correctness:
Correctness: **True**
