Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list of integers. Sorting is essential because it ensures that the smallest elements are paired first, which is necessary to maximize the score. By sorting the list, the program guarantees that the pairs are formed in a way that the minimum value of each pair is as large as possible.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the first number in each pair to the score. This approach is correct because, in a sorted list, the first number in each pair (i.e., the elements at even indices) is the minimum of that pair. By summing these minimum values, the program ensures that it is adding the smallest possible values from each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated score for each test case. This is consistent with the problem description, which requires the maximum score to be printed for each test case.

The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the `func` function:
- It reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and a list of `2n` integers.
- It sorts the list and calculates the sum of the first, third, fifth, ..., (2n-1)th smallest elements.
- It prints the calculated sum for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the original assessment is correct. The program follows the optimal strategy of always pairing the smallest available numbers first, which ensures the maximum possible score.

Final: **True**
