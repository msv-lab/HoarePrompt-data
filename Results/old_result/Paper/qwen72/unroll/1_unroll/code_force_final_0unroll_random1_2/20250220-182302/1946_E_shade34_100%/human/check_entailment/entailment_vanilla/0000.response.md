Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The problem involves counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that have specific indices for prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and the result should be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the length of the permutation \( n \), the number of prefix maximums \( m_1 \), and the number of suffix maximums \( m_2 \).
   - We are also given the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - The goal is to count the number of permutations that satisfy these conditions.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function appears to be an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \( c \) and \( d \) such that \( a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b) \).
     - However, the function is not directly used to solve the permutation problem. It is used to find the modular inverse in `func_2`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function computes the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - It uses `func_1` to find the coefficients and then returns the modular inverse.

3. **Algorithm for Counting Permutations:**
   - The key insight is that the prefix maximums and suffix maximums must be placed in specific positions in the permutation.
   - The prefix maximums must be in increasing order, and the suffix maximums must be in decreasing order.
   - The intersection of the prefix and suffix maximums must be the same element (the maximum of the permutation).

4. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program does not directly implement the algorithm for counting permutations based on the given conditions.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used in the context of solving the permutation problem.
   - There is no function or logic that processes the input indices of prefix and suffix maximums to count the permutations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The program does not contain any logic to solve the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to count the permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The functions provided are not used in the context of solving the problem.
