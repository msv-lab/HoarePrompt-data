The provided code snippet attempts to unpack the integer `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. However, since `a` is an integer, this operation will result in a `ValueError` because an integer is not iterable and cannot be unpacked in this way. Therefore, the code will raise an error and the values of `a` and `b` will remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers such that 3 <= a <= 99 and 3 <= b <= 99, and both `a` and `b` are odd. The code raises a `ValueError` because `a` cannot be unpacked into `x` and `y`.**
