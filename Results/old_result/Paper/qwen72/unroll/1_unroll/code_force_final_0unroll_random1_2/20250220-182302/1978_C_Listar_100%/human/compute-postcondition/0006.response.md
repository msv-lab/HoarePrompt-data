Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`, `n` is not equal to 0, `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, `func_5(l)` has been called.**

Explanation:
- `n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`.
- `n` is still not equal to 0.
- `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`.
- `func_5(l)` is called, but since the function does not return any value or modify any variables, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
