### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads the input from `open(0)`, which is a shorthand for reading from standard input.
   - It skips the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processes each subsequent line.
   - Each line is split into three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

2. **Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The program adds the number of universals `c` to the number of extroverts `b`. This is because universals can be used to fill the tents that extroverts require.
   - This step is correct because universals can be used to satisfy the extroverts' requirement of having exactly three people in a tent.

3. **Calculating the Minimum Number of Tents:**
   - The program calculates the minimum number of tents using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.
   - Let's break down this expression:
     - `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents required for extroverts.
     - `-b // 3` ensures that the result is always positive or zero (since `-b // 3` will round towards negative infinity).
     - `a - -b // 3` calculates the total number of tents needed. This is because each introvert needs a separate tent, and the number of tents required for extroverts is added to this count.
     - The expression `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the tents required for extroverts. If `c` is less than the remainder of `b` divided by 3, it means there are not enough universals to satisfy the extroverts' requirement, and the program outputs `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `c` is less than `b % 3`, the program correctly outputs `-1` because it is impossible to satisfy the extroverts' requirement.
   - If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all zero, the program correctly outputs `0` because no participants mean no tents are needed.
   - The program handles large inputs (up to \(10^9\)) efficiently.

5. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic of adding universals to the extroverts' count and then checking if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots is correct.
   - The use of `-b // 3` ensures that the number of tents required for extroverts is correctly calculated, even when `b` is negative (though `b` will always be non-negative in this problem).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed or outputs `-1` if it is impossible to satisfy the participants' preferences. The reasoning and logic are sound, and the program handles all edge cases as described in the problem.

**Correctness: True**
