The function `func` should accept parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the total number of vertices, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the number of additional vertices, and the list contains distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a value based on these inputs, but the specific return value is not provided in the output description.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a value based on these inputs, but the exact return value is not specified.**
