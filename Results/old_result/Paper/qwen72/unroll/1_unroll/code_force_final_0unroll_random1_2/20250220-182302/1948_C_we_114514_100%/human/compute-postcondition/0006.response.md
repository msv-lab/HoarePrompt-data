Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet to understand what will be printed.

### Initial State:
- `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4.
- `n` retains the value of the last input provided during the last iteration of the loop.
- `row1` and `row2` retain the values of the last inputs provided during the last iteration of the loop.
- `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration, with the number of elements equal to `t`.

### Code Snippet:
```python
print('\n'.join(results))
```

### Explanation:
- The `results` list contains `t` elements, where each element is the result of the function `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop.
- The `print` statement uses the `join` method to concatenate all elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).
- Therefore, the output will be a string where each line corresponds to one element of the `results` list.

### Output:
Output: **[result_1]
[result_2]
...
[result_t]**

Where:
- `result_1` is the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for the first iteration.
- `result_2` is the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for the second iteration.
- ...
- `result_t` is the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for the `t`-th iteration.

Each `result_i` is the value returned by `func_1(n, row1, row2)` during the `i`-th iteration of the loop. The exact values of `result_i` depend on the specific inputs provided to `func_1` during each iteration.
