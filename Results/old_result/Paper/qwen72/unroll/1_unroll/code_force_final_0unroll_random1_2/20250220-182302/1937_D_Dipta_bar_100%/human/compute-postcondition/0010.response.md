Output State: **`A` remains unchanged, `B` is a list where each element represents the cumulative count of '<' characters encountered, adjusted by their positions and the number of '<' characters seen so far, in reverse order, `idx_A` remains unchanged, `idx_B` is a list containing the indices of all '<' characters in the string `s`, in reverse order, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `B`.** 

The variable `r` is assigned the value of the length of the list `B`, while all other variables (`A`, `B`, `idx_A`, `idx_B`, and `l`) remain unchanged.
