Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The provided program has a few issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for every potential case:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city, but it is not correctly handling the logic. Specifically, the `prog_cities` array is being populated with the distance to the closest city, but it should store the index of the closest city.
   - The logic for determining the closest city is flawed. For example, in the line `if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):`, it should be checking the distance to the next city and the previous city, but it is not correctly handling the edge cases where `i` is 0 or `n-1`.

2. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are being populated with the distances to the closest cities, but they should be populated with the minimum number of coins required to travel to the closest city.
   - The prefix sum calculation is not correctly handling the logic of traveling to the closest city for each city.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program is not correctly handling the queries. It is using the prefix sum arrays to calculate the minimum number of coins, but the prefix sum arrays are not correctly representing the minimum cost to travel between cities.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because:
- `func_1` will not correctly determine the closest city for each city.
- The prefix sum arrays will not correctly represent the minimum cost to travel between cities.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Determine the closest city for each city.
2. Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel from any city to any other city.
3. Handle the queries efficiently using the precomputed minimum costs.

The provided program does not meet these requirements, hence it is incorrect.
