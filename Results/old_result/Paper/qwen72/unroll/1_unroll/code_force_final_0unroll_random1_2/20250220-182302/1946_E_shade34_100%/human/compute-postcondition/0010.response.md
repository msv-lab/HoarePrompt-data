Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that `a` >= `b` and `b` >= 0, and `b` is not equal to 0. Additionally, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`. `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.**

Explanation:
- The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
- `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by the function `func_1` with arguments `b` and `a % b`.
- Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a % b` is a non-zero integer less than `b`.
- The specific values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, but they are the results of `func_1(b, a % b)`.
