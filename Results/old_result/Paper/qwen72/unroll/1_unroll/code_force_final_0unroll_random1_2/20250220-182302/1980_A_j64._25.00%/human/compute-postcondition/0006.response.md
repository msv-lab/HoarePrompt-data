Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` and a list of tuples `test_cases`. Each tuple in `test_cases` contains two integers `n` and `m`, and a string `a` of `n` characters from 'A' to 'G'. The function returns a list `results` of `t` integers, where each integer represents the number of characters from 'A' to 'G' that need to be added to the corresponding string `a` to ensure each character appears at least `m` times. The original `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged after the function execution. **
