Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly determine the winner of the game for every potential case. One specific case where the program fails is when the input array has more than one pile, and all piles have the same number of stones. According to the problem description, if all piles have the same number of stones, Alice can win by removing all stones from each pile in her first turn. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this case.

For example, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
5
3 3 3 3 3
```
The expected output is "Alice" because Alice can remove 3 stones from each pile in her first turn, thus winning the game. However, the program will output "Bob" because it incorrectly checks the first element of the array and does not account for the possibility that all elements are the same and greater than 1.
