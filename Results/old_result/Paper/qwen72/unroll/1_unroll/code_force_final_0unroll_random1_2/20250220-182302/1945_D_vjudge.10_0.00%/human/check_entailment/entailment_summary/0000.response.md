Reasoning:  
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` in the queue. However, the logic used in the program does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, the program does not properly simulate the process of Kirill bribing people to move to a desired position. Instead, it seems to make some assumptions about the costs that are not aligned with the problem's constraints and requirements.

Here are the key issues:
1. **Incorrect Bribing Logic**: The program does not correctly simulate the process of Kirill bribing people to move to a position. It only considers the costs `a_values` and `b_values` in a linear manner, without properly accounting for the fact that Kirill can move to any position `j < i` and pay the corresponding costs.
2. **Cost Calculation**: The program's approach to calculating the cost is flawed. It does not consider the cumulative cost of moving through multiple positions, which is essential for the problem.
3. **Greedy Approach**: The program appears to use a greedy approach, but it does not ensure that Kirill reaches the optimal position with the minimum cost. The problem requires a more dynamic programming or priority queue approach to handle the complexity of the bribing process.

Given these issues, the program is not correct and will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
