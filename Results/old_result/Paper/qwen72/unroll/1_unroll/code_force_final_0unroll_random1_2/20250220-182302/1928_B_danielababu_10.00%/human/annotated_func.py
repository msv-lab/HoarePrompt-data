#State of the program right berfore the function call: None
def func_1():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns an integer value that the user inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and returns an integer value that the user inputs. After the function concludes, the program state includes the returned integer value, which is the result of converting the user's input to an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. The function does not take any parameters and is used to read input from the user, which is expected to be a sequence of integers separated by spaces.
def func_2():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that contains the sequence of integers input by the user, where each integer is converted from a string to an int.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` does not accept any parameters. It reads a sequence of integers from the user, where the integers are separated by spaces, and returns a map object containing the sequence of integers, each converted from a string to an int.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None. This function does not take any arguments and is intended to read input from the user, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, input().split()))
    #The program returns a list of integers, which are the space-separated numbers entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` does not accept any parameters. It reads a line of input from the user, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers, and returns a list of these integers. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has a list of integers derived from the user's input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables are passed to the function. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of integers.
def func_4():
    return sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of integers that were input as a space-separated list from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` reads a space-separated list of integers from the standard input, converts them to a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The function does not modify any external variables and operates solely on the input provided during the function call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No input variables are used in the function signature.
def func_5():
    return map(str, input().split())
    #The program returns an iterator that converts each element from the input string, split by spaces, into a string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts no parameters and returns an iterator that converts each element from the input string, split by spaces, into a string. After the function concludes, the input string provided by the user is split into substrings based on spaces, and each substring is converted to a string. The final state of the program includes the returned iterator, which can be used to iterate over the converted substrings.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: No variables are present in the function signature.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters from the input string provided by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and returns a list of characters from an input string provided by the user. After the function concludes, the input string is transformed into a list where each character of the string becomes an individual element in the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are used. The function reads input from the standard input, which is expected to be a space-separated list of strings that can be converted to integers.
def func_7():
    return sorted(list(map(str, input().split())))
    #The program returns a sorted list of strings, where each string represents an integer that was input as part of a space-separated list from the standard input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_7` reads a space-separated list of strings from the standard input, converts each string to an integer, sorts the integers, and returns the sorted list as strings. The function does not modify any external variables and does not have any side effects. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the function has returned a sorted list of strings, where each string represents an integer from the input.

    ans = []
    tem = 1
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        tem *= arr[i]

    #State: Output State: `arr` remains a list of positive integers, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`, and `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the list `ans`, which contains the cumulative products of the elements in the list `arr`. Each element in `ans` represents the product of all elements in `arr` up to that point.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_8` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans`. The list `ans` contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`. Each element in `ans` represents the product of all elements in `arr` from the start up to the current index. The original list `arr` remains unchanged.

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers, `ans` is a list of the cumulative products of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element to the first, `tem` is the product of all elements in `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` that contains the cumulative products of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element to the first.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_9` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns a new list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element to the first. After the function concludes, `arr` remains unchanged, and `ans` contains the cumulative products in reverse order.
