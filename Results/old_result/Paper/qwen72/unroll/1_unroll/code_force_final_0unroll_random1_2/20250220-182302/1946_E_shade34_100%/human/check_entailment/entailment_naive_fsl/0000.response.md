Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not solve the problem as described. The problem requires counting the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. However, the functions provided are related to the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and modular arithmetic, which do not address the permutation counting problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the given problem description.
