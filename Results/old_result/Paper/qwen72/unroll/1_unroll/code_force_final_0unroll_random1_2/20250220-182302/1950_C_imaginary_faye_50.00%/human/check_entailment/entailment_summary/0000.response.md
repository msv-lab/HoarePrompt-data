Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` reads the number of test cases and then processes each time string individually.
- For each time string, it extracts the hour (`h`) and minute (`mm`) parts.
- The function correctly handles the special case where the hour is `00` by converting it to `12` and appending "AM".
- For hours between `01` and `11`, it simply prints the hour as is and appends "AM".
- For hours between `13` and `23`, it subtracts 12 from the hour, formats it with a leading zero if necessary, and appends "PM".
- The function correctly handles the boundary cases where the hour is `12` (which should remain `12` and append "PM") and `00` (which should be converted to `12` and append "AM").
- The function prints the minutes part as is, which is correct since the minutes format is the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.
- The function uses a list `['AM', 'PM']` to determine whether to append "AM" or "PM" based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the function `func_1` appears to correctly convert the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format and handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
