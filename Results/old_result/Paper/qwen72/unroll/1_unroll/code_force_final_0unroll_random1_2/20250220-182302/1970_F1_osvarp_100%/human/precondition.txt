N and M are odd integers such that 3 <= N, M <= 99; P is an integer such that 1 <= P <= 10; T is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= T <= 10000. The field is represented as a 2D list of N rows and M columns, where each cell contains a pair of characters representing an empty cell (..), a player (R0 to R9, B0 to B9), a goal (RG, BG), or the Quaffle (.Q). The Quaffle is present exactly once on the field. The number of goals for each team is between 1 and 5. The actions list contains T lines, each describing a valid action by a player or the Quaffle.
