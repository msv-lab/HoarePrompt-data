Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed. The function `func_1` determines the winner based on whether the sum of the coins in both wallets is even or odd. However, this is not the correct approach to determine the winner of the game.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the winner, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Condition**: If both wallets have the same number of coins, the player who starts (Alice) will always lose because the game will end in a tie, and the player who cannot make a move loses.
2. **Optimal Play**: If the number of coins in the wallets is different, the player with more coins can always force a win by reducing the number of coins in the opponent's wallet to 1 and then maintaining a strategy to keep the opponent's wallet at 1 while reducing their own wallet to 0.

### Correct Logic:
- If `a == b`, Bob wins.
- If `a > b`, Alice wins.
- If `a < b`, Bob wins.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    if a == b:
        return 'Bob'
    else:
        return 'Alice'

def func_2():
    t = int(input('Enter the number of test cases: '))
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        winner = func_1(a, b)
        results.append(winner)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected program will correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy.
