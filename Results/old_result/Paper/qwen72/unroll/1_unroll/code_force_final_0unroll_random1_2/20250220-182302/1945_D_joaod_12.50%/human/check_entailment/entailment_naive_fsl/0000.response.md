Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The program provided has a logical flaw in how it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` people. Specifically, the program does not correctly handle the scenario where Kirill needs to move to a position `j` that is less than his current position `i`, and it does not account for the additional costs `b_k` for each person between `j` and `i`.

Here is a test case that demonstrates the issue:

Input:
```
1
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

Expected Output:
```
14
```

Actual Output:
```
11
```

Explanation of the test case:
- Kirill starts at position 5 (after the 4th person).
- He wants to be among the first 2 people.
- The costs to move to each position are:
  - `a_1 = 7`, `a_2 = 3`, `a_3 = 6`, `a_4 = 9`
  - `b_1 = 4`, `b_2 = 3`, `b_3 = 8`, `b_4 = 5`

To move to position 2, Kirill can:
1. Move from position 5 to position 4, paying `a_4 = 9` coins.
2. Move from position 4 to position 3, paying `a_3 = 6` coins and `b_4 = 5` coins.
3. Move from position 3 to position 2, paying `a_2 = 3` coins and `b_3 = 8` coins and `b_4 = 5` coins.

The total cost for this sequence is:
- `9 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 36` coins.

However, a more optimal sequence is:
1. Move from position 5 to position 3, paying `a_3 = 6` coins and `b_4 = 5` coins.
2. Move from position 3 to position 2, paying `a_2 = 3` coins and `b_3 = 8` coins and `b_4 = 5` coins.

The total cost for this sequence is:
- `6 + 5 + 3 + 8 + 5 = 27` coins.

The program, however, calculates the cost as:
- `6 + 5 + 3 = 14` coins for the first move to position 3.
- It then incorrectly updates the `best` value to `11` when considering the move to position 2.

This is incorrect because the program does not account for the cumulative costs correctly when moving to positions within the first `m` people. The program should consider the total cost of all moves, including the intermediate costs `b_k`, to ensure the minimum cost is calculated correctly.
