### Reasoning:

1. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation of length `n` can only be even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`. For an even `n`, `max_k` is `n^2 // 2`, and for an odd `n`, `max_k` is `(n^2 - 1) // 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)` because no permutation can achieve a Manhattan value greater than `max_k`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k` unchanged.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function initializes a list `l` with a sequence of integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates over the list in reverse, decrementing `k` and swapping elements to achieve the required Manhattan value.
   - If `k` becomes 0 during the loop, it returns the current state of `l`.
   - If `k` is less than `i - 1` at any point, it calls `func_2` to perform a specific swap and returns the result.
   - If the loop completes, it returns the final state of `l`.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` in the list `l`.
   - It ensures that the swap is performed correctly and returns the modified list `l`.

4. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function swaps the elements at indices `c-1` and `-c` in the list `l`.
   - It ensures that the swap is performed correctly and returns the modified list `l`.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function prints "YES" and the elements of the list `l` in the same order, separated by spaces.
   - It ensures that the output format is correct and returns `None`.

6. **Function 6 (`func_6`)**:
   - This function calls `func_4` to get `n` and `k`.
   - If `n` is 0, it prints "NO" and exits.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k` to get a permutation `l` and then calls `func_5` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- **Input Validation**: `func_4` correctly validates the input and ensures that `k` is even and within the possible range for the given `n`.
- **Permutation Generation**: `func_1` generates a permutation by iteratively swapping elements to achieve the required Manhattan value. The logic for swapping and decrementing `k` is correct.
- **Output**: `func_5` correctly prints the permutation in the required format.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where no permutation can achieve the required Manhattan value by returning "NO".

### Conclusion:
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all edge cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
