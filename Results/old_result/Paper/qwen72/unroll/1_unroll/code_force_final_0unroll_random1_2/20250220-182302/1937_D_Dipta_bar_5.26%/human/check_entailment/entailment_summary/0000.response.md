### Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the number of seconds it takes for a pinball to leave the grid when placed on each cell, given the initial configuration of the grid. The pinball moves according to the direction of the character in the cell it is placed on, and the character is inverted after each move. The pinball stops when it leaves the grid from either the left or the right border.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by precomputing two arrays, `A` and `B`, which store the cumulative number of steps required for the pinball to move to the right and to the left, respectively, from each cell. These arrays are then used to calculate the final number of seconds for each cell.

However, the program's logic and the execution summary provided do not match the problem description. The execution summary mentions that the function `func_1` prints the number of balanced pairs of '<' and '>', which is not the correct behavior for this problem. The function should print the number of seconds it takes for the pinball to leave the grid, not the number of balanced pairs.

Let's break down the program to identify the issues:

1. **Array `A` and `B` Calculation:**
   - `A` is supposed to store the cumulative number of steps required for the pinball to move to the right from each cell that contains '>'.
   - `B` is supposed to store the cumulative number of steps required for the pinball to move to the left from each cell that contains '<'.

2. **Output Calculation:**
   - The program uses a complex set of conditions to calculate the number of seconds for each cell. However, these conditions are not clearly aligned with the problem's requirements.
   - The program uses `a` and `b` variables to store intermediate results, but the logic for calculating these values is not straightforward and seems to be incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program's logic for calculating the number of seconds is overly complex and does not follow the straightforward rules of the problem.
   - The use of `A` and `B` arrays and the conditions for updating `a` and `b` are not aligned with the problem's requirements of simulating the pinball's movement and inversion of characters.

4. **Expected Behavior:**
   - For each cell, the program should simulate the pinball's movement and count the number of seconds until it leaves the grid.
   - The program should handle the inversion of characters correctly and ensure that the pinball moves according to the rules provided in the problem.

Given the mismatch between the problem's requirements and the program's logic, the program is incorrect.
