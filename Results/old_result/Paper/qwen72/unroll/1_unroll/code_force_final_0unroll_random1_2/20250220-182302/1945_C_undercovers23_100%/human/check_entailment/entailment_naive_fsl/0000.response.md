Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house (output 0) or after the last house (output n) correctly. Specifically, the program only checks for positions between houses and does not consider the edge cases where the road is laid before the first house or after the last house. This can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3
000
```
The correct output should be `0` because the road should be laid before the first house to satisfy the condition. However, the program will not output `0` in this case because it only checks positions between houses and does not consider the possibility of laying the road before the first house.
