Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and `T` is a type variable. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.**
