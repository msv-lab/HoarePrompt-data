### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n` and two strings `row1` and `row2` from standard input.
   - It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and appends the result to a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints each result in the list `results` on a new line.
   - This matches the problem's input and output requirements.

2. **Path Checking (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) from (1, 1).
   - It checks the configuration of arrows in the grid:
     - It iterates over the first half of the columns (since `n` is even, `n // 2` is an integer).
     - For each column `i` in the first half, it checks if the robot can move to the next column:
       - If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is '<' and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is '<', the robot cannot move to the next column, and the function returns 'No'.
     - It also checks the last column:
       - If `row1[n - 1]` is '<' and `row2[n - 2]` is '<', the robot cannot reach the last column, and the function returns 'No'.
     - If none of these conditions are met, the function returns 'Yes'.
   - This logic ensures that the robot can move through the grid without being blocked by arrows pointing to the left.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first test case (n=4, row1=">><<", row2=">>><"):
     - The robot can move from (1, 1) to (1, 2) to (1, 3) to (2, 3) to (2, 4).
     - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.
   - For the second test case (n=2, row1="><", row2="><"):
     - The robot can move from (1, 1) to (2, 1) to (2, 2).
     - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.
   - For the third test case (n=4, row1=">>><", row2=">><<"):
     - The robot cannot move from (1, 3) to (2, 3) because `row1[3]` is '<' and `row2[2]` is '<'.
     - The function correctly returns 'No'.
   - For the fourth test case (n=6, row1=">><<><", row2="><>>><"):
     - The robot can move from (1, 1) to (2, 1) to (2, 2) to (1, 2) to (1, 3) to (2, 3) to (2, 4) to (2, 5) to (2, 6).
     - The function correctly returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem. The logic in `func_1` ensures that the robot can reach the cell (2, n) if the grid configuration allows it. The examples provided also match the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
