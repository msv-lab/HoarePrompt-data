Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, the tree is represented by a list of n-1 edges where each edge is a tuple (u, v) with 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the tree has exactly two leaves, the initial node for the game is an integer `u_1` such that 1 ≤ `u_1` ≤ n, `x` and `y` are input integers, `lst` is a defaultdict of lists, `rev` is a defaultdict of lists.** 

The code initializes a new defaultdict `rev` with lists as the default factory. This does not change the values of `n`, the tree representation, `u_1`, `x`, `y`, or `lst`. The only change is the creation of the new defaultdict `rev`.
