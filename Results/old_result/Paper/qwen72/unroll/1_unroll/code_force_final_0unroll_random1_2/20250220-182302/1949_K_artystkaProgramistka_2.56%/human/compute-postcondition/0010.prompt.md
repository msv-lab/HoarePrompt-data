You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, na, nb, and nc are positive integers such that 3 <= n <= 200,000, 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2, and na + nb + nc = n. numbers is a list of n positive integers where 1 <= numbers[i] <= 10^9.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain the same. `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing the numbers from the `numbers` list distributed such that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`, while also ensuring that the lengths of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively. `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the numbers in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. Each list contains numbers from the original `numbers` list, distributed such that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`, while also ensuring that the lengths of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `numbers`, and returns 'YES' along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` if the numbers can be distributed into these groups such that the lengths are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively, and the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`. If such a distribution is not possible, it returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', along with the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. Each list contains numbers from the original `numbers` list, distributed such that the sum of the numbers in `group_a` is as close as possible to the sum of the numbers in `group_b` and `group_c`, while also ensuring that the lengths of `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are `na`, `nb`, and `nc` respectively.

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
