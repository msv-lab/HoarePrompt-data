Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 0 <= `l` <= `r` < `n`, `a` is a list of integers where each element `a_i` satisfies 0 <= `a_i` <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that will store the operations as tuples (`l`, `r`), `s` is the sum of the elements in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `pos` is the index of `mx` in the original list `a`. If `pos` is not equal to `r`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum` is called with `l` = `pos + 1` and `r` = `r`. If `pos` is equal to `r`, no further recursive call is made.***
