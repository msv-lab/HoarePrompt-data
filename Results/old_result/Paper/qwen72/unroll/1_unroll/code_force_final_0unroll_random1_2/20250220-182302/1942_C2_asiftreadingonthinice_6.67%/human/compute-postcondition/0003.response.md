The function `max_triangles` accepts five parameters: `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. 

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
- `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9).
- `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5)).
- `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of other vertices you can choose (0 ≤ y ≤ n - x).
- `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

The function returns the maximum number of non-overlapping triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and the additional vertices you can select, for each test case.
