You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Program:
func_1()

def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` processes a series of time strings provided by the user in the format "hh:mm" (where `hh` is an integer from 00 to 23 and `mm` is an integer from 00 to 59). For each input time string, it converts the time to a 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" based on the hour. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the converted time strings directly to the console. The original input time strings are not modified or stored.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t` using `int(input())`.
   - It then iterates `t` times to process each test case.

2. **Time Parsing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the time string `s` which is in the format `hh:mm`.
   - It extracts the hour part `h` using `s[:2]`.

3. **Hour Conversion:**
   - If the hour `h` is `00`, it prints `12` (since 00:00 in 24-hour format is 12:00 AM in 12-hour format).
   - If the hour `h` is less than or equal to `12`, it prints the hour as is.
   - If the hour `h` is greater than `12`, it subtracts `12` from the hour and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary using `print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')`.

4. **Minute and AM/PM Handling:**
   - It prints the minute part `s[2:]` directly.
   - It determines whether to print `AM` or `PM` based on whether the hour `h` is greater than or equal to `12`.

### Analysis of the Code:

- **Hour Conversion:**
  - The code correctly handles the conversion of hours from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
  - For `00`, it correctly prints `12`.
  - For hours `01` to `12`, it prints the hour as is.
  - For hours `13` to `23`, it correctly subtracts `12` and prints the result with a leading zero if necessary.

- **Minute Handling:**
  - The code correctly prints the minute part `s[2:]` without any modifications, which is appropriate since the minute format is the same in both 24-hour and 12-hour formats.

- **AM/PM Determination:**
  - The code correctly determines whether to print `AM` or `PM` based on the hour value.

### Edge Cases:

- **Midnight (00:00):**
  - The code correctly converts `00:00` to `12:00 AM`.

- **Noon (12:00):**
  - The code correctly converts `12:00` to `12:00 PM`.

- **Hours 13 to 23:**
  - The code correctly converts hours `13` to `23` to their 12-hour format equivalents and appends `PM`.

- **Hours 01 to 11:**
  - The code correctly converts hours `01` to `11` to their 12-hour format equivalents and appends `AM`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly converts the time from 24-hour format to 12-hour format and handles all edge cases as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
