The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the user, which represents the number of test cases. It then precomputes a list `pd` of length 200001, where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 <= i < 200001) is the sum of all previous elements in the list plus the sum of the digits of the integer `i`. For each of the `t` test cases, the function reads another integer `n` from the user and prints the value of `pd[n]`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value, but the list `pd` and the integer `N` (which is 200001) remain in their final computed states. The integer `t` remains the same as the initial input, and `n` is the last input value provided by the user.
