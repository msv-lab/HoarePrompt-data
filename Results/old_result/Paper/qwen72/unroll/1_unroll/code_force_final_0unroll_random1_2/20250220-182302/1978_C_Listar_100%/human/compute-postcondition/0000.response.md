Output State: **`n` and `k` are updated to the values returned by `func_4()`.** 

Natural language description: The values of `n` and `k` are now the values returned by the function `func_4()`. The specific values of `n` and `k` after this update depend on what `func_4()` returns, but they will still satisfy the conditions that `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5` and `0 <= k <= 10^12`.
