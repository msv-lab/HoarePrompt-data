### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which is the largest number Vladislav writes.

2. **Precomputation**:
   - The program initializes a list `pd` of size `N` (which is 200001) with all elements set to 0.
   - It then iterates through each integer `i` from 1 to `N-1` and computes the sum of the digits of `i`.
   - The sum of the digits of `i` is added to `pd[i]`.
   - Additionally, `pd[i]` is updated to be the cumulative sum of the sums of the digits from 1 to `i`.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads the integer `n` and prints `pd[n]`, which is the precomputed sum of the sums of the digits from 1 to `n`.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The precomputation step correctly calculates the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200000 and stores the cumulative sum in `pd`.
   - The query processing step correctly retrieves the precomputed sum for each test case.
   - The program handles the constraints efficiently, as the precomputation is done in O(N) time and each query is answered in O(1) time.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the smallest possible value of `n` (1) and the largest possible value of `n` (200000).
   - The program also correctly handles the maximum number of test cases (10000).

### Conclusion:
The program is correct and efficiently solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
