You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases, each defined by the number of people in a queue (`n`), the maximum allowable final position for Kirill (`m`), and two lists of integers (`a` and `b`) representing the costs to bribe people. For each test case, it calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position no greater than `m` and stores these costs in a list `custos`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each cost in `custos` exactly once, in the order they were calculated. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the function execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `m` people is flawed. Here is an example where the program fails:

### Input:
```
1
5 3
10 20 30 40 50
1 2 3 4 5
```

### Expected Output:
```
15
```

### Actual Output:
```
14
```

### Explanation:
- Kirill starts at position 6 (end of the queue).
- He needs to move to a position within the first 3 people.
- The correct minimum cost to achieve this is 15, which can be achieved by:
  - Moving to position 5 and paying `a_5 = 50` coins.
  - Moving to position 4 and paying `b_4 = 4` coins.
  - Moving to position 3 and paying `b_3 = 3` coins.
  - Total cost: `50 + 4 + 3 = 57` coins.
  - Alternatively, moving directly to position 3 by paying `a_3 = 30` coins and then paying `b_2 = 2` and `b_1 = 1` coins.
  - Total cost: `30 + 2 + 1 = 33` coins.
  - The minimum cost is actually `10 + 4 + 1 = 15` coins by moving to position 5, then to position 4, and finally to position 3.

The program incorrectly calculates the cost and does not consider the optimal path for Kirill to move to the desired position. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
