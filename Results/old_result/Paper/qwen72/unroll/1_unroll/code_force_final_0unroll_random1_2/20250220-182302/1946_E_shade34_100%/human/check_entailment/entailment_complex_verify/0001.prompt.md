You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c` as they were returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`, where `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with `a` being less than `b`, and `b` is not equal to 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` where `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `b` is greater than or equal to 0. It returns a tuple `(x, y)` based on the following conditions:
1. If `b` is 0, the function returns `(1, 0)`.
2. If `a` is less than `b` and `b` is not 0, the function returns the values of `d` and `c` as they were returned by the function `func_1(b, a)`, swapping their positions.
3. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is divisible by `b`, the function returns `(1, -(a // b - 1))`.
4. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b`, the function returns `(d, c - a // b * d)`, where `d` and `c` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a % b)`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts an integer `a` and a list of integers `b` (with a minimum length of 1). It returns the result of `(c * a) % 1000000007`, where `c` is a value obtained from calling `func_1(b, 1000000007)`. The function does not modify the input parameters `a` or `b`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it correctly solves the problem as described. The problem involves counting the number of permutations of length \( n \) that have specific indices for prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and the result should be modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given the length of the permutation \( n \), the number of prefix maximums \( m_1 \), and the number of suffix maximums \( m_2 \).
   - We are also given the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.
   - The goal is to count the number of permutations that satisfy these conditions.

2. **Analyzing the Functions:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):**
     - This function appears to be an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which is used to find the coefficients \( c \) and \( d \) such that \( a \cdot c + b \cdot d = \gcd(a, b) \).
     - However, the function is not directly used to solve the permutation problem. It is used to find the modular inverse in `func_2`.

   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):**
     - This function computes the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
     - It uses `func_1` to find the coefficients and then returns the modular inverse.

3. **Algorithm for Counting Permutations:**
   - The key insight is that the prefix maximums and suffix maximums must be placed in specific positions in the permutation.
   - The prefix maximums must be in increasing order, and the suffix maximums must be in decreasing order.
   - The intersection of the prefix and suffix maximums must be the same element (the maximum of the permutation).

4. **Checking the Program:**
   - The program does not directly implement the algorithm for counting permutations based on the given conditions.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not used in the context of solving the permutation problem.
   - There is no function or logic that processes the input indices of prefix and suffix maximums to count the permutations.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not relevant to the problem of counting permutations with specific prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The program does not contain any logic to solve the given problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to count the permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The functions provided are not used in the context of solving the problem.
