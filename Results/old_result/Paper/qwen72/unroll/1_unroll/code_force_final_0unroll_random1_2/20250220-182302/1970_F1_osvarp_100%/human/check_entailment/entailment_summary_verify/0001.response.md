### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the grid `(n, m)` and the grid itself.
   - It initializes the `elements` dictionary to store the positions of all entities on the grid.
   - It correctly identifies players and stores their initial positions in the `allPlayers` dictionary, setting their carrying status to `False`.
   - It correctly identifies goals and stores their positions in the `goal` list.

2. **Grid Initialization:**
   - The program iterates through the grid to populate the `elements` dictionary with the initial positions of all entities.
   - It correctly identifies players and goals and initializes the necessary data structures.

3. **Action Processing:**
   - The program reads the number of steps `t` and then processes each action.
   - For actions with three elements (indicating a catch or a throw), it correctly updates the player's carrying status and handles the catch of the Quaffle.
   - For actions with two elements (indicating a move), it correctly updates the position of the entity performing the action.
   - The program checks if a player throws the Quaffle into a goal and updates the score accordingly. It correctly prints the scoring event and the final score.

4. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The `goalIn` function correctly determines which team's goal a position corresponds to.
   - The program correctly handles the case where a player scores in the wrong goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - The Quaffle is correctly reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

5. **Issues:**
   - **Bludger Elimination:**
     - The program includes logic for handling bludgers (`.B`) and player eliminations, which is not part of the problem description for the current version. This should be removed to match the problem requirements.
   - **Golden Snitch:**
     - The program includes logic for handling the golden snitch (`.S`), which is also not part of the problem description for the current version. This should be removed.

### Corrected Program:
```python
from sys import stdin

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]
    GoalName = ['RED', 'BLUE']
    mov = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}

    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        grid.append(line)
        for ind in range(len(line)):
            if line[ind] != '..':
                elements[line[ind]] = (i, ind)
                if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                    allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
                elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                    tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                    goal[tmp].append((i, ind))
    
    t = int(stdin.readline().strip())
    for time in range(t):
        comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        if len(comand) == 3:
            (obj, com, el) = comand
            if el == '.Q':
                allPlayers[obj] = True
        else:
            (obj, com) = comand
            pos = elements[obj]
            nxt = (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])
            elements[obj] = nxt
            if isPlayer(obj) and com == 'T':
                allPlayers[obj] = False
                if goalIn(nxt) != -1:
                    team = goalIn(nxt)
                    print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[1 - team]))
                    points[1 - team] += 1
                    elements['.Q'] = ((n + 1) // 2 - 1, (m + 1) // 2 - 1)
    
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))

def goalIn(pos):
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res

def isPlayer(el):
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res

# Example usage
# func_1()
```

### Final Evaluation:
- **True** if the program is modified to remove the bludger and golden snitch logic.
- **False** if the program is not modified to remove the bludger and golden snitch logic.

Given the issues identified, the original program is **incorrect** for the current problem description.

Final: **False**
