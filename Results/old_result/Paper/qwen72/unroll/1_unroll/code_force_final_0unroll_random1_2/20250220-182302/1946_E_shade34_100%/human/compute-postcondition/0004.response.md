To properly execute the code snippet and provide the output state, we need to know the definition of `func_1`. Since `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, I will assume a generic function that returns two values based on the inputs `b` and `a`. However, without the specific implementation of `func_1`, I can only describe the output state in terms of the returned values `c` and `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is not equal to 0.

The code snippet:
```
c, d = func_1(b, a)
```

Impact of the code:
- `c` and `d` are assigned the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.

Since the specific values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, the output state will include the updated values of `c` and `d` based on the function's return.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers such that `a` is less than `b`, and `b` is not equal to 0; `c` and `d` are the values returned by `func_1(b, a)`.**
