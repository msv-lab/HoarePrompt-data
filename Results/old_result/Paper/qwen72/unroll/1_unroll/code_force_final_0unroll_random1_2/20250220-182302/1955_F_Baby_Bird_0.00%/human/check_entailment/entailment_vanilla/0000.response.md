### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
   - Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
   - Eve can remove numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
   - The sequence consists of integers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2. **Bitwise XOR Properties:**
   - The XOR of a number with itself is zero: \( x \oplus x = 0 \).
   - The XOR of a number with zero is the number itself: \( x \oplus 0 = x \).
   - The XOR of a sequence of numbers is zero if and only if the number of 1s, 3s, and the total number of 2s and 4s are all even.

3. **Optimal Removal Strategy:**
   - Eve should remove numbers to make the XOR zero as often as possible.
   - Removing a number changes the parity (odd/even) of the count of that number.
   - If the counts of 1s, 3s, and the total of 2s and 4s are all even, the XOR is zero, and Bob wins.
   - If any of these counts is odd, the XOR is non-zero, and Alice wins.

4. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads four integers \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4 \) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s.
   - It then processes these counts to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.

5. **Key Steps in the Program:**
   - `p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))`: This step converts each count to the largest even number less than or equal to it. This is because removing an even number of any type of number does not change the parity of the total count.
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3`: This checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, Bob wins once before any removals.
   - `print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)`: This prints the number of times Bob can win. The `sum(p) // 2` part calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even, which is the number of times Bob can win.

6. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly identifies the initial condition where Bob wins if all counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are odd.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs that can be removed to make the counts even, which is the number of times Bob can win.
   - The logic of converting each count to the largest even number and then summing the pairs is correct for determining the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the given problem description and constraints.
