Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this sum, we need to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The best way to do this is to sort the array in ascending order and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the program provided does not compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Instead, it simply prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the sorted array. This is incorrect because the maximum beauty is not just the difference between the largest and smallest elements, but the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements in the sorted array.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the example test case:
- Input: `3 2 1 3`
- The sorted array is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The correct maximum beauty is \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2\).
- The program will output `3 - 1 = 2`, which is correct in this specific case, but this is a coincidence.

For another example:
- Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
- The sorted array is `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
- The correct maximum beauty is \((3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1\).
- The program will output `4 - 3 = 1`, which is correct in this specific case, but again, this is a coincidence.

For a more general case:
- Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
- The sorted array is `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
- The correct maximum beauty is \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
- The program will output `100 - 43 = 57`, which is correct, but this is not the correct approach.

The correct approach should be to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. The program provided does not do this, and hence it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
