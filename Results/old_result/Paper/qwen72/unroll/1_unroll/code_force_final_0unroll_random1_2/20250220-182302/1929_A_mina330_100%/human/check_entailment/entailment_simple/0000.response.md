Reasoning:

The problem requires calculating the maximum beauty of an array after rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements from the second element to the last element.

To maximize the beauty, the differences between consecutive elements should be maximized. Sorting the array and then computing the difference between the largest and smallest elements (i.e., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[0]`) does not correctly compute the sum of the differences between all consecutive pairs. Instead, the correct approach is to sort the array and then compute the sum of the differences between each consecutive pair in the sorted array.

The given program sorts the array but only prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which is not the correct way to compute the maximum beauty. The correct computation should be:

\[ \text{Beauty} = (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1}) \]

This can be simplified to:

\[ \text{Beauty} = a_n - a_1 \]

However, the program should sum the differences between all consecutive pairs, not just the difference between the first and last elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
