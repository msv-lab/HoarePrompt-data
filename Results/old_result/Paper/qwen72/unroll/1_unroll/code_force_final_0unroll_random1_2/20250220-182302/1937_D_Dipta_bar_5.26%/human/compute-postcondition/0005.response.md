Output State: **`A` is a list containing the cumulative counts of '>' characters from the start of the string `s` up to each position where a '>' character is found, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in the string `s`, and `B` is an empty list.** 

The code initializes an empty list `B`, but does not modify the existing lists `A` and `idx_A`. Therefore, the initial state of `A` and `idx_A` remains unchanged, and `B` is now an empty list.
