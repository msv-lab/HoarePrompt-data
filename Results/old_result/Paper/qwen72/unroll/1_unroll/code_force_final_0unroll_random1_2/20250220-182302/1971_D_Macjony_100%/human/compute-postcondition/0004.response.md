Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads a binary string `s` from the input. It then calculates and prints the number of alternating character sequences in `s`, adjusting the count by subtracting 1 if the sequence contains a '0' followed by a '1'. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case. After the function concludes, the input has been processed for `t` test cases, and the final state of the program includes the printed counts for each test case. **
