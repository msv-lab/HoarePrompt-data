You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:
t = 7
cas_de_test = [(0, 0, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 2, 3), (3, 3, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 1, 10), (0, 0, 6)]
resultats = func_1(t, cas_de_test)
print('\n'.join(map(str, resultats)))

def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        total_matchs = total_points // 2
        if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)
        if egalites < 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
        else:
            resultats.append(egalites // 2)
    return resultats



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) and a list of tuples `cas_de_test`, where each tuple contains three integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` (0 <= p_1 <= p_2 <= p_3 <= 30). It processes each tuple to determine the number of draws based on specific conditions and returns a list `resultats` where each element is either -1 (indicating an invalid condition) or the calculated number of draws. The final state of the program includes the original `t` and `cas_de_test` unchanged, and `resultats` containing the results of the draw calculations for each tuple in `cas_de_test`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases. The variable `t` is the number of test cases, and `cas_de_test` is a list of tuples representing the scores for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with `t` and `cas_de_test` as arguments, and the results are printed in the required format.

2. **Total Points Check:**
   - The program checks if the total points (`total_points = p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. This is correct because each game (whether it ends in a win/loss or a draw) always adds an even number of points to the total score.
   - If the total points are odd, the program appends `-1` to the results, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.

3. **Total Matches Check:**
   - The program calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs = total_points // 2`). This is correct because each match (regardless of the result) adds 2 points to the total score.
   - The program then checks if `total_matchs` is greater than 3 or if `p3` (the highest score) is greater than `total_matchs`. This is incorrect. The number of matches should not be limited to 3, as the problem does not specify this constraint. Additionally, `p3` can be equal to `total_matchs` if all games ended in draws.

4. **Draws Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula is derived from the idea that the difference in points between the highest and the other two players can be attributed to wins and losses, and the remaining points can be attributed to draws.
   - The program then checks if `egalites` is negative. If it is, it appends `-1` to the results, indicating that the scores are not consistent with any valid set of games.
   - If `egalites` is non-negative, it appends `egalites // 2` to the results, which is the number of draws.

5. **Edge Cases and Examples:**
   - For the test case `(0, 0, 0)`, the program correctly returns `0` because no games were played.
   - For the test case `(0, 1, 1)`, the program correctly returns `1` because one game ended in a draw.
   - For the test case `(1, 1, 1)`, the program incorrectly returns `-1` because it should be possible for all three players to have 1 point each if there was one draw and two losses.
   - For the test case `(1, 1, 2)`, the program correctly returns `2` because two games could have ended in draws.
   - For the test case `(3, 3, 3)`, the program incorrectly returns `-1` because it should be possible for all three players to have 3 points each if there were three draws.
   - For the test case `(3, 4, 5)`, the program correctly returns `6` because six games could have ended in draws.
   - For the test case `(1, 1, 10)`, the program correctly returns `2` because two games could have ended in draws.

### Correctness:
The program is **incorrect** due to the following issues:
- The check `if total_matchs > 3 or p3 > total_matchs` is too restrictive and does not align with the problem statement. The number of matches is not limited to 3, and `p3` can be equal to `total_matchs` if all games ended in draws.
- The program fails to handle cases like `(1, 1, 1)` and `(3, 3, 3)` correctly, where the scores are consistent with a valid set of games but the program returns `-1`.

### Correctness: **False**
