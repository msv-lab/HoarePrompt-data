### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes `count` to 2 and `ans` to `n`.
   - It then enters a loop where it increments `count` from 2 to `m`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates `countmins` as `count - 1` and `g` as `n // count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, it breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `g` by subtracting `countmins` and then adds \((g // count) + 1\) to `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - The condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) can be rewritten as \(a + b = k \cdot b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) for some integer \(k\).
   - This implies that \(a = b \cdot (k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1)\).
   - For \(a\) to be an integer, \(k \cdot \gcd(a, b) - 1\) must be an integer, and \(a\) must be a multiple of \(b\).

4. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop starts with `count = 2` and iterates up to `m`.
   - The variable `countmins` is set to `count - 1`.
   - The variable `g` is set to `n // count`, which is the integer division of `n` by `count`.
   - If `g` is less than `countmins`, the loop breaks. This is a valid condition because if `g` is less than `count - 1`, it means there are no more valid pairs for the current `count`.
   - The expression `g -= countmins` ensures that `g` is adjusted correctly.
   - The expression `ans += g // count + 1` adds the number of valid pairs for the current `count` to `ans`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - For the first test case \((1, 1)\), the only valid pair is \((1, 1)\), and the output is 1, which is correct.
   - For the fourth test case \((10, 8)\), the valid pairs are \((1,1)\), \((2,1)\), \((2,2)\), \((3,1)\), \((4,1)\), \((5,1)\), \((6,1)\), \((6,2)\), \((6,3)\), \((7,1)\), \((8,1)\), \((9,1)\), \((10,1)\), \((10,2)\), and the output is 14, which is correct.

6. **General Correctness**:
   - The logic in the loop correctly identifies and counts the valid pairs for each `count` from 2 to `m`.
   - The initial value of `ans` being set to `n` accounts for the pairs where \(b = 1\), which are always valid because \(a + 1\) is always a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(a, 1) = 1\).

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The edge cases and general logic are handled appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
