The only objects in the loop head are the variable `_` and the expression `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, the expression `n - 1` must evaluate to a positive integer. This means that `n` must be greater than 1. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.

State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists, `_` is a throwaway variable**
