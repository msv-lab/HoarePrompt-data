Precondition: **n is an integer representing the size of the chessboard, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5.** 

Note: The function definition provided does not match the problem description, as it should include parameters for the number of moves `k` and the list of moves `moves`. The correct function definition should be:

```
def func_1(t, test_cases):
```

Where `t` is the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing `n`, `k`, and a list of `k` moves. Each move is represented as a tuple `(r_i, c_i)` where `1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n`.
