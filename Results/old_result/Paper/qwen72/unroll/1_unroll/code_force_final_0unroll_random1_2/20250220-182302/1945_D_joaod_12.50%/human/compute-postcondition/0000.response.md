Output State: **t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and m are integers where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, a_i and b_i are lists of integers of length n where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, `cases` is an input integer.**

The value of `cases` is assigned the integer value provided by the user input. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i`) remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
