Output State: **The loop will print 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. The variables `i`, `n`, `l`, `lis`, and `test` will be in their final states after the loop completes, but their specific values are not retained after each iteration. The variable `t` will be unchanged as it is only used to determine the number of iterations.**
