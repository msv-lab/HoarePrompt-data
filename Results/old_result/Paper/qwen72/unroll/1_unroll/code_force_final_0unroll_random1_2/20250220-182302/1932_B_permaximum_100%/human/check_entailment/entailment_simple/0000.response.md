### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads each test case. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers.
   - The test cases are stored in a list `test_cases` for further processing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0, which represents the starting year.
   - It then iterates over each sign's periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
   - The logic to determine the next year when the sign occurs is:
     - If `current_year` is already a multiple of `ai`, the next year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next year is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which is the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`.
   - After processing all signs, the final `current_year` is appended to the `results` list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints each result in the `results` list, which is the year when the n-th sign occurs for each test case.

4. **Correctness of the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly ensures that the signs occur sequentially and strictly after the previous sign.
   - The calculation of the next year ensures that the sign occurs in the smallest possible year that is a multiple of the periodicity and is greater than the current year.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where all signs have a periodicity of 1 correctly. For example, in the third test case, the signs occur in years 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the final year is 5.
   - The program also handles cases where the periodicities are different and require more complex calculations to find the next occurrence.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the year when the n-th sign occurs and the apocalypse will happen, based on the given problem description and constraints.
