Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for determining the winner based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted set of pile sizes is flawed. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
3
1 2 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Alice
```

**Actual Output:**
```
Bob
```

In this case, the smallest pile has 1 stone, so Alice must remove 1 stone from each non-empty pile on her first turn. After Alice's turn, the piles will have 0, 1, and 3 stones respectively. Bob will then remove 1 stone from each non-empty pile, leaving 0, 0, and 2 stones. Alice will then remove 2 stones from the last pile, winning the game. However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" because it checks the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted set of pile sizes and incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the index. This logic does not accurately reflect the optimal play strategy for the game.
