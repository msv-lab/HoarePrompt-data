The code snippet defines a lambda function `R` that maps the input from `input().split()` to integers. This function can be used to read a sequence of integers from the input, where each integer is separated by spaces. The function itself does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `x`, or `y`, nor does it affect the list of `x` integers. However, it sets up a mechanism for reading input in a specific format.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer such that 0 <= y <= n - x, and the list of x integers are distinct and within the range 1 to n. `R` is a function that can read a sequence of space-separated integers from input.**
