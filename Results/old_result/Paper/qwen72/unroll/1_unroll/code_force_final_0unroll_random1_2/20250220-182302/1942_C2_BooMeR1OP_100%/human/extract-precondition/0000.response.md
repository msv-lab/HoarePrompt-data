Precondition: **The function `func` is expected to take input parameters that are not provided in the function definition. The correct function definition should include parameters `n`, `x`, `y`, and a list of `x` integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The input constraints are: 1 <= t <= 10^4, 4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), 0 <= y <= n - x, and the list of vertices Bessie has chosen contains distinct integers from 1 to n.**
