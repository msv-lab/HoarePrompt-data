The function `func_3` reads a line of input from the standard input stream, expecting the line to contain two space-separated integers. It then converts these integers from their string representation to actual integer values and returns them as a list. The function does not modify any external variables or state. After the function concludes, the user will have a list containing the two integers read from the input.
