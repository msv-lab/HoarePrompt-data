The function `func` accepts a list of strings as its parameter. The list contains `n` strings, where `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 24. Each string in the list is of length `n` and represents a row in a symmetric transition video plan matrix. The characters in each string can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (diagonal, no transition). The number of 'F' and 'S' characters in the entire matrix does not exceed 2 * floor(n / 2).

The function returns a value based on the input matrix:
- Case_1: If the matrix contains any invalid characters or if the number of 'F' and 'S' characters exceeds the allowed limit, the function returns an error message indicating the invalid input.
- Case_2: If the matrix is valid, the function returns a processed result based on the transition video plan.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing a symmetric transition video plan matrix with characters 'F', 'S', '?', and '.'. It returns an error message if the input is invalid (contains invalid characters or too many 'F' and 'S' characters). Otherwise, it returns a processed result based on the transition video plan.**
