You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 6 : The function `func_6` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It retrieves two integers `n` and `k` from the function `func_4`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and exits. Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with `n` and `k`, and then passes the result to `func_5`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function 4 (func_4):**
   - This function reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is odd. If `k` is odd, it returns `(0, 0)` because the Manhattan value of any permutation of length `n` is always even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. For even `n`, the maximum value is `n^2 / 2`, and for odd `n`, the maximum value is `(n^2 - 1) / 2`.
   - If `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

2. **Function 1 (func_1):**
   - This function generates a permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value of `k`.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the permutation `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - It divides `k` by 2 and iterates over the list in reverse order, skipping every other element.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `k` is zero. If so, it returns the current permutation.
   - If `k` is less than the current index minus 1, it calls `func_2` to swap elements and reduce `k`.
   - Otherwise, it reduces `k` by the current index minus 1 and calls `func_3` to swap elements.

3. **Function 2 (func_2):**
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k`.

4. **Function 3 (func_3):**
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to reduce `k` by a specific amount.
   - It swaps the elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c`.

5. **Function 5 (func_5):**
   - This function prints the permutation if it exists.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l`.

6. **Function 6 (func_6):**
   - This function orchestrates the entire process.
   - It calls `func_4` to get the input values and check if a valid permutation is possible.
   - If `n` is zero, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_5` to print it.

### Analysis:
- **Input Handling:** `func_4` correctly handles the input and checks if `k` is odd or exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value.
- **Permutation Generation:** `func_1` attempts to generate a permutation by iteratively swapping elements to reduce `k`. However, the logic for swapping elements in `func_2` and `func_3` seems to be incorrect and may not always produce a valid permutation with the required Manhattan value.
- **Output Handling:** `func_5` and `func_6` correctly handle the output, printing "YES" followed by the permutation or "NO" if no permutation is possible.

### Issues:
- **Swapping Logic:** The swapping logic in `func_2` and `func_3` is not clear and may not always produce a valid permutation with the required Manhattan value. Specifically, the indices used in the swaps might not be correct.
- **Edge Cases:** The function does not handle edge cases well, such as when `k` is zero or when `n` is 1.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect due to the issues in the swapping logic and the handling of edge cases.

### Correctness:
**False**
