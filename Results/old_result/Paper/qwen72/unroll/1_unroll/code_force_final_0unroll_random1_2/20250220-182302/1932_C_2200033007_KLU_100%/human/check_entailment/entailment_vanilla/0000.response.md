### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Processing the Commands:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to process the commands.
   - It initializes an empty list `b` to store the elements that are removed from the array `a` in the order of the commands.
   - It also initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the array `a`, respectively.

3. **Command Execution:**
   - The program iterates through each command in the string `s`.
   - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of the array `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
   - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of the array `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.

4. **Calculating the Product Modulo:**
   - After processing all commands, the program initializes an empty list `ans` to store the results.
   - It also initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will be used to keep track of the product of the remaining elements modulo `m`.
   - The program iterates through the elements in `b` in reverse order (since the last element removed should be the first one considered in the product).
   - For each element `v` in `b`, it updates `p` to be the product of `p` and `v` modulo `m` and appends `p` to `ans`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program returns the results in `ans` in reverse order to match the order of the commands.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly processes the commands and maintains the state of the array `a` as elements are removed.
- The product modulo `m` is calculated correctly for each state of the array.
- The results are returned in the correct order as specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
