Reasoning:  
The function `func_1` correctly processes the input time strings in 24-hour format and converts them to the 12-hour format with "AM" or "PM" as required. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading a time string `s` in the format "hh:mm".
2. **Hour Conversion**:
   - If the hour `h` is '00', it correctly converts it to '12' and appends "AM".
   - If the hour `h` is between '01' and '12', it correctly keeps the hour as is and appends "AM".
   - If the hour `h` is between '13' and '23', it correctly converts it to the 12-hour format by subtracting 12 from the hour and appends "PM".
3. **Minute Handling**: The minutes `mm` are directly appended to the output without any modification, which is correct.
4. **Output Format**: The function prints the time in the correct format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" for each test case.

The function handles all edge cases correctly, such as '00:00' and '12:00', and ensures that the output is formatted as required.

Correctness: **True**
