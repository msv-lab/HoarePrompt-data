### Reasoning:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**:
   - The function `func_1` is indeed flawed in its logic for determining the closest city. It should store the index of the closest city, not the distance to the closest city. The current implementation stores the distance to the next city if it is closer than the previous city, and 1 otherwise. This does not correctly identify the closest city.
   - The edge cases for `i = 0` and `i = n-1` are not handled correctly. For the first city, there is no previous city to compare with, and for the last city, there is no next city to compare with.

2. **Incorrect Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - The prefix sum arrays `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are being populated with the distances to the closest cities, but they should be populated with the minimum number of coins required to travel to the closest city. The current implementation does not correctly represent the minimum cost to travel between cities.
   - The prefix sum calculation is not correctly handling the logic of traveling to the closest city for each city. It should accumulate the minimum number of coins required to travel from the start city to each subsequent city.

3. **Incorrect Query Handling**:
   - The program is not correctly handling the queries. It is using the prefix sum arrays to calculate the minimum number of coins, but the prefix sum arrays are not correctly representing the minimum cost to travel between cities.
   - The logic for determining the minimum cost between two cities in the queries is flawed. It should use the precomputed closest city information to determine the minimum cost, but it is currently using the prefix sum arrays which are incorrectly populated.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because:
- `func_1` will not correctly determine the closest city for each city.
- The prefix sum arrays will not correctly represent the minimum cost to travel between cities.
- The query handling logic will use these incorrect prefix sum arrays to calculate the minimum number of coins.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Determine the closest city for each city.
2. Use dynamic programming or a similar approach to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel from any city to any other city.
3. Handle the queries efficiently using the precomputed minimum costs.

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not meet the requirements to correctly solve the problem, and it will produce incorrect results for the given example and other potential cases.

Final: **False**
