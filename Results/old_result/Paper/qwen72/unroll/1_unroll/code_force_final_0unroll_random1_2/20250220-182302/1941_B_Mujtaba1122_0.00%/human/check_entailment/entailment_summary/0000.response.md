Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if it is possible to make all elements of an array zero using a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)) and decrementing the elements at indices \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

### Analysis of `func_1`:
- `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- This function is straightforward and works as intended.

### Analysis of `func_2`:
- `func_2` attempts to apply the operation to the list to make all elements zero.
- The loop iterates over indices from 1 to \(n-2\) (inclusive).
- For each index \(i\), the function checks if the elements at \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) are greater than zero and \(list[i] > 1\).
- If these conditions are met, the function decrements the elements at \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by \(list[i-1]\), \(2 * list[i-1]\), and \(list[i-1]\) respectively.
- This is incorrect because the decrement should be by 1, 2, and 1, not by \(list[i-1]\), \(2 * list[i-1]\), and \(list[i-1]\).

### Issues with `func_2`:
- The decrement logic is flawed. Instead of decrementing by 1, 2, and 1, it decrements by \(list[i-1]\), \(2 * list[i-1]\), and \(list[i-1]\).
- This will lead to incorrect results because the operation should only decrement by fixed values (1, 2, 1) and not by the value of the previous element.

### Correct Implementation:
- The correct implementation should decrement the elements at \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
- The loop should continue as long as the elements at \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) are greater than zero and \(list[i] > 1\).

### Example:
For the array `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`:
- The correct sequence of operations would be:
  - Apply operation at \(i=4\): `[1, 3, 4, 3, 1]`
  - Apply operation at \(i=3\): `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1]`
  - Apply operation at \(i=2\): `[0, 0, 1, 2, 1]`
  - Apply operation at \(i=4\): `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

### Conclusion:
The current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect due to the flawed decrement logic. Therefore, the program as a whole is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
