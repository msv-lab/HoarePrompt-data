Correctness: **False**.

Explanation:
The given program does not correctly handle all potential cases. One specific issue is that it does not check if the elements of the array can be reduced to zero in a way that maintains non-negative values throughout the process. Here is a counterexample:

**Input:**
```
1
5
1 2 3 2 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

**Actual Output:**
```
NO
```

**Reason:**
The program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this input. However, it is possible to make all elements zero using the described operations:

1. Apply the operation at \( i = 2 \):
   - \( a_1 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - \( a_2 = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
   - \( a_3 = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
   - Array becomes: \( [0, 0, 2, 2, 1] \)

2. Apply the operation at \( i = 3 \):
   - \( a_2 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (This step is invalid because \( a_2 \) becomes negative, but the program does not handle this correctly)
   - \( a_3 = 2 - 2 = 0 \)
   - \( a_4 = 2 - 1 = 1 \)
   - Array becomes: \( [0, -1, 0, 1, 1] \)

3. Apply the operation at \( i = 4 \):
   - \( a_3 = 0 - 1 = -1 \) (This step is invalid because \( a_3 \) becomes negative)
   - \( a_4 = 1 - 2 = -1 \)
   - \( a_5 = 1 - 1 = 0 \)
   - Array becomes: \( [0, -1, -1, -1, 0] \)

The program does not correctly handle the case where the elements can be reduced to zero without any intermediate negative values. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
