### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for processing the string `s` and calculating the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell.
   - The function initializes two lists `A` and `B` to store the cumulative times for pinballs moving to the right and left, respectively.
   - It also initializes two lists `idx_A` and `idx_B` to store the indices of the cells where the pinball moves to the right and left, respectively.

3. **Calculating `A` and `idx_A`**:
   - The first loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right.
   - If the current character is '>', it calculates the cumulative time for the pinball to move to the right and appends it to `A`.
   - It also appends the current index to `idx_A`.

4. **Calculating `B` and `idx_B`**:
   - The second loop iterates over the string `s` from right to left.
   - If the current character is '<', it calculates the cumulative time for the pinball to move to the left and appends it to `B`.
   - It also appends the current index to `idx_B`.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program then iterates over each cell in the grid and calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid based on the cumulative times stored in `A` and `B`.
   - The logic for calculating the time is complex and involves multiple conditions to handle different scenarios:
     - If the current cell is '>', it uses the cumulative times from `A` and `B` to calculate the total time.
     - If the current cell is '<', it uses the cumulative times from `A` and `B` to calculate the total time.
   - The program prints the calculated time for each cell in the grid.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the grid is entirely composed of '<' or '>'.
   - It also handles cases where the grid has a mix of '<' and '>'.

7. **Complexity**:
   - The program has a time complexity of O(n) for each test case, which is efficient given the constraints.

### Correctness:
The program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided example. It correctly calculates the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid from each cell and handles all edge cases.

**Correctness: True**
