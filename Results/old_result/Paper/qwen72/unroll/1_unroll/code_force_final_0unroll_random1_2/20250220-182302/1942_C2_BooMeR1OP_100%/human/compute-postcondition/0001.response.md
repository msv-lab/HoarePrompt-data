The only object in the loop head is the variable `_` and the variable `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be adjusted, as it is used to indicate that the loop variable is not used within the loop body. The state of `func` and its parameters are not part of the loop head and thus cannot be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
