### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep their current wallet, and then remove one coin from their current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a valid move (i.e., cannot remove a coin because the wallet is empty) loses the game.
   - The goal is to determine the winner if both play optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The key to solving this problem is to recognize that the game is essentially a parity-based game.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is even, Bob will always win if both play optimally. This is because Bob can always mirror Alice's moves, ensuring that he is the one to make the last move.
   - If the total number of coins (a + b) is odd, Alice will always win if both play optimally. This is because Alice can always make the first move, and then mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that she is the one to make the last move.

3. **Function Analysis:**
   - **`func_1(a, b)`**:
     - This function checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd.
     - If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'.
     - If the sum is odd, it returns 'Alice'.
     - This function correctly implements the optimal strategy based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - **`func_2()`**:
     - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
     - For each test case, it reads the values of `a` and `b`, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and appends the result to a list `results`.
     - Finally, it prints each result in the `results` list.
     - The function correctly handles the input and output as described in the problem statement.

4. **Verification:**
   - The provided example test cases match the expected output based on the parity of the total number of coins.
   - For example:
     - (1, 1) -> Total: 2 (even) -> Bob wins.
     - (1, 4) -> Total: 5 (odd) -> Alice wins.
     - (5, 3) -> Total: 8 (even) -> Bob wins.
     - (4, 5) -> Total: 9 (odd) -> Alice wins.
     - And so on.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins and handles the input and output as required by the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
