#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case: n is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of cities; a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; m is an integer where 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, representing the number of queries; queries is a list of m tuples (x_i, y_i) where 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i, representing the pairs of cities for which the minimum travel cost needs to be calculated. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and `queries` remain unchanged. The dictionaries `d1` and `d2` are populated with the minimum travel costs for each city, and the results of the queries are printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` processes multiple test cases, each containing a list of city coordinates and a set of queries. For each query, it calculates and prints the minimum travel cost between two specified cities. The function reads input from the user, including the number of test cases, the number of cities, the city coordinates, the number of queries, and the queries themselves. It populates two dictionaries, `d1` and `d2`, with the minimum travel costs for each city, and uses these dictionaries to compute the travel costs for the queries. The function does not modify the input values but prints the results of the queries directly.
