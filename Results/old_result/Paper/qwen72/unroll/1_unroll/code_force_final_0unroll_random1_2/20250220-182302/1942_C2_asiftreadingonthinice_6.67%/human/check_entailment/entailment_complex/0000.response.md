### Reasoning:

1. **Function Signature and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func` is designed to handle multiple test cases, which is in line with the problem description.
   - It reads the number of test cases `tt` and then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input, and a list of `x` vertices that Bessie has chosen.
   - The vertices are sorted, which is a necessary step for the algorithm to work correctly.

2. **Initial Triangle Count:**
   - The initial count of triangles `ans` is set to `x + y - 2`. This is a good starting point because each vertex can potentially form a triangle with two others, but we need to ensure that the diagonals do not intersect.

3. **Handling Vertex Gaps:**
   - The function iterates over the sorted list of chosen vertices and checks the gaps between consecutive vertices.
   - If the gap is exactly 2, it adds 1 to `ans` because a triangle can be formed by the two chosen vertices and the one in between.
   - If the gap is even and greater than 2, it checks if there are enough remaining vertices (`y`) to fill the gap. If so, it adds the number of triangles that can be formed by filling the gap and decreases `y` accordingly.

4. **Handling the Wrap-Around Gap:**
   - The function also checks the gap between the last and the first vertex in the sorted list, considering the polygon's wrap-around nature.
   - Similar to the previous step, it adds triangles if the gap is exactly 2 or if it is even and can be filled with the remaining vertices.

5. **Final Triangle Count:**
   - After processing all gaps, it adds the remaining vertices `y` to `ans` to account for any additional triangles that can be formed.
   - The final result is the minimum of `ans` and `n - 2`, which ensures that the number of triangles does not exceed the maximum possible number of non-overlapping triangles in a polygon with `n` sides.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the result for each test case, which is the correct way to handle the output according to the problem description.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Condition for Wrap-Around Gap:**
  - The condition `if (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:` is incorrect. It should be `if (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1:` to correctly handle the wrap-around gap.
  - The use of `a[i] - a[i - 1]` in the wrap-around condition is a mistake because `i` is not defined in that context.

### Correctness:
- **False**: The function contains a logical error in handling the wrap-around gap, which can lead to incorrect results for some test cases.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def max_triangles(t, n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    for ii in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, chosen_vertices[ii][:3])
        a = list(map(int, chosen_vertices[ii][3:]))
        
        a.sort()
        
        ans = x + y - 2
        
        tmp = []
        
        for i in range(1, len(a)):
            if a[i] - a[i - 1] == 2:
                ans += 1
            elif (a[i] - a[i - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1:
                tmp.append((a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2)
                ans += (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2
                y -= (a[i] - a[i - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        if a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
        elif (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) % 2 == 0 and y > (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1:
            tmp.append((a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2)
            ans += (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2
            y -= (a[0] + n - a[len(a) - 1]) // 2 - 1
        
        ans += y
        
        print(min(ans, n - 2))

# Example usage:
t = 3
test_cases = [
    [8, 4, 2, 1, 6, 2, 5],
    [7, 3, 1, 6, 4, 3],
    [4, 2, 2, 1, 3]
]

max_triangles(t, *test_cases[0])
max_triangles(t, *test_cases[1])
max_triangles(t, *test_cases[2])
```

### Final Correctness:
- **Correctness: False** due to the logical error in handling the wrap-around gap.
