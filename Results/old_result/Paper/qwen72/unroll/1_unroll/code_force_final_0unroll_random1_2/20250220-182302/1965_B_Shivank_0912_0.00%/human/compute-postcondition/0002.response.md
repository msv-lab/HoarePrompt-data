The only objects in the loop head are the variables `n`, `k`, and the list `cases`, so we can only adjust those. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `cases`. If `cases` has at least one tuple, the loop will execute. The variable `t` is not part of the loop head, so it does not need to be adjusted. The `results` list and `sequence` list are not part of the loop head either, so they do not need to be adjusted.

For the loop to execute, `cases` must have at least one tuple, and the tuple `(n, k)` must be the first element of `cases`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `(n, k)` is the first tuple in `cases`, `results` is an empty list, `sequence` is a list of 25 elements where each element is 2 raised to the power of its index (i.e., `sequence[0] = 1`, `sequence[1] = 2`, `sequence[2] = 4`, ..., `sequence[24] = 16777216`)**
