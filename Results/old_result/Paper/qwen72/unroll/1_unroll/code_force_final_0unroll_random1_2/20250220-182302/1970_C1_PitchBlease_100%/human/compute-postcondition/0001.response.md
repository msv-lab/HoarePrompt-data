Output State: **`start` and `target` are integers representing the indices of nodes in the tree, where 1 <= `start`, `target` <= `n`, and `tree` is a dictionary or list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree. `queue` is a deque initialized with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. `visited` is a set containing the integer `start`.** 

The initial state remains unchanged, except that the `visited` set now contains the integer `start`.
