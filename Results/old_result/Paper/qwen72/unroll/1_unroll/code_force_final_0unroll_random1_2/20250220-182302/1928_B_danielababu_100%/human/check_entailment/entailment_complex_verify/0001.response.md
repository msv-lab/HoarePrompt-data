### Reasoning:

The provided program aims to solve the problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in an array after adding a permutation to it. Let's analyze the program step by step to see if it correctly implements the solution.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` using `func_1()` and the array elements using `func_3()`.

2. **Processing the Array:**
   - The array `arr` is converted to a set and then sorted. This ensures that all elements in `arr` are unique and in ascending order.
   - The maximum element in the sorted array `m` is determined using `max(arr)`.

3. **Finding the Maximum Frequency:**
   - The program initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the maximum number of equal elements.
   - It iterates over each element in the sorted array `arr`.
   - For each element `arr[i]`, it uses `bisect_left` to find the position `a` in the sorted array where `arr[i] + n` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
   - The difference `d = a - i` represents the number of elements in the array that can be transformed to a value between `arr[i] + 1` and `arr[i] + n`.
   - The program updates `ans` with the maximum value of `d`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis of the Provided Functions:

- **`func_1`**: Reads a single integer from the input.
- **`func_3`**: Reads a list of integers from the input.
- **`bisect_left`**: Used to find the insertion point in a sorted list, which helps in determining the range of possible values.

### Correctness of the Program:

1. **Unique and Sorted Array:**
   - Converting the array to a set and then sorting it ensures that all elements are unique and in ascending order. This is a valid approach because the problem involves finding the maximum number of equal elements, and duplicates in the original array do not affect the final result.

2. **Using `bisect_left`:**
   - The use of `bisect_left` to find the position where `arr[i] + n` would be inserted is a clever way to determine the range of possible values that can be achieved by adding a permutation element to `arr[i]`.
   - The difference `d = a - i` correctly represents the number of elements in the array that can be transformed to a value between `arr[i] + 1` and `arr[i] + n`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the correct result for each test case.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It efficiently finds the maximum number of elements that can be made equal in the array after adding a permutation. The use of `bisect_left` and the unique and sorted array approach are both valid and effective.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct and solves the problem as described.
