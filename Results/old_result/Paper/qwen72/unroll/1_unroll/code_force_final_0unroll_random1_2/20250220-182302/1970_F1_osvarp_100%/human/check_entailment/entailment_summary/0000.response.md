### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads the dimensions of the grid `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It initializes the grid and several dictionaries and lists to keep track of the positions of players, the Quaffle, and the goals.
   - The `elements` dictionary is used to store the current positions of all entities on the grid.
   - The `allPlayers` dictionary is used to track whether a player is currently carrying the Quaffle.
   - The `goal` list contains the positions of the red and blue goals.
   - The `points` list is used to keep track of the scores for the red and blue teams.

2. **Command Processing:**
   - The function processes a series of commands over `t` time steps.
   - For each command, it updates the positions of players and the Quaffle.
   - It correctly handles the following actions:
     - **Movement (U, D, L, R):** The function updates the position of the entity performing the action.
     - **Catching the Quaffle (C):** The function updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is carrying the Quaffle.
     - **Throwing the Quaffle (T):** The function updates the `allPlayers` dictionary to indicate that the player is no longer carrying the Quaffle.
     - **Scoring a Goal:** The function checks if the player is at a goal of the opposing team and updates the score accordingly. It also prints the appropriate message and resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field.
     - **Elimination:** The function checks if a player is eliminated by another player and prints the appropriate message.

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - **`goalIn(pos)`:** This function correctly determines if a given position `pos` is a goal and returns the appropriate team index.
   - **`isPlayer(el)`:** This function correctly identifies if a given string `el` represents a player (i.e., it starts with 'B' or 'R' and is not a goal).

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the main events of the game, including goals scored and the final score.
   - The final score is printed in the correct format: `FINAL SCORE: r b`, where `r` is the score of the red team and `b` is the score of the blue team.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where a player scores in their own goal, awarding the point to the opposing team.
   - The function ensures that the Quaffle is always reset to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.
   - The function correctly processes the commands in the order they are given and prints the events in ascending order of time.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input, updates the game state, and prints the correct output for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct.
