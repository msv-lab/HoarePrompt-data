### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and the list of message times `arr`.

2. **Charge Calculation:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `array2` to store the charge consumption for each message.
   - It iterates through the list of message times `arr`:
     - For the first message, it checks if the initial charge `f` is sufficient to send the message without turning the phone off and on. If `arr[0] < b / a`, it appends `arr[0] * a` to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages, it checks if the time difference between consecutive messages is less than the time it would take to turn the phone off and on. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a`, it appends `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a` to `array2`.

3. **Total Charge Consumption:**
   - The function calculates the total charge consumption for sending messages without turning the phone off and on using `sum(array2)`.
   - It then adds the fixed cost of turning the phone off and on for each message that was not included in `array2` using `(n - len(array2)) * b`.
   - Finally, it checks if the total charge consumption is less than the initial charge `f`.

4. **Output:**
   - If the total charge consumption is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues:
- **Incorrect Condition for First Message:**
  - The condition `if arr[0] < b / a` is incorrect. It should be `if arr[0] * a <= f` to check if the initial charge is sufficient to send the first message.
- **Incorrect Condition for Subsequent Messages:**
  - The condition `elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a` is incorrect. It should be `elif (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a <= f - sum(array2) - (i - len(array2)) * b` to check if the remaining charge is sufficient to send the message without turning the phone off and on.
- **Charge Calculation for Turning On and Off:**
  - The function incorrectly calculates the charge consumption for turning the phone on and off. It should consider the remaining charge after sending each message and decide whether to turn the phone off and on based on the remaining charge.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the remaining charge
        remaining_charge = f
        
        # Check if the initial charge is sufficient to send the first message
        if arr[0] * a > f:
            print('No')
            continue
        
        # Subtract the charge for the first message
        remaining_charge -= arr[0] * a
        
        # Iterate through the remaining messages
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Calculate the charge needed to send the next message
            charge_needed = (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a
            
            # Check if the remaining charge is sufficient to send the next message
            if charge_needed <= remaining_charge:
                remaining_charge -= charge_needed
            else:
                # Check if turning the phone off and on is possible
                if b > remaining_charge:
                    print('No')
                    break
                else:
                    remaining_charge -= b
                    remaining_charge -= charge_needed
        else:
            # If the loop completes without breaking, all messages can be sent
            print('Yes')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Correctness:
- **False**

The original program has logical errors in the conditions used to determine if the phone can send messages without running out of charge. The corrected program addresses these issues and should work correctly for the given problem description.
