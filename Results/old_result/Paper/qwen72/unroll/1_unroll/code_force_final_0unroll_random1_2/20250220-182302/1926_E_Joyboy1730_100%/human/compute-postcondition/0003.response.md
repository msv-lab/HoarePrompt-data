The function `func` accepts no parameters directly within its definition. However, based on the parameter constraints provided, it is implied that the function operates within a context where `t`, `n`, and `k` are integers. `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 · 10^4, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result for each test case, but the specific output is not provided in the constraints. 

Given the context, we can infer that the function likely processes these test cases and returns a result based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case is defined by two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. It returns a result for each test case, but the specific nature of the result is not provided in the constraints.**
