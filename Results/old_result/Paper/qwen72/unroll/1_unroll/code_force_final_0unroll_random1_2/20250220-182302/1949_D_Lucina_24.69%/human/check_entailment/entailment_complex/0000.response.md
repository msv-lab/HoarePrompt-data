Reasoning:

1. **Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the integer `n` and the list of `n` strings, each of length `n`, representing the transition video plan matrix.
   - The matrix is stored in `xx` with an extra empty string at the beginning to make indexing easier.
   - The lists `a` and `b` are initialized to count the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in each row and column, respectively.

2. **Counting 'F' and 'S'**:
   - The program iterates through each row and column to update the counts in `a` and `b`.
   - This ensures that `a[i]` and `b[i]` correctly represent the number of 'F' and 'S' characters in the i-th row and column, respectively.

3. **Identifying Rows and Columns**:
   - The program creates two lists, `sa` and `sb`, to store the indices of rows and columns with specific characteristics:
     - `sa` contains indices of rows with at least one 'F' and no 'S'.
     - `sb` contains indices of columns with at least one 'S' and no 'F'.
   - This step is crucial for determining how to replace the '?' characters.

4. **Handling Undecided Characters**:
   - The program checks the lengths of `sa` and `sb` to decide the strategy for replacing '?' characters.
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, it replaces '?' characters in the first quarter of `sa` with 'F' and the rest with 'S'.
   - If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, it replaces '?' characters in the first quarter of `sb` with 'S' and the rest with 'F'.
   - This approach ensures that the number of consecutive 'F' or 'S' characters does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the modified matrix, ensuring that all '?' characters are replaced with either 'F' or 'S' while maintaining the symmetry of the matrix and the constraints on consecutive characters.

6. **Constraints and Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints of the problem correctly, ensuring that the number of 'F' and 'S' characters does not exceed the allowed limits.
   - The program also ensures that the matrix remains symmetric and that the diagonal elements remain '.'.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. However, there is a potential issue in the way the program handles the replacement of '?' characters, especially in the context of ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive characters of the same type are present in any permutation of the scenarios.

### Potential Issue:
- The program only considers the first quarter of `sa` or `sb` for replacing '?' characters, which might not be sufficient to ensure that no permutation of scenarios results in more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' characters. A more sophisticated approach might be needed to ensure this constraint is met for all permutations.

### Conclusion:
- Despite the potential issue, the program does follow the basic logic required to solve the problem. However, the approach to replacing '?' characters might not be robust enough to guarantee the constraint on consecutive characters for all permutations.

Correctness: **False** (due to the potential issue with ensuring the constraint on consecutive characters for all permutations)
