You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func` reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n` from the input. The function then calculates and prints the maximum divisor of `x` that satisfies the conditions `(x - n * i) % i == 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` for each divisor `i` of `x` up to the square root of `x`. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of `n` sub-problems such that their sum is equal to `x`.
   - The GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties will be the balance of the problemset.

2. **Input and Output**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases, each with two integers `x` and `n`.
   - For each test case, the output should be the maximum possible GCD of the difficulties of the `n` sub-problems.

3. **Approach**:
   - The program iterates through all possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
   - If `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`, it updates the maximum GCD found so far.
   - It also checks the same condition for the complementary divisor `x // i`.

4. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
   - **Iterating Divisors**: It iterates through all divisors of `x` from 1 to `sqrt(x)`.
   - **Checking Conditions**:
     - If `x % i == 0`, then `i` is a divisor of `x`.
     - It checks if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` to ensure that `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems with each sub-problem having a difficulty that is a multiple of `i`.
     - Similarly, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` for the complementary divisor `x // i`.
   - **Updating Maximum GCD**: If either condition is satisfied, it updates the maximum GCD found so far.
   - **Printing Result**: After processing all divisors, it prints the maximum GCD for the current test case.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n == x` by checking if `x` can be divided into `n` sub-problems of difficulty 1.
   - It also handles the case where `n == 1` by returning `x` itself as the GCD.

6. **Efficiency**:
   - The program efficiently reduces the number of checks by only iterating up to the square root of `x`, which is a common optimization for divisor-related problems.

### Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies the maximum GCD of the difficulties of the sub-problems by iterating through all possible divisors and checking the conditions.
- The conditions ensure that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x` and that each sub-problem's difficulty is a multiple of the GCD.
- The program handles all edge cases and constraints as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
