Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup and Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field (N and M) and initializes dictionaries for players and goals.
   - It correctly parses the field and populates the `players` and `goals` dictionaries.
   - The `quidditch` list is initialized to keep track of the Quaffle's position and the player carrying it.

2. **Movement Function:**
   - The `func_1` function is intended to update the position of an entity based on a movement direction.
   - However, there is a critical error in the function: the movement directions are stored as tuples in the `mouvements` dictionary, but the function attempts to unpack `b` directly, which is a tuple. This results in a `ValueError` because `b` cannot be unpacked into `dx` and `dy`.

3. **Game Simulation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of moves and simulates each move.
   - For player movements (indicated by 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'), the program updates the player's position.
   - The program correctly checks for player elimination by the Bludger and prints the elimination events in the correct order.
   - The program handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle, but the logic for catching the Quaffle is incorrect. The line `quidditch[1] == mo[0]` should be `quidditch[1] = mo[0]` to assign the player who caught the Quaffle.
   - The program correctly checks if a player scores a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - The program correctly resets the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field after a goal is scored.

4. **Final Score Output:**
   - The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given the issues identified, particularly the `ValueError` in `func_1` and the incorrect assignment in the catching logic, the program is **incorrect**.

Correctness: **False**
